Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa would curtail Energy Department rules on refrigerators. A separate measure by New York Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy would bar the administration from implementing or enforcing new efficiency rules if they are not \"cost-effective or technologically feasible\" and result in significant energy conservation.\n\nThe refrigerator bill was approved, 212-192, while the dishwasher measure was adopted, 214-192. Both bills now go to the Democratic-controlled Senate where they are unlikely to advance.\n\nThe White House said it strongly opposes both measures but stopped short of a veto threat if the bills reach Biden's desk.\n\nThe bills include \"vague\" and misleading language that \"would add uncertainty to the implementation of these (efficiency) standards and create unnecessary hurdles for DOE in making future updates,'' the White House said in a statement.\n\nLangworthy said his bill, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards, or SUDS Act, would \"put the brakes on the Biden administration's relentless assault on efficient, affordable and reliable appliances for everyday Americans through overbearing regulations.''\n\nThe Energy Department and other agencies have \"abused and twisted\" a 1970s-era law aimed at energy conservation in order \"to serve the radical, woke, environmental agenda of the far left,'' Langworthy said during debate on the House floor. \"Why should Americans who are putting their groceries on credit cards be forced to deal with more out-of-touch expensive regulations?''\n\nMiller-Meeks used similar language, saying the Biden administration has implemented \"outrageous regulations that only serve to limit consumer choice, increase energy prices and control everything Americans are able to do on a day-to-day basis.''\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Republicans had it wrong. Instead of lowering costs, the proposals would increase home energy bills for American families, he said.\n\nEnergy efficiency standards \"save Americans money on their energy bills, boost innovation by modernizing appliances for the future and reduce greenhouse gas pollution in our ongoing efforts to combat the climate crisis,'' Pallone said.\n\nCurrent and planned actions by the Biden administration on energy efficiency will save Americans $1 trillion over the next 30 years and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 billion metric tons, Pallone said.\n\nPallone, who has served in Congress for 36 years, said energy efficiency \"used to be a bipartisan issue, but not anymore. Extreme Republicans have decided that they'd rather do the bidding of corporate polluters as they continue to move forward with their polluters-over-people agenda.''\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the Republican chair of the energy panel, said modern appliances such as the home dishwasher and refrigerator \"were not the result of aggressive government mandates or regulation, but of American ingenuity.\"\n\n\"Sadly,\" she added, \"the Biden administration's war on American energy is now reaching inside Americans' homes\" to what she called \"out-of-control appliance mandates.''\n\nRep. Katie Porter, D-California, said many Republicans who back the appliance measures don't even know how dishwashers work or how much they cost.\n\n\"I know a lot about dishwashers, because I'm a single mom and I load and unload and load and unload and rinse and buy detergent,'' Porter said.\n\nShe asked if Republican colleagues know how much it costs per month to run an average dishwasher. When no one replied, Porter answered her own question, saying typical costs are about $2 to $4 a month. \"In other words, about one-third of a frappuccino,'' she said.\n\nContrary to Republican claims that dishwashers often don't work correctly because of complicated federal rules, the most important factor to ensure clean dishes \"is loading it correctly,'' Porter said.\n\n\"This bill is ridiculous,'' she added. \"It is Congress at its worst. A bunch of people who haven't unloaded a dishwasher ever telling the American people ... what kind of dishwashers they should or should not be able to buy.''\n\nSeven Democrats supported both bills. Michigan Rep. John Moolenaar was the only Republican to oppose the refrigerator bill.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa would curtail Energy Department rules on refrigerators. A separate measure by New York Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy would bar the administration from implementing or enforcing new efficiency rules if they are not \"cost-effective or technologically feasible\" and result in significant energy conservation.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Both bills now go to the Democratic-controlled Senate where they are unlikely to advance.\n\nThe White House said it strongly opposes both measures but stopped short of a veto threat if the bills reach Biden's desk.\n\nThe bills include \"vague\" and misleading language that \"would add uncertainty to the implementation of these (efficiency) standards and create unnecessary hurdles for DOE in making future updates,'' the White House said in a statement.\n\nLangworthy said his bill, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards, or SUDS Act, would \"put the brakes on the Biden administration's relentless assault on efficient, affordable and reliable appliances for everyday Americans through overbearing regulations.''\n\nThe Energy Department and other agencies have \"abused and twisted\" a 1970s-era law aimed at energy conservation in order \"to serve the radical, woke, environmental agenda of the far left,'' Langworthy said during debate on the House floor. \"Why should Americans who are putting their groceries on credit cards be forced to deal with more out-of-touch expensive regulations?''\n\nMiller-Meeks used similar language, saying the Biden administration has implemented \"outrageous regulations that only serve to limit consumer choice, increase energy prices and control everything Americans are able to do on a day-to-day basis.''\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Republicans had it wrong. Instead of lowering costs, the proposals would increase home energy bills for American families, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nEnergy efficiency standards \"save Americans money on their energy bills, boost innovation by modernizing appliances for the future and reduce greenhouse gas pollution in our ongoing efforts to combat the climate crisis,'' Pallone said.\n\nCurrent and planned actions by the Biden administration on energy efficiency will save Americans $1 trillion over the next 30 years and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 billion metric tons, Pallone said.\n\nPallone, who has served in Congress for 36 years, said energy efficiency \"used to be a bipartisan issue, but not anymore. Extreme Republicans have decided that they'd rather do the bidding of corporate polluters as they continue to move forward with their polluters-over-people agenda.''\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the Republican chair of the energy panel, said modern appliances such as the home dishwasher and refrigerator \"were not the result of aggressive government mandates or regulation, but of American ingenuity.\"\n\n\"Sadly,\" she added, \"the Biden administration's war on American energy is now reaching inside Americans' homes\" to what she called \"out-of-control appliance mandates.''\n\nRep. Katie Porter, D-California, said many Republicans who back the appliance measures don't even know how dishwashers work or how much they cost.\n\n\"I know a lot about dishwashers, because I'm a single mom and I load and unload and load and unload and rinse and buy detergent,'' Porter said.\n\nShe asked if Republican colleagues know how much it costs per month to run an average dishwasher. When no one replied, Porter answered her own question, saying typical costs are about $2 to $4 a month. \"In other words, about one-third of a frappuccino,'' she said.\n\nContrary to Republican claims that dishwashers often don't work correctly because of complicated federal rules, the most important factor to ensure clean dishes \"is loading it correctly,'' Porter said.\n\n\"This bill is ridiculous,'' she added. \"It is Congress at its worst. A bunch of people who haven't unloaded a dishwasher ever telling the American people ... what kind of dishwashers they should or should not be able to buy.''\n\nSeven Democrats supported both bills. Michigan Rep. John Moolenaar was the only Republican to oppose the refrigerator bill. No Republican voted against the dishwasher bill.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a statement of administration policy on Monday, the White House said that the measures would \"add vague, red-herring provisions\" that would create uncertainty around applying regulations in future updates to efficiency standards.\n\nBoth sets of standards from the Biden administration are part of a broader swath of stricter energy regulations from the administration that the Energy Department projected to save roughly $1 trillion in consumer savings over the next three decades.\n\nFull compliance under the dishwasher and refrigerator standards would not kick in until the end of the decade, according to the Energy Department, and combined would save consumers nearly $40 billion over the next 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats argued that the bills would have the opposite effect, and would add burdensome language to the efficiency standard-making process while increasing the average energy costs for consumers.\n\nThey also contend that Congress had much better things to do than fight for \"refrigerator freedom,\" and that the House already passed a bill related to home appliances, the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act, earlier this year.\n\nThat bill would force the Energy Department to consider the cost-effectiveness of any new policy standards, like any updates affecting home appliances that would hit low-income families, and would demand that the agency consider the lifetime costs of those appliances before issuing new standards.\n\nDemocrats also spent much of the debate on the bills making a mockery of both measures.\n\n\"We're not in Home Depot, we're in the House of Representatives,\" said Rep. James McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_miller@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Alex Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dishwasher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Langworthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Langworthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariannette_Miller-Meeks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mariannette Miller-Meeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home appliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGovern_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGovern (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/02/15/Retail_Sales_05467_c0-335-4006-2670_s1770x1032.jpg?8b6ae05f2394a3a4725dd87c3560f38b08674eaa", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717941", "eventUri": "eng-9717941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Hot topics at the hearing included Title IX, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, and several other proposed bills aimed at standards for household appliances.\n\nThe Republican-led home appliance bills that were discussed at the committee hearing included H.R. 7700, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act, and H.R. 7637, the Refrigerator Freedom Act.\n\nThe Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act is aimed at preventing the Department of Energy from enforcing or updating new energy conservation standards for dishwashers, \"unless the standards are determined by the department to be technologically feasible,\" according to the Congressional Budget Office's summary of the bill.\n\n\"The bill would prohibit DOE from issuing, updating, or enforcing energy conservation standards for the affected appliances unless the standards are determined by the department to be technologically feasible, economically justified, unlikely to increase net costs for consumers, and to provide significant energy savings,\" CBO said.\n\nThe Refrigerator Freedom Act, which was originally introduced in March, would prevent the Secretary of Energy from rolling out similarly restrictive rules for refrigerators.\n\nMany House Republicans have expressed strong opinions on these energy conservation appliance rules in the past leading up to this hearing.\n\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, sponsored the bill for The Refrigerator Freedom Act, which was introduced in March.\n\n\"The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden Administration have done nothing but implement outrageous regulations that only serve to limit consumer choice, increase energy prices, and control everything Americans are able to do on a day-to-day basis,\" Miller-Meeks said in a press release when it was introduced. \"I'm proud that my bill passed the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I will continue to ensure American consumers have freedom to choose what type of appliances they want in their own home.\"\n\nOthers have praised the energy standards, expressing concerns about environmental harm.\n\nOverall, though, costs to the average American remain at the center of the debate.\n\n\"These appliance regulations almost always hurt consumers because they take away consumer choices,\" Senior Fellow at Competitive Enterprise Institute Ben Lieberman told The Center Square. \"Keep in mind if you want to choose the ultra efficient dishwasher or air conditioner, that's always an option for you, but what these standards do is they force that option on everyone whether it makes sense for you or not.\n\n\"These appliance regulations tend to raise the upfront costs of these appliances, so if it's an appliance you plan on using sparingly, you may never earn back that higher upfront costs in the form of reduced energy savings over the life of the appliance,\" Lieberman said.\n\nThere remains a questions about costs, since rules can make appliances more expensive but also save consumers money at times by designing them to use less water or electrcity.\n\n\"Energy efficiency standards make the household products we use every day better and more efficient, while saving consumers money,\" Andrew deLaski, executive director of The Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a statement from May.\n\nSeveral Republicans criticized the current appliance efficiency standards during the Rules Committee hearing.\n\n\"So under this rule and based on what anyone who uses appliances regularly would know, most Americans will never see the savings laid out in the proposed rule,\" Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Penn, slammed the Republican's proposed household appliance bills during the hearing.\n\n\"I can't believe that we're here with refrigerator freedom and laundry liberty again, I mean, I thought we'd beaten this horse to death,\" Scanlon said during the hearing. \"It does seem after the Fourth of July that we can pledge allegiance to the fridge of the United States of America and to the dishwasher for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible except for gas stoves, with liberty and justice for all appliances.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news",

Both bills now go to the Democratic-controlled Senate where they are unlikely to advance.\n\nThe White House said it strongly opposes both measures but stopped short of a veto threat if the bills reach Biden's desk.\n\nThe bills include \"vague\" and misleading language that \"would add uncertainty to the implementation of these (efficiency) standards and create unnecessary hurdles for DOE in making future updates,'' the White House said in a statement.\n\nLangworthy said his bill, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards, or SUDS Act, would \"put the brakes on the Biden administration's relentless assault on efficient, affordable and reliable appliances for everyday Americans through overbearing regulations.''\n\nThe Energy Department and other agencies have \"abused and twisted\" a 1970s-era law aimed at energy conservation in order \"to serve the radical, woke, environmental agenda of the far left,'' Langworthy said during debate on the House floor. \"Why should Americans who are putting their groceries on credit cards be forced to deal with more out-of-touch expensive regulations?''\n\nMiller-Meeks used similar language, saying the Biden administration has implemented \"outrageous regulations that only serve to limit consumer choice, increase energy prices and control everything Americans are able to do on a day-to-day basis.''\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Republicans had it wrong. Instead of lowering costs, the proposals would increase home energy bills for American families, he said.\n\nEnergy efficiency standards \"save Americans money on their energy bills, boost innovation by modernizing appliances for the future and reduce greenhouse gas pollution in our ongoing efforts to combat the climate crisis,'' Pallone said.\n\nCurrent and planned actions by the Biden administration on energy efficiency will save Americans $1 trillion over the next 30 years and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 billion metric tons, Pallone said.\n\nPallone, who has served in Congress for 36 years, said energy efficiency \"used to be a bipartisan issue, but not anymore. Extreme Republicans have decided that they'd rather do the bidding of corporate polluters as they continue to move forward with their polluters-over-people agenda.''\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the Republican chair of the energy panel, said modern appliances such as the home dishwasher and refrigerator \"were not the result of aggressive government mandates or regulation, but of American ingenuity.\"\n\n\"Sadly,\" she added, \"the Biden administration's war on American energy is now reaching inside Americans' homes\" to what she called \"out-of-control appliance mandates.''\n\nRep. Katie Porter, D-California, said many Republicans who back the appliance measures don't even know how dishwashers work or how much they cost.\n\n\"I know a lot about dishwashers, because I'm a single mom and I load and unload and load and unload and rinse and buy detergent,'' Porter said.\n\nShe asked if Republican colleagues know how much it costs per month to run an average dishwasher. When no one replied, Porter answered her own question, saying typical costs are about $2 to $4 a month. \"In other words, about one-third of a frappuccino,'' she said.\n\nContrary to Republican claims that dishwashers often don't work correctly because of complicated federal rules, the most important factor to ensure clean dishes \"is loading it correctly,'' Porter said.\n\n\"This bill is ridiculous,'' she added. \"It is Congress at its worst. A bunch of people who haven't unloaded a dishwasher ever telling the American people ... what kind of dishwashers they should or should not be able to buy.''\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The refrigerator bill from Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, and the dishwasher bill from Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., would prevent the Energy Department from finalizing or enforcing standards that are \"not technologically feasible or economically justified.\"\n\nThe bills would also prevent the standards from being implemented unless they result in a \"significant conservation of energy,\" and the department determines they will not increase consumer costs.\n\nThe Energy Department finalized new standards for dishwashers in April and residential refrigerators in December, with compliance required later this decade. It said these standards will help lower Americans' utility bills while also helping to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that stem from these appliances' electricity usage.\n\nThe department has noted that the updated standards merely fulfill the requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to reflect changes in technology. But it has increasingly faced pushback from Republicans, who argue the efficiency changes are unworkable for manufacturers and would raise costs.\n\nRead more: https://rollcall.com/2024/07/09/house-to-vote-on-blocking-new-dishwasher-refrigerator-standards/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dishwasher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Langworthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Langworthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariannette_Miller-Meeks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mariannette Miller-Meeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_Call", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roll Call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation of energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_and_Conservation_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy Policy and Conservation Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717941", "eventUri": "eng-9717941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The legislation related to rules for refrigerators and freezers, led by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), passed the lower chamber in a 212-192 vote, with seven Democrats voting in favor. Another bill regulating efficiency standards for dishwashers, introduced by Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY), passed in a 214-192 vote.\n\nThe bills take aim at the Department of Energy's efforts to tighten efficiency standards for a range of appliances, which Republicans argue would raise costs for customers while limiting consumer choice. The efficiency standards, which were finalized by the DOE earlier this year and in the late months of 2023, were proposed to help scale back energy use, curb carbon pollution, and cut utility bills for households and businesses.\n\nThe White House issued statements of administrative policy opposing the two bills - but stopped short of issuing a veto threat.\n\n\"These bills add vague, red-herring provisions to the law that would add uncertainty to the implementation of these standards and create unnecessary hurdles for DOE in making future updates,\" the statement reads. \"For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes these bills.\"\n\nThe Department of Energy finalized rules for residential refrigerators and freezers in December, which will take effect in January 2029 or 2030, depending on the model of the appliance. The DOE also finalized efficiency standards for dishwashers in April, and compliance will be required starting in 2027.\n\nDuring floor remarks, Langworthy blasted the DOE rules as \"draconian,\" arguing the regulations \"make absolutely no sense from either an affordability or energy standpoint.\"\n\n\"Under this administration's latest proposed dishwasher efficiency standards rule, the average American family would be stuck with fewer, more expensive appliance options with no real cost savings over the appliances' lifespan,\" Langworthy said on Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats punched back, chastising Republicans as wasting time with messaging measures that are likely to stall in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\"I feel I need to remind the viewing audience that this is not Home Depot - this is supposed to be the United States Congress where we're supposed to be tackling serious issues that are confronting the American people,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), ranking member of the House Rules Committee. \"Unfortunately, under this Republican leadership, we never do that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group, sent a letter to members on Tuesday advocating for members to oppose the Republican-led appliance measures, arguing that the efficiency standards relieve stress on the grid and tight water supplies, while improving systems' reliability.\n\nIn September of last year, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, along with other industry and advocacy groups, announced their support for updating appliance standards, and released a set of recommended proposals for the DOE to adopt.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, and the dishwasher bill from Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., would prevent the Energy Department from finalizing or enforcing standards that are \"not technologically feasible or economically justified.\"\n\nThe bills would also prevent the standards from being implemented unless they result in a \"significant conservation of energy,\" and the department determines they will not increase consumer costs.\n\nThe Energy Department finalized new standards for dishwashers in April and residential refrigerators in December, with compliance required later this decade. It said these standards will help lower Americans' utility bills while also helping to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that stem from these appliances' electricity usage.\n\nThe department has noted that the updated standards merely fulfill the requirements of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to reflect changes in technology. But it has increasingly faced pushback from Republicans, who argue the efficiency changes are unworkable for manufacturers and would raise costs.\n\n\"These regulations only serve to increase prices for these essential home appliances, reduce consumer choices and impair their performance while claiming to fix a problem that does not exist,\" Miller-Meeks said when her bill was marked up by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March.\n\nHouse Republicans have passed similar bills before. In May the House passed a more sweeping bill that would require all energy efficiency standards to meet requirements such as a \"significant conservation of energy or water\" and allow the department to grant a petition to revoke or amend energy conservation standards if it finds they are not feasible with current technology.\n\nAnd in response to comments from a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, last year the House passed two bills that would prohibit the administration from finalizing any regulation prohibiting gas stoves.\n\nEach of these bills have passed with a small minority of Democrats joining the Republican majority. However, many Democrats, including Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have mocked the bills and questioned Republican priorities.\n\n\"This is what we are dealing with on this magical House floor, with all of the challenges the American people are confronting? Liberty for laundry? Defending the dignity of dishwashers?

Hot topics at the hearing included Title IX, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, and several other proposed bills aimed at standards for household appliances.\n\nThe Republican-led home appliance bills that were discussed at the committee hearing included H.R. 7700, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act, and H.R. 7637, the Refrigerator Freedom Act.\n\nThe Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act is aimed at preventing the Department of Energy from enforcing or updating new energy conservation standards for dishwashers, \"unless the standards are determined by the department to be technologically feasible,\" according to the Congressional Budget Office's summary of the bill.\n\n\"The bill would prohibit DOE from issuing, updating, or enforcing energy conservation standards for the affected appliances unless the standards are determined by the department to be technologically feasible, economically justified, unlikely to increase net costs for consumers, and to provide significant energy savings,\" CBO said.\n\nThe Refrigerator Freedom Act, which was originally introduced in March, would prevent the Secretary of Energy from rolling out similarly restrictive rules for refrigerators.\n\nMany House Republicans have expressed strong opinions on these energy conservation appliance rules in the past leading up to this hearing.\n\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, sponsored the bill for The Refrigerator Freedom Act, which was introduced in March.\n\n\"The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden Administration have done nothing but implement outrageous regulations that only serve to limit consumer choice, increase energy prices, and control everything Americans are able to do on a day-to-day basis,\" Miller-Meeks said in a press release when it was introduced. \"I'm proud that my bill passed the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I will continue to ensure American consumers have freedom to choose what type of appliances they want in their own home.\"\n\nOthers have praised the energy standards, expressing concerns about environmental harm.\n\nMore from this section PM Modi In Moscow: Members Of The Indian Diaspora Welcome And Greet The Indian Prime Minister AI-generated influencer Kenza Layli crowned world's first Miss AI Stay cool at the Jersey Shore when temps are sizzling hot\n\nOverall, though, costs to the average American remain at the center of the debate.\n\n\"These appliance regulations almost always hurt consumers because they take away consumer choices,\" Senior Fellow at Competitive Enterprise Institute Ben Lieberman told The Center Square. \"Keep in mind if you want to choose the ultra efficient dishwasher or air conditioner, that's always an option for you, but what these standards do is they force that option on everyone whether it makes sense for you or not.\n\n\"These appliance regulations tend to raise the upfront costs of these appliances, so if it's an appliance you plan on using sparingly, you may never earn back that higher upfront costs in the form of reduced energy savings over the life of the appliance,\" Lieberman said.\n\nThere remains a questions about costs, since rules can make appliances more expensive but also save consumers money at times by designing them to use less water or electrcity.\n\n\"Energy efficiency standards make the household products we use every day better and more efficient, while saving consumers money,\" Andrew deLaski, executive director of The Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a statement from May.\n\nSeveral Republicans criticized the current appliance efficiency standards during the Rules Committee hearing.\n\n\"So under this rule and based on what anyone who uses appliances regularly would know, most Americans will never see the savings laid out in the proposed rule,\" Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Penn, slammed the Republican's proposed household appliance bills during the hearing.\n\n\"I can't believe that we're here with refrigerator freedom and laundry liberty again, I mean, I thought we'd beaten this horse to death,\" Scanlon said during the hearing. \"It does seem after the Fourth of July that we can pledge allegiance to the fridge of the United States of America and to the dishwasher for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible except for gas stoves, with liberty and justice for all appliances.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

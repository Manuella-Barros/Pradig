Vance, who faced scrutiny for his 'childless ladies' remarks, described the situation on the Full Send podcast.\n\nOn July 15, just days after surviving an assassination attempt, Donald Trump appeared at the RNC to announce his running mate. The decision, reportedly made at the last minute, was shared by JD Vance, who recounted receiving the call from Trump while in a hotel room with his 7-year-old son, Ewan. Vance described receiving numerous warnings and messages during his flight, including a crucial notice from Trump's campaign to anticipate a \"really important call.\"\n\nAlso read: JD Vance's 'smokey' eyes get TikTok scan makeup tutorials, 'Does he wear eyeliner?'\n\nThe Ohio senator, along with his wife Usha Chilukuri Vance and their three children, aged 7, 4, and 2, flew to Milwaukee to attend the Republican National Convention. He shared that, although he knew he was a shortlisted candidate, he did not receive official confirmation until an hour later.\n\n\"I'm on the phone with Donald Trump,\" Vance told podcasters the Nelk Boys. \"I'm like, 'Son, shut the hell up for 30 seconds.'\" The senator told a story about how his son, who loves collecting Pok\u00e9mon cards, got super excited talking about Pikachu -- one of the biggest characters from the famous Japanese series -- while Vance was chatting with the ex-president on the phone.\n\nAlso read: Kamala Harris accidentally calls herself 'president' and the crowd's reaction is wild: Watch\n\n\"He is really into Pok\u00e9mon cards right now, he's going through a Pok\u00e9mon phase... I mean, he's really into it, so he is trying to talk to me about Pikachu, and I am on the phone with Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut, the next message from Trump's team wasn't about the big announcement, but it was definitely not good news, Vance says. He reportedly got a message from someone saying \"Hey, you just missed a really important call.\" The hillbilly Elegy author recalled returning a call to say, \"Hey Sir, what's going on?\" The ex-president reportedly told him, \"J.D., you missed a really important phone call, and now I'm going to have to go with someone else.\"\n\nVance mentioned that his son didn't mind Trump being on the phone because he \"doesn't get what the President of the United States is all about.\"\n\n\"It's the most important phone call of my life,\" Vance begged his kid \"Please just let me take this phone call.\" The clip of the podcast is now doing rounds on the internet, leading several critics to scrutinise the GOP vice-presidential nominee's parenting approach.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pikachu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pok\u00e9mon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/03/1600x900/Election-2024-Trump-92_1722267226639_1722647042424.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 475, "textEnd": 482}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The senator was publicly announced as the former president's running mate last month at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.\n\nHowever, as Vance recounted the phone call he had with Trump, he pointed out his 7-year old son had attempted to interrupt it.\n\n\"My son, who is seven, is in the hotel room with me,\" Vance told the political podcast, which regularly hosts conservatives. \"And he is really into Pok\u00e9mon cards right now. He's going through a Pok\u00e9mon phase...he's really into it. So he's trying to talk to me about Pikachu and I'm on the phone with Donald Trump and I'm like, 'Son, shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu,'\" Vance said. \"This is the most important phone call of my life. Please just let me take this phone call.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Vance's spokesperson and Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nVance's comments have since made their way to X, formerly Twitter, as some users took to the social media platform to criticize him.\n\nRepresentative Wiley Nickel, a North Carolina Democrat, wrote on X on Saturday, \"What a truly horrible human being...J.D. Vance tells his 7 year-old son to 'shut the hell up' because he's talking to Trump. I've got a simple rule in Congress. There's no call that's ever more important than my kids.\"\n\nChair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Jaime Harrison also took aim at Vance and shared the video of the podcast interview, which garnered 2 million views, and wrote on X, \"In what world do you tell a 7-year-old to 'shut the hell up?' And this weirdo 'sociopath' wants to talk about parenting?! Maybe he needs to shut the hell up!\"\n\nAfter Friday's podcast aired, the DNC wrote in a statement on its website, \"If there's one thing JD Vance is going to do, it's full send being the weirdest, creepiest, and most unpopular running mate Donald Trump could have ever hoped for.\"\n\nDemocratic influencer Harry Sisson wrote on X, \"JD Vance is genuinely so weird. While on the phone with Trump, he told his son to 'Shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu.' Sheesh. And announcing this to the world? Real stellar parenting here...\"\n\nHowever, others on X pointed toward Vance's comments as \"pretty normal.\"\n\nSenior political reporter for Business Insider Bryan Metzger shared the video and wrote, \"If you watch/listen it's pretty normal.\"\n\nX user Elaine wrote: \"Great casual discussion. The more I learn about Vance, the more I like him.\"\n\nVance's latest comments come after Democrats have taken aim at the Republican labeling him \"weird and creepy\" following resurfaced remarks he made saying the United States is run by \"childless cat ladies\" during an interview with Fox News in 2021 while running for U.S. Senate, pointing to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee who began her bid for the White House after President Joe Biden stepped down from the 2024 race on July 21, as an example.\n\nHowever, Vance has continued to defend himself amid the backlash. Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said in a previous statement to Newsweek, \"Once again, the leftwing media have twisted Senator Vance's words and spun up a false narrative about his position on the issues. The Democrats are in complete disarray with the most unpopular Vice President in history as their party's nominee. The only childlessness we should be talking about are the childless parents who lost their kids to the murderous thugs and deadly fentanyl coming across Kamala's southern border.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as David B. Cohen, professor of political science at the University of Akron in Ohio, recently warned that Vance's attempts to backtrack on those remarks might be harming his popularity, and by extension, the Trump campaign.\n\n\"While attacks on women who don't have biological children -- be that by choice or because of medical reasons -- may go over well with most of the MAGA base, it's offensive to many other Americans, including independents and disaffected Republicans -- voters the Trump campaign desperately needs in order to win the crucial battleground states,\" Cohen told previously Newsweek.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_Nickel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wiley Nickel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Please just let me take this phone call.'\"\n\nVance has been married to wife Usha since 2014 and the couple have three children, two-year-old Mirabel, four-year-old Vivek and seven-year-old Ewan.\n\nVance's latest comments come after a flurry of Democratic attacks that have labeled him \"weird and creepy.\" A video resurfaced from 2021 of Vance referring to women who have not given birth as \"childless cat ladies\" who \"want to make the country miserable\". There has been strong pushback including from Jennifer Aniston and Kerstin Emhoff, tex-wife of Kamala Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nIn 2021, Vance also said parents should have \"more power\" when voting. The senator has also said that declining birth rates are a \"civilizational crisis\" driven by a \"childless left.\" A year later, Vance called for a nationwide ban on abortion.\n\nThe senator has the lowest polling of any GOP vice presidential candidate immediately following the RNC since the 1980s, The Independent previously reported.

And now that Vice President Kamala Harris has officially selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate, he'll go up against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump's named no. 2.\n\nWalz enters the national ring weeks after Vance was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention, where the GOP touted the millennial senator's conservative credentials and ties to a pivotal Midwest state.\n\nStill, Vance has faced some criticism in recent weeks. The junior senator recently came under fire for comments about Americans without biological children - a demographic that includes Harris - referring to them as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America, in a 2021 interview with Fox News.\n\nVance's controversy, coupled with rising excitement over Harris' jump to the top of the ticket, has given Democrats a boost less than 100 days to Election Day.\n\nBut how long will that boost last? Harris tapping Walz sets the stage for a contentious match-up between the experienced Midwestern governor and fresh-faced senator with a few years in Washington.\n\nSo how does Walz stack up to Vance?\n\nOn a slew of issues, Walz and Vance are generally aligned with their running mates - and distinct from one another.\n\nVance has been an outspoken opponent of abortion - an issue expected to play a key role in 2024 - but backed Trump's public position of leaving decisions around restrictions to individual states. However, the senator has said previously he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\"\n\nWalz is more in lockstep with Harris, as an equally vocal supporter of reproductive rights on the campaign trail. And the same dynamic plays out between Trump and Vance - and Harris and Walz - on issues ranging from climate change to immigration and more.\n\nAcross the board, though, Vance in recent years has doubled down on Trump's stances. His position as a MAGA-megaphone made Vance a more unusual choice, said Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It wasn't a pick that seemed to reach out to a different sector of the Republican Party, or to unify the party or the country,\" Goldstein told USA TODAY. \"It seemed that Senator Vance was, of all the candidates, the one who had gone to the greatest lengths to associate himself with former President Trump.\"\n\nHarris picking Walz also doesn't necessarily represent bringing together differing Democrats.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nBut what else do Walz and Vance bring to the table? Originally added to the GOP ticket to attract swing state voters and face a former senator from California - before Biden bowed out of the 2024 race - Vance may have a different fight against Walz, a two-term governor with years in politics under his belt.\n\nNow, Vance isn't the only Midwesterner in the game. In naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states, and beyond.\n\nWalz, 60, has also been governor of Minnesota - a decades-long Democratic stronghold - since 2018, coming off 12 years of representing the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Walz also served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nTrump's pick, meanwhile, lacks the experience of a typical vice president, Goldstein said.\n\nVance, a 40 year old who previously served in the Marines, made his introduction to politics two years ago after rising to fame with his best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his 2022 Senate campaign, he faced a competitive Republican primary and was ultimately boosted by a coveted Trump endorsement.\n\nBut in a presidential election, experience isn't everything, Goldstein cautioned. After all, concerns about Biden and Trump's ages have taken center stage for months.\n\n\"The fact that you have X years of experience doesn't mean that you're ready,\" he said, \"and the fact that you have very little doesn't mean that you're not ready for the national stage.\"\n\nBut Vance's greenness may already be taking its toll.\n\nJust under 30% of voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Buckeye State lawmaker, a historic low for a potential vice president, in a CNN/SSRS poll published July 24.\n\nTrump defends Vance: The former president responded to backlash over 'childless cat ladies' comment\n\n\"In Vance's case, you don't really have any sort of other indication that he's ready,\" Goldstein said. \"So then when he gets out on the national stage, and is confronted with damaging clips from his past, and isn't very effective in handling them, it sort of reinforces questions about his inexperience.\"\n\nWalz's experience hasn't guaranteed name recognition though, a challenge he'll have to take on ahead of November. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they've never heard of Walz or were unsure how to rate him in a NPR/PBS/Marist national survey released this week.\n\nRegardless of their resumes and approaches, in the coming months, Vance and Walz will face a similar challenge. They'll have to make their pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job.\n\nThe country got a taste ofVance's willingness to vehemently defend his running mate and go after their opposition during his speech at the RNC accepting his VP nomination. Vance told the nation that Americans \"need\" Trumpat this moment in history and bashed Biden and Harris' leadership.\n\nWalz will have the same opportunity as he takes up the running mate mantle ahead of the Democratic convention later this month.\n\nBut political observers have already seen a slice of how he'll go on offense. When he was simply a vice presidential candidate, Walz coined a new Democratic talking point, bashing Vance and Trump on TV and social media with a now-viral insult against his GOP opponents, labeling them \"weird.\"\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz told MSNBC. \"They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

JD Vance of Ohio, Donald Trump's running mate, is traveling to Philadelphia Tuesday for the first time since he became the GOP vice presidential nominee last month.\n\nVance has had a rocky start to the campaign, dogged by past comments critical of women with no children - \"childless cat ladies,\" as he described them - and of Trump, whom he previously referred to as a \"moral disaster\" and \"reprehensible.\" The Hillbilly Elegy author switched his position on Trump during his Senate run and has apologized for his previous remarks about him, telling Fox News in 2021, \"I regret being wrong about the guy.\"\n\n\"I've always had great respect for him and for the other candidates, too,\" Trump said of Vance during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists last week. \"Historically, the choice of the vice president makes no difference. You're voting for the president. And you can have a vice president who's outstanding in every way - and I think JD is, I think that all of them would have been - but you're not voting that way, you're voting for the president.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's running mate during the 2016 and 2020 elections, isn't supporting the former president after having refused to go along with a plan to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nVance's comments will come just hours before Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to attend rally at the Liacouras Center at Temple University Tuesday evening, where she's expected to speak around 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhat time is JD Vance speaking in Philadelphia?\n\nVance is attending an event at the 2300 Arena on South Swanson Street in South Philly. The entertainment venue, which often hosts wrestling, boxing, and MMA events, seats about 2,000 people.\n\nDoors are scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m., with Vance slated to speak at noon, according to the Trump campaign.\n\nWill there be any road closures on I-95 or elsewhere?\n\nWhile the Secret Service doesn't provide the routes for obvious reasons, there will likely be rolling closures on I-95 Tuesday as Vance travels between the airport and South Philly.\n\nPolice said drivers can expect delays and closures in the immediate vicinity surrounding Vance's event in South Philadelphia, but his visit isn't expected to disrupt traffic too much.\n\nVance touring same states as Harris this week\n\nPhiladelphia won't be the only city where Vance and Harris appear on the same day.\n\nAccording to Politico, Vance is planning to trail Harris and her campaign across several battleground states this week. On Wednesday he'll follow Harris to Detroit and Eau Claire, Wis., followed by a trip to Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday.\n\nWill JD Vance debate Kamala Harris' running mate?\n\nThat remains unclear, especially with Harris still mulling over potential running mates.\n\nA vice presidential debate had been scheduled to take place at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Sept. 25, but the event was canceled.\n\nThere might not be another presidential debate, either. Trump backed out of a debate on ABC that, prior to Joe Biden dropping out of the race, had been scheduled for Sept. 10. In its place, Trump proposed a debate on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania that would involve a live audience.\n\n\"I'll be there on September 10, like he agreed to,\" Harris wrote on social media. \"I hope to see him there.\"\n\nWhen is Donald Trump's next rally?\n\nTrump's public schedule is pretty empty this week.\n\nThe former president's next rally is scheduled to take place Friday in Bozeman, Mont., with Trump scheduled to speak at 10 p.m. Eastern (8 p.m. local time).\n\nTrump won Montana by 16 percentage points in 2020, but his visit is aimed at boosting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Jon Tester. Trump made four stops in Montana in 2018 to campaign for Rep. Matt Rosendale, who lost to Tester by 3.5 percentage points, or about 17,000 votes.\n\nStaff writer Julia Terruso contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType":

JD Vance, the GOP vice-presidential nominee, has his way, Harris' time in the spotlight with her vice presidential pick won't be an easy experience.\n\nVance plans to follow Harris for three days and across four swing states as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns with her running mate, according to Politico. The rollout is especially important for Harris as she became the party's standard-bearer less than a month ago following President Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race.\n\nThe Ohioan is set to trail Harris in Philadelphia; Detroit; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Raleigh, North Carolina. And while Vance won't be headlining rallies, he'll be holding media appearances in the cities alongside voters critical of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nAt first glance, Vance's trip may not seem like a high-stakes effort.\n\nBut it's a gamble.\n\nIn recent months, former President Donald Trump had been leading Biden in most major national polls. And Vance's vice presidential selection was seemingly aimed not at drawing in swing voters -- who had been souring on Biden -- but on firming up the Republican base.\n\nBut Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris' ability to quickly rally the party around her caught the GOP by surprise. And it sapped any real bump that could have resulted from last month's Republican National Convention.\n\nIn recent days, Harris and Trump have been locked in a close race in national and swing-state polls, with the vice president pulling ahead in some of the surveys.\n\nEnter Vance, who wants to halt any sort of sustained momentum for Harris as she stumps with her eventual vice presidential pick.\n\nWhen Harris appears in key battlegrounds this week, Vance will be there to attack the Democratic ticket on local news and bring out conservative voters to sharpen criticism of Biden's record on issues like the economy and immigration. The senator is seemingly aiming to get ahead of the news cycle to blunt a potential Democratic vice presidential honeymoon period.\n\nSince joining the GOP ticket last month, Vance's rollout has been a rocky one.\n\nVance already had a national profile due to his best-selling 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" But before Vance was elected to office in 2022, he made a raft of controversial statements, and during one notable interview, he deemed some Democratic Party leaders to be \"childless cat ladies\" who didn't have a stake in the country's future.\n\nVance's past remarks and MAGA-aligned views on issues like Ukraine (he opposes US funding for the conflict) haven't been a hit with voters. He boasted a minus-5-point favorability rating after the GOP convention. Last month, CNN reported that Vance had a double-digit unfavorable rating with voters in a group of Midwestern states that included his native Ohio.\n\nSo Vance's plan to lay into Harris and her running mate will be a tricky balancing act. He doesn't have the highest standing with voters right now, and if Harris taps either Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she'll have an executive by her side with real appeal among working-class voters.\n\nVance will be looking to draw attention to the GOP ticket when Americans will naturally want to learn more about Harris' running mate.\n\nIt'll be a huge fight for attention during a time when Harris could receive another polling bump based on the selection.\n\nRepublicans have sought to depict Harris as too liberal for the country and have pointed to her San Francisco Bay Area roots to make their case.\n\nBut that argument thus far has not proven to be effective with voters.\n\nA vice presidential pick like Shapiro or Walz -- who are both seen as mainstream Democratic choices -- could throw cold water on some of the attacks over Harris' ideology.\n\nVance will surely hammer Harris over her past support for more liberal proposals on healthcare during her 2020 presidential campaign. But Harris now has a record as part of the administration, and she can point to populist achievements like capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for many Americans on Medicare.\n\nSome voters will applaud Vance's shadow tour of Harris' vice presidential rollout, while others will view it as a stunt. Either way, Vance's itinerary shows that Democrats have all the momentum right now, and Republicans are doing whatever they can to stop it.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

And now that Vice President Kamala Harris has officially selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate, he'll go up against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump's named no. 2.\n\nWalz enters the national ring weeks after Vance was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention, where the GOP touted the millennial senator's conservative credentials and ties to a pivotal Midwest state.\n\nStill, Vance has faced some criticism in recent weeks. The junior senator recently came under fire for comments about Americans without biological children - a demographic that includes Harris - referring to them as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America, in a 2021 interview with Fox News.\n\n'A quip': Usha Vance, JD Vance's wife, defends his 'childless cat ladies' comments\n\nVance's controversy, coupled with rising excitement over Harris' jump to the top of the ticket, has given Democrats a boost less than 100 days to Election Day.\n\nBut how long will that boost last? Harris tapping Walz sets the stage for a contentious match-up between the experienced Midwestern governor and fresh-faced senator with a few years in Washington.\n\nSo how does Walz stack up to Vance?\n\nOn a slew of issues, Walz and Vance are generally aligned with their running mates - and distinct from one another.\n\nVance has been an outspoken opponent of abortion - an issue expected to play a key role in 2024 - but backed Trump's public position of leaving decisions around restrictions to individual states. However, the senator has said previously he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\"\n\nWalz is more in lockstep with Harris, as an equally vocal supporter of reproductive rights on the campaign trail. And the same dynamic plays out between Trump and Vance - and Harris and Walz - on issues ranging from climate change to immigration and more.\n\nAcross the board, though, Vance in recent years has doubled down on Trump's stances. His position as a MAGA-megaphone made Vance a more unusual choice, said Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It wasn't a pick that seemed to reach out to a different sector of the Republican Party, or to unify the party or the country,\" Goldstein told USA TODAY. \"It seemed that Senator Vance was, of all the candidates, the one who had gone to the greatest lengths to associate himself with former President Trump.\"\n\nHarris picking Walz also doesn't necessarily represent bringing together differing Democrats.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nBut what else do Walz and Vance bring to the table? Originally added to the GOP ticket to attract swing state voters and face a former senator from California - before Biden bowed out of the 2024 race - Vance may have a different fight against Walz, a two-term governor with years in politics under his belt.\n\nNow, Vance isn't the only Midwesterner in the game. In naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states, and beyond.\n\nWalz, 60, has also been governor of Minnesota - a decades-long Democratic stronghold - since 2018, coming off 12 years of representing the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Walz also served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nTrump's pick, meanwhile, lacks the experience of a typical vice president, Goldstein said.\n\nVance, a 40 year old who previously served in the Marines, made his introduction to politics two years ago after rising to fame with his best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his 2022 Senate campaign, he faced a competitive Republican primary and was ultimately boosted by a coveted Trump endorsement.\n\nBut in a presidential election, experience isn't everything, Goldstein cautioned. After all, concerns about Biden and Trump's ages have taken center stage for months.\n\n\"The fact that you have X years of experience doesn't mean that you're ready,\" he said, \"and the fact that you have very little doesn't mean that you're not ready for the national stage.\"\n\nBut Vance's greenness may already be taking its toll.\n\nJust under 30% of voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Buckeye State lawmaker, a historic low for a potential vice president, in a CNN/SSRS poll published July 24.\n\nTrump defends Vance: The former president responded to backlash over 'childless cat ladies' comment\n\n\"In Vance's case, you don't really have any sort of other indication that he's ready,\" Goldstein said. \"So then when he gets out on the national stage, and is confronted with damaging clips from his past, and isn't very effective in handling them, it sort of reinforces questions about his inexperience.\"\n\nWalz's experience hasn't guaranteed name recognition though, a challenge he'll have to take on ahead of November. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they've never heard of Walz or were unsure how to rate him in a NPR/PBS/Marist national survey released this week.\n\nRegardless of their resumes and approaches, in the coming months, Vance and Walz will face a similar challenge. They'll have to make their pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job.\n\nThe country got a taste of Vance's willingness to vehemently defend his running mate and go after their opposition during his speech at the RNC accepting his VP nomination. Vance told the nation that Americans \"need\" Trump at this moment in history and bashed Biden and Harris' leadership.\n\nWalz will have the same opportunity as he takes up the running mate mantle ahead of the Democratic convention later this month.\n\nBut political observers have already seen a slice of how he'll go on offense. When he was simply a vice presidential candidate, Walz coined a new Democratic talking point, bashing Vance and Trump on TV and social media with a now-viral insult against his GOP opponents, labeling them \"weird.\"\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz told MSNBC. \"They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Walz vs. Vance: How Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's VP picks match up", "source": {"uri":

Now Vice President Kamala Harrishas tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate to take on Republican Donald Trump and his No. 2, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nAs different as they are, Walz and Vance both qualify as picks meant to reassure their party's loyal base voters rather than adding homegrown heft in a critical battleground state.\n\nThe two No. 2s will also get a chance to square off in almost real time as Walz is traveling this week with Harris to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, while Vance will follow an overlapping itinerary to offer his own counterprograming in some places.\n\nSome takeaways on the race now that Harris has settled on Walz:\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party's left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters. Some in Harris' inner circle saw Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Walz's ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Trump.\n\nNeither vice presidential pick seems to do much to build out his party's coalition -- a sign that both campaigns view this election as about boosting turnout from their existing bases.\n\nJust as Walz hails from the solidly Democratic state of Minnesota, Vance comes from the safely Republican state of Ohio. There is a bet that each choice can radiate Midwestern appeal to the key \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin simply by dint of geographical proximity.\n\nHarris allies have stressed Walz's ability to appeal to rural voters, although his 2022 reelection as governor roughly matched the margins of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win in Minnesota. Trump won 6 in 10 rural and small town voters nationwide in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nThe Trump campaign was quick to try to connect Walz to its characterizations of Harris as a California liberal, saying his support for gun control and teachers unions make him a \"West Coast wannabe.\"\n\nVance, for his part, comes from a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 percentage points. Just like the former president with his book \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" Vance achieved national recognition with his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Vance has mainly played to cultural and policy issues favored by strict adherents of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement such as cutting military support for Ukraine.\n\nVance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Harris and Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His role is to attack the Biden administration's policies and tear down Harris' record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nVance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally. He said during his Philadelphia stop that \"I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\" but not until after the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris' team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nWalz's selection settled one big question mark among Democrats, but plenty of major challenges remain for the final months of a race already defined by its unexpected twists and turns.\n\nThere is the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East, the possibility of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve that might calm global financial markets and questions about whether Trump and Harris will actually square off in a September debate that was set before Biden bowed out of the race.\n\nNo matter what happens, the conventional narratives of a presidential campaign have already had seemingly brief shelf lives. Voters over the past few weeks have dealt with Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, a brazen assassination attempt on Trump, Biden's exit from the race and Harris' quick ascendance among Democrats.\n\nNow that both tickets are settled, a reckoning will take place over positions, and small differences can matter to voters who on the margin could decide a narrow election. Global events can upend talking points in ways that are hard to predict. The 2008 campaign intensified with that year's financial crisis, while the persistence of the coronavirus shaped 2020.\n\nIf there are any lessons from this year, it's that election year surprises are no longer reserved for October.\n\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

JD Vance, of Ohio, made his first campaign stop in Pennsylvania since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate. Vance's visit was eclipsed by the breaking news that his Democratic counterpart in the 2024 presidential race is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nVance's speech attacked the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, and her record as U.S. Vice President, particularly on immigration and border control.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has been such a disastrous vice president of this country that everywhere she goes, chaos and uncertainty follow,\" he said.\n\nVance's rally was held shortly after noon at the 2300 Arena in South Philadelphia, and drew a crowd of more than 200 supporters.\n\n\"I think Vance was a great pick,\" Kate Collins, chair of the Downingtown Republican Committee said. \"He is the definition of the American dream. If you work hard, you can do anything, including maybe one day being president.\"\n\nVance started his speech by emphasizing the need for stronger borders and what he called the failures of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"We know that every time Kamala Harris took an action to open the American southern border, it is families like many who stand behind me today who have suffered the most,\" he said.\n\nVance shared the stage with local residents affected by issues like the opioid crisis and crime, including Geraldine Briggs from Philadelphia.\n\n\"Democrats claim to have cleaned up the streets, but it has not worked,\" said Briggs, whose brother struggles with opioid addiction. \"The border crisis has led to an influx of drugs coming across the border and impacting families like mine throughout the city.\"\n\nVance shared some of his personal story portrayed in the 2016 book Hillbilly Elegy, talking about how his own mother's battle with opioid addiction affected him as a child growing up in Middletown, Ohio. The book was later adapted into a major motion picture.\n\n\"It's my mother's favorite book, one of her favorite movies,\" said Jaden Gdowick, a senior at Temple University and South Philly resident. \"I grew up without a father. We don't have a lot of money coming in right now. So having Trump pick him as a running mate, I really resonated with him.\"\n\nVance's short time on the campaign trail has been rocky, including comments comparing prominent Democrats to \"childless cat ladies\" drawing criticism.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question about the comment, a person in the crowd yelled, \"This cat lady loves you!\" Vance responded, \"I love you too, ma'am,\" and defended his remarks.\n\n\"What I said is very simple, I think American families are good, and government policy should be more pro-family,\" he said. \"Now, if the media wants to get offended about a sarcastic remark I made before I even ran for the United States Senate, then the media is entitled to get offended. You know what I'm offended by? I'm offended that normal Americans can't afford grocery prices.\"\n\nJim Worthington, chair of the Republican state delegation to the Republican National Convention, said that this campaign event was a chance for voters to really get to know Vance.\n\n\"The more people get to see him, the more they'll love him,\" Worthington said. \"Unfortunately, the Democrats and the media tried to paint him as some kind of odd person. I mean, he's the all-American boy with the all-American story, so they're going to love him.\"\n\nHeather Cabuano, 44, from South Philadelphia, said the voters need to focus less on comments Vance and Trump have made and look instead at their policies.\n\n\"I mean, OK, so Trump called a woman something. I'm a woman. I'm not offended by it,\" she said. \"People say things all the time. It's who's going to run the country and who's going to do a good job at it.\"\n\nVance's Philly appearance comes before Harris' rally at Temple University's Liacouras Center -- her first with her new running mate.\n\nBefore the doors opened for Vance's rally, news broke that Walz was Harris' VP pick. She also considered Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona.\n\nWorthington called Harris' choice of Walz over Shapiro \"Christmas in August.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Kamala Harris, for shunning Josh Shapiro, a guy that would be more moderate, represents the Jewish constituency in our country, and showing that she doesn't really care about Jewish people and the plight they're going through,\" he said. \"It's certainly going to make our job in Pennsylvania a lot easier when I have to talk to Jewish people about why they need to vote for Trump and Vance, versus Harris.\"\n\nWorthington said momentum for Trump has been building in Bucks County -- which recently flipped majority Republican in voter registrations -- and beyond.\n\n\"Bucks County and the Southeast is going to decide who the next president of the United States is, and now with her pick this morning ... she made it more apparent that it's going to be do-or-die in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nTrump has recently come under criticism for questioning Harris' race during a panel last week at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention in Chicago.\n\nWalz has been on the campaign trail supporting Harris and has been among the politicians who have labeled Trump, Vance and other Republicans as \"weird.\"\n\nAttendees at the Vance rally took exception to the characterization. \"They want to call JD Vance weird?\" said Cathy Collins. \"Have they looked at what's in the cabinet at the White House?\"\n\nVance said Walz is \"one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government.\"\n\n\"I think that what Tim Walz's selection says is Kamala Harris has bent the knee to the far left of her party, which is what she always does,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

JD Vance argued that Vice President Kamala Harris had bowed to her party's left wing in choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\n\"When given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party, that's exactly what she did here,\" Vance told a crowd of Trump supporters Tuesday at the 2300 Arena in South Philly.\n\nThe Ohio Republican doubled down on comments he had made earlier in the day, insisting that antisemitism would be the cause if Shapiro was not Harris' VP pick. Shapiro, the state's third Jewish governor, had faced opposition from pro-Palestinian progressives over his full-throated support for Israel.\n\n\"I genuinely feel bad that for days, maybe weeks, the guy actually had to run away from his Jewish heritage because of what the Democrats are saying about him, I think that's scandalous and disgraceful,\" Vance said.\n\nContrary to Vance's claims, Shapiro at no point downplayed his Jewish heritage during the vetting process.\n\nIn addition to his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza, Shapiro faced scrutiny over his support for private school vouchers and his handling of sexual harassment allegations against a top aide.\n\nVance's event came hours after Harris announced she'd picked Walz as her running mate, passing over Shapiro, who many Pennsylvania Democrats had hoped would snag the job. Harris is set to hold a rally at Temple University's Liacouras Center to introduce Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nVance pledged to debate Walz, but only after the Minnesota governor was officially named the vice presidential nominee by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn an unusual format for a rally, Vance invited Pennsylvanians who had been affected by crime and the opioid crisis to the stage. He then took questions from members of the media who attended the event. Most of the questions focused around Harris' running mate.\n\nRabbi Beth Janus, co-president of the Board of Rabbis of Greater Philadelphia who had hoped Shapiro would be chosen, said Vance is attempting to use antisemitism in the Democratic Party as a \"wedge issue.\" The rabbi argued Vance should also look at his own party.\n\n\"We have seen an extreme amount of antisemitism in the Republican Party, the embracing of white nationalists is extremely troubling,\" Janus said.\n\nSeveral Jewish Democratic organizations have come out in support of Walz as the VP pick since the news broke Tuesday morning.\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. She has also supported Israel as a senator and vice president -- though she has called for a cease-fire.\n\nMark Laino, a lifelong Republican and a watchmaker who lives a few blocks from the arena, said the high-intensity vetting Shapiro underwent in recent weeks felt excessively focused on his Jewish identity and his pro-Israel politics.\n\nSimilar to Vance, he said Harris' decision felt tinged with antisemitism.\n\n\"I think that's very wrong,\" Laino said. \"How else can you explain it? You take his stance on Israel and I think she was afraid of the backlash.\"\n\nWhile Shapiro had been viewed as a running mate that could appeal to Pennsylvania and moderates, Vance framed Walz as too liberal -- pointing to his energy policies and response to protests in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd in 2020.\n\n\"He is the double-down choice for failed leadership,\" he said. \"Kamala Harris selected him, I don't know why, but I think it's because she's fundamentally a radical herself and she wanted a partner in crime.\"\n\nMaureen Fratantoni, a 64-year-old Philadelphia resident who voted for Trump for the first time in 2020, said she had heard bad things about Walz.\n\n\"He'll unleash hell, whatever that means,\" Fratantoni said before Vance took the stage.\n\nSince Harris became the likely Democratic nominee the campaign has been focused intensely on a message portraying Vance and Trump as \"weird\" and \"creeps.\" Walz was one of the first to adopt that language, calling Trump and Vance \"just weird\" in an MSNBC interview last month that went viral.\n\nDemocrats have narrowed in on Vance's hard-line anti-abortion stance and his statements criticizing childless Americans, especially women. After a reporter asked Vance a question about his now infamous 2021 remark that Harris and other top Democrats are \"childless cat ladies,\" one event attendee yelled out \"this cat lady loves you.\"\n\nVance, meanwhile, attacked the media for focusing on the comments.\n\n\"What I said is very simple, I think American families are good and government policy should be more pro-family. Now, if the media wants to get offended about a sarcastic remark I made before I even ran for the United States Senate, then the media is entitled to get offended,\" Vance said before adding that he was offended by grocery costs and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nBurt Dejong, a 72-year-old rallygoer, dismissed the Democratic messaging and said he was instead focused on immigration and inflation.\n\n\"Personalities are what you vote on in high school,\" said the retired U.S. Coast Guard officer from New Jersey. \"Policy is real-world stuff that adults have to vote on.\"", "source":

JD Vance argued that Vice President Kamala Harris had bowed to her party's left wing in choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\n\"When given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party, that's exactly what she did here,\" Vance told a crowd of Trump supporters Tuesday at the 2300 Arena in South Philly.\n\nThe Ohio Republican doubled down on comments he had made earlier in the day, insisting that antisemitism would be the cause if Shapiro was not Harris' VP pick. Shapiro, the state's third Jewish governor, had faced opposition from pro-Palestinian progressives over his full-throated support for Israel.\n\n\"I genuinely feel bad that for days, maybe weeks, the guy actually had to run away from his Jewish heritage because of what the Democrats are saying about him, I think that's scandalous and disgraceful,\" Vance said.\n\nContrary to Vance's claims, Shapiro at no point downplayed his Jewish heritage during the vetting process.\n\nIn addition to his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza, Shapiro faced scrutiny over his support for private school vouchers and his handling of sexual harassment allegations against a top aide.\n\nVance's event came hours after Harris announced she'd picked Walz as her running mate, passing over Shapiro, who many Pennsylvania Democrats had hoped would snag the job. Harris is set to hold a rally at Temple University's Liacouras Center to introduce Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nVance pledged to debate Walz, but only after the Minnesota governor was officially named the vice presidential nominee by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn an unusual format for a rally, Vance invited Pennsylvanians who had been affected by crime and the opioid crisis to the stage. He then took questions from members of the media who attended the event. Most of the questions focused around Harris' running mate.\n\nRabbi Beth Janus, co-president of the Board of Rabbis of Greater Philadelphia who had hoped Shapiro would be chosen, said Vance is attempting to use antisemitism in the Democratic Party as a \"wedge issue.\" The rabbi argued Vance should also look at his own party.\n\n\"We have seen an extreme amount of antisemitism in the Republican Party, the embracing of white nationalists is extremely troubling,\" Janus said.\n\nSeveral Jewish Democratic organizations have come out in support of Walz as the VP pick since the news broke Tuesday morning.\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. She has also supported Israel as a senator and vice president -- though she has called for a cease-fire.\n\nMark Laino, a lifelong Republican and a watchmaker who lives a few blocks from the arena, said the high-intensity vetting Shapiro underwent in recent weeks felt excessively focused on his Jewish identity and his pro-Israel politics.\n\nSimilar to Vance, he said Harris' decision felt tinged with antisemitism.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I think that's very wrong,\" Laino said. \"How else can you explain it? You take his stance on Israel and I think she was afraid of the backlash.\"\n\nWhile Shapiro had been viewed as a running mate that could appeal to Pennsylvania and moderates, Vance framed Walz as too liberal -- pointing to his energy policies and response to protests in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd in 2020.\n\n\"He is the double-down choice for failed leadership,\" he said. \"Kamala Harris selected him, I don't know why, but I think it's because she's fundamentally a radical herself and she wanted a partner in crime.\"\n\nMaureen Fratantoni, a 64-year-old Philadelphia resident who voted for Trump for the first time in 2020, said she had heard bad things about Walz.\n\n\"He'll unleash hell, whatever that means,\" Fratantoni said before Vance took the stage.\n\nSince Harris became the likely Democratic nominee the campaign has been focused intensely on a message portraying Vance and Trump as \"weird\" and \"creeps.\" Walz was one of the first to adopt that language, calling Trump and Vance \"just weird\" in an MSNBC interview last month that went viral.\n\nDemocrats have narrowed in on Vance's hard-line anti-abortion stance and his statements criticizing childless Americans, especially women. After a reporter asked Vance a question about his now infamous 2021 remark that Harris and other top Democrats are \"childless cat ladies,\" one event attendee yelled out \"this cat lady loves you.\"\n\nVance, meanwhile, attacked the media for focusing on the comments.\n\n\"What I said is very simple, I think American families are good and government policy should be more pro-family. Now, if the media wants to get offended about a sarcastic remark I made before I even ran for the United States Senate, then the media is entitled to get offended,\" Vance said before adding that he was offended by grocery costs and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nBurt Dejong, a 72-year-old rallygoer, dismissed the Democratic messaging and said he was instead focused on immigration and inflation.\n\n\"Personalities are what you vote on in high school,\" said the retired U.S. Coast Guard officer from New Jersey. \"Policy is real-world stuff that adults have to vote on.\"\n\n(Staff writer Fallon Roth contributed to this article.)\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer.

And now that Vice President Kamala Harris has officially selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her 2024 running mate, he'll go up against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump's named no. 2.\n\nWalz enters the national ring weeks after Vance was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention, where the GOP touted the millennial senator's conservative credentials and ties to a pivotal Midwest state.\n\nStill, Vance has faced some criticism in recent weeks. The junior senator recently came under fire for comments about Americans without biological children - a demographic that includes Harris - referring to them as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America, in a 2021 interview with Fox News.\n\n'A quip': Usha Vance, JD Vance's wife, defends his 'childless cat ladies' comments\n\nVance's controversy, coupled with rising excitement over Harris' jump to the top of the ticket, has given Democrats a boost less than 100 days to Election Day.\n\nBut how long will that boost last? Harris tapping Walz sets the stage for a contentious match-up between the experienced Midwestern governor and fresh-faced senator with a few years in Washington.\n\nSo how does Walz stack up to Vance?\n\nOn a slew of issues, Walz and Vance are generally aligned with their running mates - and distinct from one another.\n\nVance has been an outspoken opponent of abortion - an issue expected to play a key role in 2024 - but backed Trump's public position of leaving decisions around restrictions to individual states. However, the senator has said previously he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\"\n\nWalz is more in lockstep with Harris, as an equally vocal supporter of reproductive rights on the campaign trail. And the same dynamic plays out between Trump and Vance - and Harris and Walz - on issues ranging from climate change to immigration and more.\n\nAcross the board, though, Vance in recent years has doubled down on Trump's stances. His position as a MAGA-megaphone made Vance a more unusual choice, said Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It wasn't a pick that seemed to reach out to a different sector of the Republican Party, or to unify the party or the country,\" Goldstein told USA TODAY. \"It seemed that Senator Vance was, of all the candidates, the one who had gone to the greatest lengths to associate himself with former President Trump.\"\n\nKeeping up with election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for everything you need to know.\n\nHarris picking Walz also doesn't necessarily represent bringing together differing Democrats.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nBut what else do Walz and Vance bring to the table? Originally added to the GOP ticket to attract swing state voters and face a former senator from California - before Biden bowed out of the 2024 race - Vance may have a different fight against Walz, a two-term governor with years in politics under his belt.\n\nNow, Vance isn't the only Midwesterner in the game. In naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states, and beyond.\n\nWalz, 60, has also been governor of Minnesota - a decades-long Democratic stronghold - since 2018, coming off 12 years of representing the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Walz also served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nTrump's pick, meanwhile, lacks the experience of a typical vice president, Goldstein said.\n\nVance, a 40 year old who previously served in the Marines, made his introduction to politics two years ago after rising to fame with his best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his 2022 Senate campaign, he faced a competitive Republican primary and was ultimately boosted by a coveted Trump endorsement.\n\nBut in a presidential election, experience isn't everything, Goldstein cautioned. After all, concerns about Biden and Trump's ages have taken center stage for months.\n\n\"The fact that you have X years of experience doesn't mean that you're ready,\" he said, \"and the fact that you have very little doesn't mean that you're not ready for the national stage.\"\n\nBut Vance's greenness may already be taking its toll.\n\nJust under 30% of voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Buckeye State lawmaker, a historic low for a potential vice president, in a CNN/SSRS poll published July 24.\n\nTrump defends Vance: The former president responded to backlash over 'childless cat ladies' comment\n\n\"In Vance's case, you don't really have any sort of other indication that he's ready,\" Goldstein said. \"So then when he gets out on the national stage, and is confronted with damaging clips from his past, and isn't very effective in handling them, it sort of reinforces questions about his inexperience.\"\n\nWalz's experience hasn't guaranteed name recognition though, a challenge he'll have to take on ahead of November. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they've never heard of Walz or were unsure how to rate him in a NPR/PBS/Marist national survey released this week.\n\nRegardless of their resumes and approaches, in the coming months, Vance and Walz will face a similar challenge. They'll have to make their pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job.\n\nThe country got a taste of Vance's willingness to vehemently defend his running mate and go after their opposition during his speech at the RNC accepting his VP nomination. Vance told the nation that Americans \"need\" Trump at this moment in history and bashed Biden and Harris' leadership.\n\nWalz will have the same opportunity as he takes up the running mate mantle ahead of the Democratic convention later this month.\n\nBut political observers have already seen a slice of how he'll go on offense. When he was simply a vice presidential candidate, Walz coined a new Democratic talking point, bashing Vance and Trump on TV and social media with a now-viral insult against his GOP opponents, labeling them \"weird.\"\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz told MSNBC. \"They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now Vice President Kamala Harrishas tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate to take on Republican Donald Trump and his No. 2, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nAs different as they are, Walz and Vance both qualify as picks meant to reassure their party's loyal base voters rather than adding homegrown heft in a critical battleground state.\n\nThe two No. 2s will also get a chance to square off in almost real time as Walz is traveling this week with Harris to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, while Vance will follow an overlapping itinerary to offer his own counterprograming in some places.\n\nSome takeaways on the race now that Harris has settled on Walz:\n\nHow Walz might help -- or hurt -- Harris' chances\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party's left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters. Some in Harris' inner circle saw Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Walz's ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Trump.\n\nExciting each side's most loyal supporters\n\nNeither vice presidential pick seems to do much to build out his party's coalition -- a sign that both campaigns view this election as about boosting turnout from their existing bases.\n\nJust as Walz hails from the solidly Democratic state of Minnesota, Vance comes from the safely Republican state of Ohio. There is a bet that each choice can radiate Midwestern appeal to the key \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin simply by dint of geographical proximity.\n\nHarris allies have stressed Walz's ability to appeal to rural voters, although his 2022 reelection as governor roughly matched the margins of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win in Minnesota. Trump won 6 in 10 rural and small town voters nationwide in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nThe Trump campaign was quick to try to connect Walz to its characterizations of Harris as a California liberal, saying his support for gun control and teachers unions make him a \"West Coast wannabe.\"\n\nVance, for his part, comes from a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 percentage points. Just like the former president with his book \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" Vance achieved national recognition with his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Vance has mainly played to cultural and policy issues favored by strict adherents of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement such as cutting military support for Ukraine.\n\nVance offering battleground counterprograming to Walz\n\nVance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Harris and Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His role is to attack the Biden administration's policies and tear down Harris' record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nVance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally. He said during his Philadelphia stop that \"I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\" but not until after the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris' team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nPlenty of drama still to come\n\nWalz's selection settled one big question mark among Democrats, but plenty of major challenges remain for the final months of a race already defined by its unexpected twists and turns.\n\nThere is the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East, the possibility of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve that might calm global financial markets and questions about whether Trump and Harris will actually square off in a September debate that was set before Biden bowed out of the race.\n\nNo matter what happens, the conventional narratives of a presidential campaign have already had seemingly brief shelf lives. Voters over the past few weeks have dealt with Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, a brazen assassination attempt on Trump, Biden's exit from the race and Harris' quick ascendance among Democrats.\n\nNow that both tickets are settled, a reckoning will take place over positions, and small differences can matter to voters who on the margin could decide a narrow election. Global events can upend talking points in ways that are hard to predict. The 2008 campaign intensified with that year's financial crisis, while the persistence of the coronavirus shaped 2020.\n\nIf there are any lessons from this year, it's that election year surprises are no longer reserved for October.\n\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"},

Republicans are working hard to halt the momentum surrounding Harris' presidential campaign. But Vance could falter in his efforts, as his standing with voters currently remains low.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is just hours away from embarking on a swing-state tour with her yet-to-be announced running mate, an effort that is poised to be a major turning point for Democratic ticket.\n\nBut if Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice-presidential nominee, has his way, Harris' time in the spotlight with her vice presidential pick won't be an easy experience.\n\nVance plans to follow Harris for three days and across four swing states as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns with her running mate, according to Politico. The rollout is especially important for Harris as she became the party's standard-bearer less than a month ago following President Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race.\n\nThe Ohioan is set to trail Harris in Philadelphia; Detroit; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Raleigh, North Carolina. And while Vance won't be headlining rallies, he'll be holding media appearances in the cities alongside voters critical of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nAt first glance, Vance's trip may not seem like a high-stakes effort.\n\nBut it's a gamble.\n\nRepublicans want to blunt Harris' momentum\n\nIn recent months, former President Donald Trump had been leading Biden in most major national polls. And Vance's vice presidential selection was seemingly aimed not at drawing in swing voters -- who had been souring on Biden -- but on firming up the Republican base.\n\nBut Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris' ability to quickly rally the party around her caught the GOP by surprise. And it sapped any real bump that could have resulted from last month's Republican National Convention.\n\nIn recent days, Harris and Trump have been locked in a close race in national and swing-state polls, with the vice president pulling ahead in some of the surveys.\n\nEnter Vance, who wants to halt any sort of sustained momentum for Harris as she stumps with her eventual vice presidential pick.\n\nWhen Harris appears in key battlegrounds this week, Vance will be there to attack the Democratic ticket on local news and bring out conservative voters to sharpen criticism of Biden's record on issues like the economy and immigration. The senator is seemingly aiming to get ahead of the news cycle to blunt a potential Democratic vice presidential honeymoon period.\n\nVance's effort could make him even more unpopular\n\nSince joining the GOP ticket last month, Vance's rollout has been a rocky one.\n\nVance already had a national profile due to his best-selling 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" But before Vance was elected to office in 2022, he made a raft of controversial statements, and during one notable interview, he deemed some Democratic Party leaders to be \"childless cat ladies\" who didn't have a stake in the country's future.\n\nVance's past remarks and MAGA-aligned views on issues like Ukraine (he opposes US funding for the conflict) haven't been a hit with voters. He boasted a minus-5-point favorability rating after the GOP convention. Last month, CNN reported that Vance had a double-digit unfavorable rating with voters in a group of Midwestern states that included his native Ohio.\n\nSo Vance's plan to lay into Harris and her running mate will be a tricky balancing act. He doesn't have the highest standing with voters right now, and if Harris taps either Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she'll have an executive by her side with real appeal among working-class voters.\n\nVance may struggle to define Harris' views\n\nVance will be looking to draw attention to the GOP ticket when Americans will naturally want to learn more about Harris' running mate.\n\nIt'll be a huge fight for attention during a time when Harris could receive another polling bump based on the selection.\n\nRepublicans have sought to depict Harris as too liberal for the country and have pointed to her San Francisco Bay Area roots to make their case.\n\nBut that argument thus far has not proven to be effective with voters.\n\nA vice presidential pick like Shapiro or Walz -- who are both seen as mainstream Democratic choices -- could throw cold water on some of the attacks over Harris' ideology.\n\nVance will surely hammer Harris over her past support for more liberal proposals on healthcare during her 2020 presidential campaign. But Harris now has a record as part of the administration, and she can point to populist achievements like capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for many Americans on Medicare.\n\nSome voters will applaud Vance's shadow tour of Harris' vice presidential rollout, while others will view it as a stunt. Either way, Vance's itinerary shows that Democrats have all the momentum right now, and Republicans are doing whatever they can to stop it.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.nl", "name": "John L.

Tim Walz as Her Running Mate", "body": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nKamala Harris officially has a running mate. Ever since July 21, when President Joe Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed Harris, allowing the Democrats to rally around her as the nominee, two questions dominated headlines and water-cooler chats: Who would she choose as her potential vice president, and would that duo be able to beat former president Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance in November?\n\nNow, Harris has chosen Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential pick, and the two are expected to appear in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first rally together. Per Reuters, the Harris campaign has stated that from Pennsylvania, the two will travel to six other stops, including Wisconsin, Detroit, and Las Vegas.\n\nWalz, who was born in rural Nebraska, according to his website, has been governor of Minnesota since 2019, previously serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to becoming an elected official, he served in the Army National Guard and taught at a public high school, where he was also the football coach. As governor, The New York Times reports, Walz has supported progressive policies, including codifying the right to abortion into Minnesota law, securing free lunch for public school students, legalizing marijuana, and signing a paid family and medical leave program into law. And in the run-up to Harris' announcement, he gave the Democratic Party a new, viral way to hit back at Trump and Vance: by simply calling them \"weird.\"\n\nIn a statement about the announcement, Harris wrote: \"One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It's personal.\" She then continued, \"But what impressed me most about Tim is his deep commitment to his family: Gwen, Gus, and Hope. Doug and I look forward to working with him and Gwen to build an administration that reflects our shared values.\" The pair now has 90 days to campaign together and make their case to America.\n\nIn contrast, Trump chose Vance as his running mate back on July 15, before Biden even dropped out of the race. Vance is currently a U.S. senator representing Ohio, but he first rose to fame as the author of Hillbilly Elegy, his 2016 bestselling memoir that recounts his time growing up in Middletown, Ohio, a Rust Belt town. Vance is also a veteran and ended up attending Yale Law School.\n\nIn the book, which has garnered some controversy, he \"writes about the social isolation, poverty, drug use and the religious and political changes in his family and in greater Appalachia,\" according to NPR's Terry Gross, who interviewed Vance when the book first came out. At the time, Vance told Gross: \"I identify with the millions of working-class white Americans of Scots-Irish descent who have no college degree. To these folks, poverty's the family tradition.\"\n\nNotably, Vance has transformed over the years. In 2016, he described himself as a \"Never Trump guy\" and once compared Trump to Adolf Hitler. Now, Vance is one of Trump's staunchest defenders; at the Republican National Convention in July, Vance told the crowd: \"For the last eight years, President Trump has given everything he has to fight for the people of our country. He didn't need politics, but the country needed him.\"", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And what is his relationship with Trump?\n\nBorn and raised in Middletown, Ohio, Vance joined the Marines at a young age and served in Iraq. He later pursued higher education at Ohio State University and Yale Law School before working as a venture capitalist.\n\nVance rose to prominence with his 2016 bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy, which was published during Trump's first presidential campaign. The book explored working-class struggles in middle America and provided insights into Trump's appeal among rural white voters. It also introduced Vance to the Trump family, leading to a lasting friendship with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFollowing his rise in fame, Vance pursued a political career in Ohio, participating in public events such as Lincoln Day Dinners to promote his political views. His political ambitions became official in 2021 when he ran for the Senate seat vacated by retired Republican Rob Portman. With Trump's endorsement, the Ohio native won the Republican primary and the general election, taking office in 2022.\n\nVance's relationship with the former US president has evolved over time. In 2016, he was a prominent \"Never Trump\" Republican, criticizing Trump as unfit for office. His wife, Indian-American lawyer Usha Chilukuri, even described Trump as \"America's Hitler.\"\n\nBy 2021, Vance had changed his stance, citing Trump's achievements during his presidency as reasons for his shift. Once elected in 2022, Vance became a strong supporter of Trump, defending his policies and praising his presidency. In an interview with Hannity, Vance stated, \"I think he (Trump) changed the minds of a lot of Americans because again he delivered that peace and prosperity.\"\n\nAs Trump's running mate, Vance is expected to play a key role in helping him secure states he lost in the 2020 election, including Michigan and Wisconsin, which have strong Republican presence.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk",

J.D. Vance (R-OH) took his first shot at Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) on Tuesday, calling Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate a \"double down choice for bad leadership.\"\n\nVance did not address Walz during a stump speech held in South Philadelphia, instead bringing to the microphone families hurt by what he described as Harris's failed border policies. He tied those policies to crime and a nationwide spike in drug deaths.\n\n\"I have to ask, why is it necessary? Why are they suffering?\" Vance said before detailing his own upbringing with a mother who struggled with addiction. \"And the answer is because we have a leadership that is failing.\"\n\nBut in a Q&A session held with reporters after his remarks, Vance, who former President Donald Trump chose as his running mate last month, laid into the man he could soon debate.\n\n\"She has governed as a San Francisco liberal, and she chose a running mate that will be a San Francisco-style liberal,\" he said of Harris, citing Walz's handling of the 2020 Minneapolis riots as governor and support for granting illegal immigrants driver's licenses.\n\nVance did not mention that he lived in San Francisco after graduating from Yale Law School in 2013, where he worked as a venture capitalist before returning to Ohio to launch a Senate run.\n\nDemocrats chose Walz, in part, due to his perceived appeal to working-class voters in Midwestern states. He is a veteran with an affable demeanor and previously represented a conservative district in the House of Representatives.\n\nBut Republicans relished the choice of Walz, whose unabashed progressive record has allowed them to reinforce their claims that Harris is out-of-step with the mainstream of the country.\n\n\"The biggest problem with the Tim Walz pick, it's not Tim Walz himself -- it's Kamala Harris,\" Vance said. \"That when given an opportunity, she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party, and that's exactly what she did here.\"\n\nBy choosing Walz, Harris passed over Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), whose Jewish heritage was viewed as a liability with pro-Palestinian voters in swing states such as Michigan.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nWalz also animated the political Left given his support for unions.\n\n\"Whatever disagreements on policy you have about somebody, the fact that the vice presidential race on the Democratic side became so focused on his ethnicity, I think, is absolutely disgraceful, and it's insulting to Americans, whatever background you're from,\" Vance said of Shapiro.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nThe event is one of several Vance will be holding over the next week as he shadows Harris's swing through a series of battleground states.\n\nWalz will hold his inaugural rally with Harris in Philadelphia later Tuesday, before headlining events with her in Wisconsin, Michigan, and elsewhere.\n\nThe Trump campaign has already announced campaign stops with Vance that mirror Harris's.\n\nAt the event, Vance acknowledged that he called to congratulate Walz on his selection as Harris's running mate, something he described as the \"polite\" thing to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBut he declined to debate Walz until the governor formally becomes the vice presidential nominee at the Democrats' convention in Chicago in two weeks.\n\n\"And then, of course, we want to have a robust debate,\" Vance said before criticizing Harris for not holding interviews with the media since her campaign launch.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "washington_examiner@gazette.com", "name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "david_sivak@gazette.com", "name": "David Sivak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Now Vice President Kamala Harrishas tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate to take on Republican Donald Trump and his No. 2, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nAs different as they are, Walz and Vance both qualify as picks meant to reassure their party\u00b4s loyal base voters rather than adding homegrown heft in a critical battleground state.\n\nThe two No. 2s will also get a chance to square off in almost real time as Walz is traveling this week with Harris to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, while Vance will follow an overlapping itinerary to offer his own counterprograming in some places.\n\nSome takeaways on the race now that Harris has settled on Walz:\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party\u00b4s left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters. Some in Harris' inner circle saw Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Walz\u00b4s ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nFILE - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks before President Joe Biden at Dutch Creek Farms, Nov. 1, 2023, in Northfield, Minn. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr, File)\n\nActivists who for months have followed Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Trump.\n\nNeither vice presidential pick seems to do much to build out his party\u00b4s coalition - a sign that both campaigns view this election as about boosting turnout from their existing bases.\n\nJust as Walz hails from the solidly Democratic state of Minnesota, Vance comes from the safely Republican state of Ohio. There is a bet that each choice can radiate Midwestern appeal to the key \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin simply by dint of geographical proximity.\n\nHarris allies have stressed Walz\u00b4s ability to appeal to rural voters, although his 2022 reelection as governor roughly matched the margins of Joe Biden\u00b4s 2020 presidential win in Minnesota. Trump won 6 in 10 rural and small town voters nationwide in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nThe Trump campaign was quick to try to connect Walz to its characterizations of Harris as a California liberal, saying his support for gun control and teachers unions make him a \"West Coast wannabe.\"\n\nVance, for his part, comes from a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 percentage points. Just like the former president with his book \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" Vance achieved national recognition with his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Vance has mainly played to cultural and policy issues favored by strict adherents of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement such as cutting military support for Ukraine.\n\nVance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Harris and Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His role is to attack the Biden administration's policies and tear down Harris\u00b4 record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nVance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally. He said during his Philadelphia stop that \"I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\" but not until after the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris' team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nWalz\u00b4s selection settled one big question mark among Democrats, but plenty of major challenges remain for the final months of a race already defined by its unexpected twists and turns.\n\nThere is the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East, the possibility of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve that might calm global financial markets and questions about whether Trump and Harris will actually square off in a September debate that was set before Biden bowed out of the race.\n\nNo matter what happens, the conventional narratives of a presidential campaign have already had seemingly brief shelf lives. Voters over the past few weeks have dealt with Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, a brazen assassination attempt on Trump, Biden's exit from the race and Harris' quick ascendance among Democrats.\n\nNow that both tickets are settled, a reckoning will take place over positions, and small differences can matter to voters who on the margin could decide a narrow election. Global events can upend talking points in ways that are hard to predict. The 2008 campaign intensified with that year\u00b4s financial crisis, while the persistence of the coronavirus shaped 2020.\n\nIf there are any lessons from this year, it\u00b4s that election year surprises are no longer reserved for October.\n\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, concludes his remarks before taking questions with reporters at a news conference, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in Philadelphia.

The junior senator recently came under fire for comments about Americans without biological children - a demographic that includes Harris - referring to them as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America, in a 2021 interview with Fox News.\n\nVance's controversy, coupled with rising excitement over Harris' jump to the top of the ticket, has given Democrats a boost less than 100 days to Election Day.\n\nRead More:\n\nBut how long will that boost last? Harris tapping Walz sets the stage for a contentious match-up between the experienced Midwestern governor and fresh-faced senator with a few years in Washington.\n\nSo how does Walz stack up to Vance?\n\nOn a slew of issues, Walz and Vance are generally aligned with their running mates - and distinct from one another.\n\nVance has been an outspoken opponent of abortion - an issue expected to play a key role in 2024 - but backed Trump's public position of leaving decisions around restrictions to individual states. However, the senator has said previously he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\"\n\nWalz is more in lockstep with Harris, as an equally vocal supporter of reproductive rights on the campaign trail. And the same dynamic plays out between Trump and Vance - and Harris and Walz - on issues ranging from climate change to immigration and more.\n\nAcross the board, though, Vance in recent years has doubled down on Trump's stances. His position as a MAGA-megaphone made Vance a more unusual choice, said Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It wasn't a pick that seemed to reach out to a different sector of the Republican Party, or to unify the party or the country,\" Goldstein told USA TODAY. \"It seemed that Senator Vance was, of all the candidates, the one who had gone to the greatest lengths to associate himself with former President Trump.\"\n\nHarris picking Walz also doesn't necessarily represent bringing together differing Democrats.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nBut what else do Walz and Vance bring to the table? Originally added to the GOP ticket to attract swing state voters and face a former senator from California - before Biden bowed out of the 2024 race - Vance may have a different fight against Walz, a two-term governor with years in politics under his belt.\n\nNow, Vance isn't the only Midwesterner in the game. In naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states, and beyond.\n\nWalz, 60, has also been governor of Minnesota - a decades-long Democratic stronghold - since 2018, coming off 12 years of representing the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Walz also served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nTrump's pick, meanwhile, lacks the experience of a typical vice president, Goldstein said.\n\nVance, a 40 year old who previously served in the Marines, made his introduction to politics two years ago after rising to fame with his best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his 2022 Senate campaign, he faced a competitive Republican primary and was ultimately boosted by a coveted Trump endorsement.\n\nBut in a presidential election, experience isn't everything, Goldstein cautioned. After all, concerns about Biden and Trump's ages have taken center stage for months.\n\n\"The fact that you have X years of experience doesn't mean that you're ready,\" he said, \"and the fact that you have very little doesn't mean that you're not ready for the national stage.\"\n\nBut Vance's greenness may already be taking its toll.\n\nJust under 30% of voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Buckeye State lawmaker, a historic low for a potential vice president, in a CNN/SSRS poll published July 24.\n\n\"In Vance's case, you don't really have any sort of other indication that he's ready,\" Goldstein said. \"So then when he gets out on the national stage, and is confronted with damaging clips from his past, and isn't very effective in handling them, it sort of reinforces questions about his inexperience.\"\n\nWalz's experience hasn't guaranteed name recognition though, a challenge he'll have to take on ahead of November. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they've never heard of Walz or were unsure how to rate him in a NPR/PBS/Maris national survey released this week.\n\nRegardless of their resumes and approaches, in the coming months, Vance and Walz will face a similar challenge. They'll have to make their pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job.\n\nThe country got a taste of Vance's willingness to vehemently defend his running mate and go after their opposition during his speech at the RNC accepting his VP nomination. Vance told the nation that Americans \"need\" Trump at this moment in history and bashed Biden and Harris' leadership.\n\nWalz will have the same opportunity as he takes up the running mate mantle ahead of the Democratic convention later this month.\n\nBut political observers have already seen a slice of how he'll go on offense. When he was simply a vice presidential candidate, Walz coined a new Democratic talking point, bashing Vance and Trump on TV and social media with a now-viral insult against his GOP opponents, labeling them \"weird.\"\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz told MSNBC. \"They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now Vice President Kamala Harrishas tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate to take on Republican Donald Trump and his No. 2, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nAs different as they are, Walz and Vance both qualify as picks meant to reassure their party's loyal base voters rather than adding homegrown heft in a critical battleground state.\n\nThe two No. 2s will also get a chance to square off in almost real time as Walz is traveling this week with Harris to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, while Vance will follow an overlapping itinerary to offer his own counterprograming in some places.\n\nSome takeaways on the race now that Harris has settled on Walz:\n\nHow Walz might help -- or hurt -- Harris' chances\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party's left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters. Some in Harris' inner circle saw Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on Aug. 19.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Walz's ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Trump.\n\nExciting each side's most loyal supporters\n\nNeither vice presidential pick seems to do much to build out his party's coalition -- a sign that both campaigns view this election as about boosting turnout from their existing bases.\n\nJust as Walz hails from the solidly Democratic state of Minnesota, Vance comes from the safely Republican state of Ohio. There is a bet that each choice can radiate Midwestern appeal to the key \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin simply by dint of geographical proximity.\n\nHarris allies have stressed Walz's ability to appeal to rural voters, although his 2022 reelection as governor roughly matched the margins of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win in Minnesota. Trump won 6 in 10 rural and small town voters nationwide in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nThe Trump campaign was quick to try to connect Walz to its characterizations of Harris as a California liberal, saying his support for gun control and teachers unions make him a \"West Coast wannabe.\"\n\nVance, for his part, comes from a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 percentage points. Just like the former president with his book \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" Vance achieved national recognition with his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Vance has mainly played to cultural and policy issues favored by strict adherents of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement such as cutting military support for Ukraine.\n\nVance offering battleground counterprograming to Walz\n\nVance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Harris and Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His role is to attack the Biden administration's policies and tear down Harris' record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nVance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally. He said during his Philadelphia stop that \"I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,\" but not until after the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris' team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n\"We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak.\n\nPlenty of drama still to come\n\nWalz's selection settled one big question mark among Democrats, but plenty of major challenges remain for the final months of a race already defined by its unexpected twists and turns.\n\nThere is the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East, the possibility of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve that might calm global financial markets and questions about whether Trump and Harris will actually square off in a September debate that was set before Biden bowed out of the race.\n\nNo matter what happens, the conventional narratives of a presidential campaign have already had seemingly brief shelf lives. Voters over the past few weeks have dealt with Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, a brazen assassination attempt on Trump, Biden's exit from the race and Harris' quick ascendance among Democrats.\n\nNow that both tickets are settled, a reckoning will take place over positions, and small differences can matter to voters who on the margin could decide a narrow election. Global events can upend talking points in ways that are hard to predict. The 2008 campaign intensified with that year's financial crisis, while the persistence of the coronavirus shaped 2020.\n\nIf there are any lessons from this year, it's that election year surprises are no longer reserved for October.\n\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

That's the Donald Trump approach. If you don't do that you don't have a real border,\" Vance said.\n\nHe pinned responsibility for illegal fentanyl trafficking and fatal overdoses on Harris' border policy, though federal data show overdose deaths have largely been on the rise amid some periods of plateaus across at least the past three administrations before beginning a recent downturn.\n\nA local couple spoke on stage about the loss of their daughter to a fentanyl overdose. Another city woman spoke of the impacts on her community and her family.\n\n\"It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we reelect Donald J. Trump,\" Vance said.\n\nThe use of the word \"normal\" stood out Tuesday during Vance's campaign stop. It appeared purposeful, a response to how Democrats have been calling Republican leaders and their own policies \"weird.\" That seemed to begin with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz who on Tuesday was named by Harris as her running mate this fall.\n\nVance was brief in his comments on Walz, saying that Democrats have \"shown a willingness to pull a little switcheroo on us,\" a reference to Biden dropping out of the race on July 21. He called Walz's record a \"joke,\" blaming the governor for allowing destructive riots in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd by a police officer. He rapped Harris, too, for supporting a bail fund for protestors.\n\n\"I think what the Tim Walz selection says is that Kamala Harris has bent the knee to the far left of her party which is what she always does,\" Vance said, adding that he'd welcome a debate against Walz.\n\nVance said a second Trump presidency would improve America's standing on the world stage. He said Russia would never have invaded Ukraine were Trump still in office, saying Trump engages in diplomacy while Harris takes a saber-rattling approach.\n\nHe advocated for peace in the Middle East by building relationships between Israel and Sunni Arab countries to counter Iran's influence.\n\nVance challenged reporters to demand Harris answer policy questions, pointing out how she hasn't done an interview in weeks and saying she must explain her positions including policy shifts on fracking, police funding and inflation.\n\n\"She is running a basement campaign where she refuses to go before the free press and actually answer their questions. What kind of election can you have if your own presidential candidate won't actually answer tough questions,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

The junior senator recently came under fire for comments about Americans without biological children - a demographic that includes Harris - referring to them as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America, in a 2021 interview with Fox News.\n\n'A quip': Usha Vance, JD Vance's wife, defends his 'childless cat ladies' comments\n\nVance's controversy, coupled with rising excitement over Harris' jump to the top of the ticket, has given Democrats a boost less than 100 days to Election Day.\n\nBut how long will that boost last? Harris tapping Walz sets the stage for a contentious match-up between the experienced Midwestern governor and fresh-faced senator with a few years in Washington.\n\nSo how does Walz stack up to Vance?\n\nOn a slew of issues, Walz and Vance are generally aligned with their running mates - and distinct from one another.\n\nVance has been an outspoken opponent of abortion - an issue expected to play a key role in 2024 - but backed Trump's public position of leaving decisions around restrictions to individual states. However, the senator has said previously he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\"\n\nWalz is more in lockstep with Harris, as an equally vocal supporter of reproductive rights on the campaign trail. And the same dynamic plays out between Trump and Vance - and Harris and Walz - on issues ranging from climate change to immigration and more.\n\nAcross the board, though, Vance in recent years has doubled down on Trump's stances. His position as a MAGA-megaphone made Vance a more unusual choice, said Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar at Saint Louis University.\n\n\"It wasn't a pick that seemed to reach out to a different sector of the Republican Party, or to unify the party or the country,\" Goldstein told USA TODAY. \"It seemed that Senator Vance was, of all the candidates, the one who had gone to the greatest lengths to associate himself with former President Trump.\"\n\nHarris picking Walz also doesn't necessarily represent bringing together differing Democrats.\n\nHe has been an ardent supporter of President Joe Biden and was a surrogate for his reelection campaign. After the president's disastrous debate performance in June, Walz often took to the airwaves to defend Biden and boast about the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts.\n\nBut what else do Walz and Vance bring to the table? Originally added to the GOP ticket to attract swing state voters and face a former senator from California - before Biden bowed out of the 2024 race - Vance may have a different fight against Walz, a two-term governor with years in politics under his belt.\n\nNow, Vance isn't the only Midwesterner in the game. In naming Walz as her running mate, Harris selected a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states, and beyond.\n\nWalz, 60, has also been governor of Minnesota - a decades-long Democratic stronghold - since 2018, coming off 12 years of representing the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. Walz also served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nTrump's pick, meanwhile, lacks the experience of a typical vice president, Goldstein said.\n\nVance, a 40 year old who previously served in the Marines, made his introduction to politics two years ago after rising to fame with his best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his 2022 Senate campaign, he faced a competitive Republican primary and was ultimately boosted by a coveted Trump endorsement.\n\nBut in a presidential election, experience isn't everything, Goldstein cautioned. After all, concerns about Biden and Trump's ages have taken center stage for months.\n\n\"The fact that you have X years of experience doesn't mean that you're ready,\" he said, \"and the fact that you have very little doesn't mean that you're not ready for the national stage.\"\n\nBut Vance's greenness may already be taking its toll.\n\nJust under 30% of voters said they have a favorable opinion of the Buckeye State lawmaker, a historic low for a potential vice president, in a CNN/SSRS poll published July 24.\n\nTrump defends Vance: The former president responded to backlash over 'childless cat ladies' comment\n\n\"In Vance's case, you don't really have any sort of other indication that he's ready,\" Goldstein said. \"So then when he gets out on the national stage, and is confronted with damaging clips from his past, and isn't very effective in handling them, it sort of reinforces questions about his inexperience.\"\n\nWalz's experience hasn't guaranteed name recognition though, a challenge he'll have to take on ahead of November. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they've never heard of Walz or were unsure how to rate him in a NPR/PBS/Marist national survey released this week.\n\nRegardless of their resumes and approaches, in the coming months, Vance and Walz will face a similar challenge. They'll have to make their pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job.\n\nThe country got a taste of Vance's willingness to vehemently defend his running mate and go after their opposition during his speech at the RNC accepting his VP nomination. Vance told the nation that Americans \"need\" Trump at this moment in history and bashed Biden and Harris' leadership.\n\nWalz will have the same opportunity as he takes up the running mate mantle ahead of the Democratic convention later this month.\n\nBut political observers have already seen a slice of how he'll go on offense. When he was simply a vice presidential candidate, Walz coined a new Democratic talking point, bashing Vance and Trump on TV and social media with a now-viral insult against his GOP opponents, labeling them \"weird.\"\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" Walz told MSNBC. \"They wanna take books away, they wanna be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak, listen to how they talk about things.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He's run a company. He's organized people. He served in the U.S. Senate. He's been in those briefings on national security. He's got the personality of a leader: he's bold, he's ready to move forward. So, I think JD Vance is ready to step forward if God forbid the situation is needed.\"\n\nHowever, recent polls have shown a historic dislike for Vance among voters across the country. Immediately following the Convention, Vance was polling at a negative 6-point favorability rating. For historical context, Sarah Palin and Dan Quayle, two of the most heavily criticized running mate selections in recent memory, both held double-digit positive approval scores coming out of their respective conventions (Palin in 2008 and Quayle in 1988).\n\nUnfortunately for Vance's outspoken supporters, Wahl included, the senator's \"bold\" personality appears to be harming him in the polls.\n\nVarious critiques have been levied against Vance, including his lack of experience (Vance has only served two years in the Senate), his sudden switch from being a \"'never Trump' guy\" in 2016 to becoming the very same man's running mate two terms later, and his particularly patriarchal brand of theocratic conservatism.\n\nOn that last point, Vance's poor approval seems to be due in large part to comments he has made attacking Democratic leaders and their constituents as \"childless cat ladies\" and \"childless sociopaths.\" The senator has also stated that individuals with children should have their votes weighted more heavily than those without.\n\nDespite what some Republican elites like Wahl may think of Vance, his rhetoric, or his issue positions, the JD Vance brand is clearly not gelling with the American people. In fact, Vance's numbers have only declined further, with his favorability now sitting at a disheartening negative 15 points, according to the latest polling.\n\nNow, some of Wahl's fellow conservative operatives are souring on Vance. That includes right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro who asked: \"If you had a time machine, if you could go back two weeks, would [Trump] have picked JD Vance again? I doubt it.\"\n\nOthers, like Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, are sticking by Vance: \"There is value that comes from experience, but generations are changing. The way people look at the world and the things they know are different than the people who have been here longer.\"\n\nUncertainty surrounds how Vance's weak polling will be handled by the Trump campaign going forward as they seek to reset their campaign strategy following Vice President Kamala Harris's ascendency as the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nIt appears that Vance may not be the \"common sense\" pick that Wahl, Trump, and other GOP officials had previously anticipated. Wahl, the Alabama GOP, and Republicans at large must now consider how they can help the Trump campaign navigate this situation moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quayle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quayle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Palin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Trump_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Never Trump movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Moran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Moran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.alreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/24216787108070-e1722947884852-1024x576.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

In it, I called him \"unforgiving\" and slammed his gross portrayal of all hillbillies as violent, shiftless drug addicts.\n\nOne thing I didn't say at the time -- though I detested Vance's generalizations, I still held some modicum of respect for him because, as a Republican, he had the nerve to call Trump out. In October 2016, he tweeted: \"Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible.\" When the world saw Trump brag about grabbing women's vaginas, Vance tweeted, \"What percentage of the American population has @realdonaldtrump sexually assaulted?\"\n\nRecently publicized correspondence shows that, around this time, Vance also joined a San Francisco pride celebration and said it was \"nice to see a lot of happy people\" there. He even signed an email to a transgender friend, \"love you.\"\n\nI, of course, knew nothing about Vance's personal life then, but he did strike me as thoughtful, if a bit naive. I figured, as he aged, he'd see mountain people in a new light, becoming more sensible, more balanced. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nSince then, he's called LGBTQ+ people groomers, women who don't have children miserable and no-fault divorce a \"great trick\" played by the sexual revolution. In one bizarre video, he says parents should have more power in the democratic process than nonparents.\n\nFor me, this stunning about-face was like watching Anakin Skywalker go to the Dark Side of the Force. As I did while \"Star Wars: Episode III\" played on the big screen, I kept thinking, \"Dude, you're better than this. Turn back!\"\n\nInstead, Vance ran for the U.S. Senate and kissed the proverbial ring of a man he once said may be \"America's Hitler,\" winning Trump's endorsement.\n\n\"When we got to know each other, he liked me,\" Trump said of Vance, \"maybe more than anybody liked me.\"\n\nThat alignment might have curtailed Vance's wild vacillations because, contrary to some of his ramblings, Trump's actions are eerily consistent.\n\nLong before attempting to sway the 2020 election, Trump made his disregard for the democratic process clear by praising Chinese President Xi Jinping as \"president for life\" and saying, \"I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.\" Trump's threats to persecute opponents via the Department of Justice are no real surprise either. He once tried to appoint an acting attorney general who posited that the Department of Justice \"is not independent.\" The former president also says he wants to deport up to 11 million migrants. If he's elected, you can bet he'll try because Trump is Trump. For all his faults, this man lays his cards on the table.\n\nVance, though, discards over and over again, always creating a new hand, like life is one big rummy game.\n\nWhen he became a vice presidential candidate contender, Vance went from opposing practically all abortions nationwide, even in cases of incest and rape, to deferring to Trump's position, suddenly supporting \"states making the decision.\"\n\nAfter asking how many people Trump sexually assaulted and countless statements about the sanctity of family, Vance stood outside the courtroom where Trump was on trial for using hush money to hide his marital affair. There, Vance bashed the prosecution's star witness.\n\nEven Vance's personal life is a study in contradictions. While he rubbed shoulders with podcaster Jack Murphy, who once advocated raping feminists, Vance's wife, Usha, worked at a Washington, D.C., law firm described as \"woke\" and \"radically progressive\" by The American Lawyer.\n\nTo this day, the couple lives in a lefty Alexandria, Virginia, neighborhood, where more than 80% of residents voted for Biden in 2020. I know because my husband and I have an apartment a few blocks from them. In Cincinnati, the Vances bought in another progressive neighborhood, and it's hard to imagine why. They've surely alienated every liberal they know.\n\nRegardless, during last month's Republican National Convention, Usha said her husband remained the same JD she met at Yale University. I laughed. How is that remotely possible? He's not even the same JD we saw a few years back. Heck, I'm not even sure he's the same JD at work as he is at home.\n\nThis leaves a lot of folks on both sides of the aisle scratching their heads and asking which version of Vance to believe.\n\nAfter watching him for years, I'd say all and none. Vance is a shape-shifting opportunist. He will bend his viewpoint to whatever is advantageous. He'll morph to climb, and personally, I find his lack of conviction as alarming as his newly radicalized politics.\n\nBut, then again, maybe it takes moral fluidity to go from total obscurity to vice presidential candidate in under 10 years. Maybe it will take hyper-relativism to weather the bad press Vance faces now.\n\nOne thing is for sure -- Vance is not giving up. He's worked too hard and come too far.\n\nIn an era of ceaseless distractions and microscopic attention spans, I think he will pivot, pivot, pivot, and wait out the storm. After a few thousand scrolls, voters may forget about the troublesome clips and tweets that have surfaced. It happened with Trump's \"grab them by their (vulgarity)\" video, so why not again?\n\nAnd Vance is only 40 years old. If he survives these headlines and continues to morph, he may prove to be the perfect kind of politician for this click-driven century.\n\n____\n\nMark Lynn Ferguson has written about Appalachia for nearly 15 years and leads the magazine Woodshed: An Appalachian Joint.

The Ohio senator has been at the center of more than a few bizarre rumors, memes and jokes in the weeks since he was announced as Trump's running mate.\n\nLuke Schroeder, Vance's spokesperson, declined to comment to The Enquirer about the rumors.\n\nHere's what we know, and don't know, about some of the most viral Vance rumors.\n\nDid JD Vance write about having sex with a couch in 'Hillbilly Elegy'?\n\nOne of the more well-known Vance rumors can be traced to a July 15 post on X shared by the now-closed account, @rickrudescalves. Shortly after Vance was announced as Trump's running mate, the X user claimed Vance admitted to a sexual act with couch cushions in his 2016 memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nThe post, since deleted, read, \"can't say for sure but he might be the first vp pick to have admitted in a ny times bestseller to (expletive) an Inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (vance, hillbilly elegy, pp. 179-181).\"\n\nA quick glance at Vance's book \"Hillbilly Elegy\" shows the claim was fake, but it spread like internet wildfire. It even popped up in TV references on shows like \"Last Week Tonight\" hosted by John Oliver and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\nThe joke circulated, and people believed it, so much that Snopes and the Associated Press wrote fact-checks debunking it. AP later deleted its fact-check.\n\nThe rumor's originator, @rickrudescalves, told Business Insider he identifies with the political left and does not work in politics. He said he made up the joke because he does not like Vance and thought it was funny. He hid the post within a week because he was uncomfortable with the amount of attention it got, and admitted to creating misinformation, though he said that was not his intent.\n\nWhat did JD Vance post about dolphins?\n\nOn Feb. 17, Vance posted a screenshot on X of another account's post. The post, from @crazyclipsonly, shows an image of two men and one woman on a dock where two dolphins are jumping out of the water. The post is captioned, \"Woman gets violated by a dolphin and enjoys it.\"\n\nVance joked about the terrible things one can find online, writing, \"Maybe the internet was a mistake.\"\n\nHowever, the post took a turn in July, after Vance was announced as Trump's running mate, when X users pointed out that the words \"Woman\" and \"dolphin\" are bolded in the post, indicating those were the words Vance had searched on X. This led commenters to question why Vance was searching for posts about a \"woman\" and \"dolphin.\"\n\n\"WHY ARE THOSE TWO WORDS HIGHLIGHTED?!?!?\" one person commented on July 26.\n\n\"I dread to think what the rest of your search history looks like dude,\" another wrote.\n\nSince X bolds searched terms, it's possible Vance had seen the post earlier and searched for it in order to make the joke. The senator does not follow @crazyclipsonly.\n\nThe X post is still up, and Vance did not respond to commenters.\n\nWhat was found on JD Vance's Venmo?\n\nMost of Vance's transactions on Venmo were private or mundane, but his friends list on the app revealed some high-profile and controversial people he may be connected to, Wired reported.\n\nFriends lists are auto-populated on the app, which is owned by PayPal and used to send money electronically, by users' phone contacts. That means Vance's Venmo friends are likely people who were in his cellphone contacts list when he first joined the platform in 2016, not people with whom he has necessarily shared transactions. The app also allows users to send and receive money to people not on their friends list.\n\nStill, Wired reported several notable people on Vance's friends list. Amalia Halikias, government relations director for the Heritage Foundation, credited with Project 2025, was on the list, according to the outlet. Halikias didn't start working for The Heritage Foundation until 2023, according to her LinkedIn, and attended Yale the same time Vance did.\n\nVance was also connected with several Trump critics, including Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator and Republican.\n\nWired also reported that people affiliated with conservative groups like the Hoover Institution and American Enterprise Institute, executives with Anthropic and AOL, and journalists like former Fox News host Tucker Carlson were also on Vance's friends lists.\n\nVance's Venmo account appears to now be deleted (he does not appear in the friends list of his wife, sister or mother, all of whom have accounts).\n\nDoes JD Vance wear eyeliner?\n\nViewers have noticed one thing about Vance since he stepped into the national TV spotlight - his eyes. The senator has blue eyes and dark eyelashes, causing some social media users to claim he wears eyeliner.\n\nTheories about Vance's eyes are all over TikTok, where some users even think they've nailed down what specific product he could be using.\n\nVance has not addressed the speculation.\n\nOthers on social media have pointed to old pictures of the nominee, such as his Marine Corps photo, to show that he's always had dark eyelashes.\n\nWhat did JD Vance say about Mountain Dew?\n\nAt his Middletown rally last month, Vance joked Democrats will say it's \"racist to do anything,\" including drinking Diet Mountain Dew.\n\n\"I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today, and I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too,\" he told the crowd.\n\nThis spawned social media posts and call-outs about the soda, including a response from Kentucky governor and potential Democratic VP nominee Andy Beshear.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He loves family. It's very important to him.\"\n\nBut Griffin, who served as White House director of strategic communications under Trump's administration, said on Monday that the impact of Vance's statements would likely continue to sting the GOP.\n\n\"This cat lady comment has just really stuck in a way that I haven't seen with many things in politics,\" Griffin said during an appearance on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\n\n\"And the Trump news cycle, things tend to move rapidly. But with JD Vance, this has become like a 3-week-long story, and it's genuinely hurting him with a demo that he needs the most -- suburban women,\" she continued. \"It's just radioactive.\"\n\nPolling has shown that Vice President Kamala Harris' entry into the 2024 election has further hurt Trump's chances of winning over women voters. In a survey by The New York Times and Siena College released on July 25, Harris held a 15-point lead over Trump among women voters, an 8-point jump from President Joe Biden's support among women earlier last month.\n\nHarris has also taken the lead or closed the gap on Trump across several national polls. Issues involving abortion have been a winning topic for Democrats since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Since launching his reelection campaign, Trump has been found liable of sexual assault and was convicted of 34 felony charges over a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, who said she was paid in 2016 to stay quiet about an extramarital affair she had with Trump in 2006. Trump denies ever having sexual relations with Daniels.\n\nExperts have said that Trump's pick in Vance is likely going to alienate some voter demographics. The Ohio senator in 2021 suggested that women should stay in violent marriages for the sake of their children, and he once supported a national 15-week pregnancy term ban on abortion. Vance has since said that he agrees with Trump that abortion should be decided at the state level and often accuses Democrats of mischaracterizing his words.\n\nGriffin said on Monday that additional controversial statements from Vance were likely to come \"because there just fundamentally was no vetting of JD Vance before he was added to the ticket.\"\n\n\"And this will not be the last comment that we see that is very radioactive with independents needed to win this election,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_lewis@newsweek.com", "name": "Kaitlin Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Farah_Griffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Farah Griffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oligarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Situation_Room_with_Wolf_Blitzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

JD Vance highlighted what he called the \"chaos\" sown by Vice President Kamala Harris as the nation's \"border czar\" and its effect on American families during an afternoon rally in Philadelphia.\n\nVance, former President Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, led the Tuesday afternoon rally while he and others stood before a large dark-blue banner with \"Harris Chaos\" written in large white block letters.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has been such a disaster as vice president of the country that everywhere she goes chaos and uncertainty follow,\" Vance told the crowd at the 2300 Arena in south Philadelphia.\n\nHe cited the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, chaos in the global financial markets and fentanyl decimating families and communities throughout the United States as consequences of the policies supported by and promoted by Harris as a member of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"Everything that Kamala Harris touches turns into a disaster,\" Vance said. \"We need to kick her out of the United States government, not give her a promotion.\"\n\nHe then enumerated ways in which he said Harris has failed as the nation's so-called \"border czar\" and someone who has been in charge of immigration issues at the behest of President Joe Biden.\n\n\"On day one, Kamala Harris suspended deportations. On Day one, Kamala Harris stopped the remain-in-Mexico policy that kept our country safe,\" Vance said. \"On day one, border czar Kamala Harris stopped construction of the southern border wall, and on day one she proposed amnesty for millions of illegal aliens in this country.\"\n\nHe said every time Harris acted to open the nation's southern border, U.S. \"families suffered.\"\n\nOthers criticize Harris on immigration, too\n\nVance then allowed a married couple and a self-described \"young melanated woman\" from Philadelphia to discuss how the border and immigration policies of the Biden-Harris administration have harmed her family and community.\n\nDenise and Mike Trask told the rally about how their daughter became addicted to opioids but became clean and sober until suffering a relapse.\n\nShe unknowingly bought heroin that was laced with fentanyl, they said, and died of an accidental overdose in her car in the parking lot of a Philadelphia-area shopping mall at age 26.\n\n\"Fentanyl is killing thousands and thousands of people every day,\" Denise Trask said.\n\nShe said the \"border travesty that this current administration has neglected\" has caused great harm in communities throughout the country.\n\nSouth Philadelphia native Denise Briggs also addressed the audience and described how her brother became addicted to opioids and how her mother keeps Narcan in her closet in case he doesn't wake up one morning.\n\n\"I feel compelled to address the opioid crisis that's affecting our community,\" Briggs said. \"Democrats' soft-on-crime policies have led the city I once knew to become unrecognizable.\"\n\nShe said there have been what she called noticeable increases in homelessness, drug addiction and murders since President Joe Biden took office.\n\nFentanyl is \"too easily accessible\" and opioids \"are not racially profiled drugs,\" she said. \"This crisis knows no demographic.\"\n\n\"The border crisis has led an influx of drugs coming across the border and impacting families like mine,\" Briggs said.\n\nWhen Vance returned to the mic, he asked: \"Why is it necessary? Why are they suffering?\"\n\n\"The answer is because we have a leadership that is failing them,\" Vance said.\n\nWhen later asked at the event about why he favored building a wall at the southern border, Vance said a 100-foot-high wall will stop most of the illegal crossings and significantly slow the fentanyl trafficking and other crimes coming across the border into the United States.\n\nVance said he recently visited the southern border and saw uninstalled pieces of border fence still on the ground because, he said, Harris ordered all wall construction to stop.\n\nVance spoke of his mother's prior addiction and how she recovered 10 years ago and is clean and sober today.\n\nHe said his family got a second chance, and his 7-year-old son only knows her as \"the best grandmother anyone could ask for.\"\n\nVance criticizes press on Harris\n\nVance implored media to \"show a little bit of shame\"and ask Harris some \"tough questions\" when she visits Philadelphia later Tuesday evening.\n\nHe accused Harris of \"running a basement campaign where she refuses to go before the free press and answer any questions\" and said she has avoided media questions for \"16 days and counting.\"\n\nHe said Harris should answer questions regarding why she once said she would ban fracking but now says she won't and why she wanted to defund the police but now says she doesn't.\n\nVance also suggested the news media ask Harris why groceries and housing are unaffordable for so many.\n\nVance pans Walz as Harris VP pick\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about Harris' announcement of appointing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate earlier Tuesday, Vance said the appointment is because \"Kamala Harris bent the knee to the far-left of the [Democratic] party.\"\n\nVance described Harris and Walz as \"San Francisco-style liberals\" and said they make an interesting team.\n\n\"Walz let rioters burn down Minneapolis, and Harris is the one who bailed the rioters out of jail,\" Vance said. \"So there's an interesting team in that sense.\"\n\nHarris and Walz are scheduled to attend a political rally at Temple University in Philadelphia Tuesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\n1. What do vice presidents actually do?\n\nAs political scientist Joshua Holzer noted, the U.S. Constitution has only a few references to the vice presidency.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\n2. Do no harm\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\n3. Trump's choice\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and heprivately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nBut people close to Trump call the 39-year-old Vance the new heir to Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nWhat can be concluded from Trump choosing Vance?\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\n(Howard Manly is the race and equity editor of The Conversation.)", "source": {"uri":

She said she has spoken to swing voters and that their overwhelming response to Vance is thinking he is a \"phony.\"\n\n\"The thing that is killing JD Vance is that voters, and I have listened to tons of swing voters since he was picked, and they don't like him at all, they think he seems like a phony,\" she told MSNBC's Inside with Jen Psaki.\n\nShe said that swing voters are very aware of Vance's flip-flopping on Trump. In the past, Vance has described some of Trump's voter base as being racist, said he might consider voting for Hillary Clinton to stop Trump's ascendancy, and has called Trump a \"fraud,\" a \"moral disaster,\" a \"cynical a**hole,\" a \"bad man,\" and \"America's Hitler.\"\n\n\"[Voters] also get ... it's like vibes, right? Voters can smell inauthenticity and that's what JD Vance reeks of to them,\" she said.\n\nVance flipped his feelings on Trump and MAGA right around 2022, when he was planning to run for Ohio's vacant Senate seat and needed the former president's endorsement.\n\nBut hypocrisy and flip-flopping are increasingly survivable in modern electoral politics. Democrats, including presumptive 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris, have been using another descriptor when discussing Vance: weird. Since July 23, Harris's campaign has called Trump and Vance \"weird\" in at least 14 posts.\n\n\"My attitude is, I'm just gonna be who I am. If they want to attack me for whatever they're going to attack me on that's fine. You just have to power through and do your thing,\" Vance said on a podcast in late July.\n\nFor Vance, \"doing his thing\" apparently includes telling his seven-year-old son to \"shut the hell up,\" suggesting that people with children are more invested in the nation and deserve more voting power than people without children, and dreaming up victim fantasies where his political opponents would decry diet Mountain Dew as \"racist.\"\n\nVance has tried to undermine the \"weird\" allegations by dismissing them as juvenile bullying, unworthy of his response.\n\n\"My best guess -- this is just a total guess -- is that her campaign is run by a lot of 24-year-old social media interns who maybe were bullied in school and so now they've decided they're going to do the same thing,\" Vance said during a podcast appearance. \"They're going to take that attitude of the middle school social scene and try to run a campaign on it... I just don't think most Americans buy it or care.\"\n\nRegardless of the thoughts of \"most Americans,\" the attacks have apparently gotten under Vance and Trump's skins. The former president responded to the attacks with a very strategic \"no, you are\" response and insisted that he isn't weird.\n\n\"They're the weird ones,\" Trump said during a podcast appearance. \"Nobody's ever called me weird. I'm a lot of things, but weird I'm not and I'm up front, and he's not either, I will tell you, JD is not at all, they are.\"\n\nVance being \"weird\" or a \"phony\" are subjective judgements about the man, but polling has also indicated that the Ohio senator is deeply unpopular with the American voters.\n\nTrump's running mate has the lowest favorability rating of any VP pick immediately after the party convention since the 1980s, with a net negative favorability of -6 points, according to CNN. In recent years, the average for a VP nominee has been +18 points at this stage.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flop (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Accountability_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Accountability Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Longwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Longwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_Psaki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jen Psaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/31/20/SEI215026795.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1365, "textEnd": 1372}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The events will also feature \"everyday Americans\" who have been impacted by the Biden administration's policies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance will follow Harris to Detroit and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. On Thursday, Vance will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nVance is looking to shrug off a rocky start since Trump picked him as his vice presidential nominee last month.

'Cat Ladies' And The Childless: VP Candidate's Views Explained As Wife Defends Comments", "body": "The wife of GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Monday defended comments her husband made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as \"childless cat ladies\" who don't have a \"direct stake\" in the country's future -- which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nIn comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his \"childless cat ladies\" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were \"obviously ... a sarcastic comment\" and he has \"nothing against cats,\" but defended his broader views. \"People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,\" Vance said.\n\nVance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as \"Project 2025.\" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for \"encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years\" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending \"LGBTQ equity\" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and \"replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,\" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, \"The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop.\" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks \"there's some good ideas in there\" and \"there's some things that I disagree with.\"\n\nVance's comments denouncing \"childless cat ladies\" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston attacked Vance's comments in an Instagram post saying she \"truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States\" telling Vance, \"I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\" Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a \"proud mom\" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. \"To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,\" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,\" referring to her brother. \"I love my three parents,\" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.\n\nHow Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.\n\nTrump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Harris, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with CNN reporting he is the least-liked vice presidential nominee post-convention since 1980, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz, her newly named running mate, were set to take the stage in Philadelphia, Ohio Sen. JD Vance held an event of his own in the City of Brotherly Love where he slammed the nascent Democratic ticket as the wrong choice for America.\n\nVance blasted Harris as a \"disaster as vice president,\" seeking to blame her for both wars in Ukraine and Gaza and \"chaos in the world financial markets\" -- though the stock market rallied back Tuesday after suffering its worst day in two years on Monday -- and told supporters that \"we have got to kick her out of the United States government\" rather than \"give her a promotion.\"\n\nThe Ohio lawmaker took questions from reporters after introducing two speakers who sought to tie addiction and crime to the Biden administration's immigration policies -- one woman who lost her daughter to an accidental overdose, another who said her brother \"battles with addiction\" and blamed Democrats for exacerbating the fentanyl crisis and crime in Philadelphia. (A report from the Center for American Progress from June found that Philadelphia is seeing the largest decline in gun violence this year among all major American cities.)\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nHe also sought to contrast his willingness to speak to members of the media to that of Harris, a line of attack from Republicans since she began seeking the Democratic presidential nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside.\n\n\"For 16 days and counting, the American media has been unable to ask her a question,\" Vance said. \"Now, agree or disagree with me and [former] President [Donald] Trump, nobody would dispute that. We will go anywhere, and we will talk to anyone, and we will answer any question.\"\n\nVance called Walz's record as governor \"a joke\" and called him \"one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government at any level.\" He also expressed concern that Democrats might \"pull a little switcheroo on us\" when it comes to the Minnesota governor being on the ticket, echoing comments Trump has previously made about Harris when he waffled on debating her last month.\n\n\"I think that a lot of us are asking ourselves, well, it's not going to be official until the Democrats actually nominate him, I guess, at their convention next week,\" the Ohio lawmaker said, making similar comments later in his question-and-answer session when asked if he'd be willing to debate Walz.\n\n\"I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz, but I want to debate him ... after he's actually officially the nominee,\" Vance said, noting that he called the Minnesota governor to congratulate him earlier in the day. The Ohio senator recounted to reporters earlier Tuesday that he left a voicemail where he said, \"'Look, congratulations. Look forward to a verbose conversation. And enjoy the ride.'\"\n\nVance also sought to paint Walz as a \"San Francisco-style liberal\" and sought to blame him for the rioting that took place in Minneapolis during the 2020 racial injustice protests after the murder of George Floyd by police officers in 2020.\n\n\"Look, would it shock me if Democrats pulled another switcheroo?\" Vance asked. \"No, it wouldn't. So look, we're going to wait until they actually nominate Kamala Harris and Tim Walz before we do any debates. And then, of course, we want to have a robust debate, again, because we believe the American people have the right to have their political leaders try to persuade them.\"\n\nHe went on to accuse Harris of running a \"basement campaign,\" a reference to criticisms of Biden's successful 2020 presidential campaign during the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, before accusing her of being \"afraid\" of sitting for an interview.\n\n\"If she's too afraid of the American media, how is she going to deal with [Russian President] Vladimir Putin and [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and a bunch of world leaders all over the globe?\" Vance asked.\n\nHe also accused Democrats of forcing Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a running mate finalist, of having to \"run away from his Jewish heritage\" (Shapiro, who quickly praised Walz, is set to speak at the Democrats' event later Tuesday) before lobbing a litany of attacks on both Harris and Walz on a range of issues, from immigration to clean energy, manufacturing jobs and transgender rights.\n\nWhen asked for similarities between himself and Walz, Vance replied: \"We're white guys from the Midwest. I guess there are similarities there.\"\n\nVance is taking part in a blitz of battleground states that largely mirrors the multi-state tour that Harris and Walz are embarking on, also visiting Michigan and Wisconsin on the same days as the Democratic duo. The vice president is also set to Arizona and Nevada later this week. (Harris has postponed trips to North and South Carolina due to the impact of severe weather from Tropical Storm Debby; it's unclear if Vance will postpone those as well.)\n\nTrump only has one event planned in the coming days, a point Harris and Democrats have been quick to point out, a rally in Bozeman, Montana, set for Friday evening.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news",

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close -- and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nHere are stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns.\n\nAs political scientist Joshua Holzer noted, the U.S. Constitution has only a few references to the vice presidency.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as -- or replace -- the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks -- Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 -- resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he privately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters. But people close to Trump call the 39-year-old Vance the new heir to Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nWhat can be concluded from Trump choosing Vance?\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate -- and the competition that preceded it -- are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nEditor's note: This story is a roundup of articles from The Conversation's archives.\n\nHoward Manly is the race + equity editor at The Conversation.", "source":

JD Vance hit Philadelphia on Tuesday to kick off a multiday tour of critical swing states -- stressing that unlike Vice President Kamala Harris, he is looking to speak to the press.\n\nHarris has not done an extended interview with any major news outlet since President Biden dropped out of his re-election race and endorsed her to replace him as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nShe has responded to some shouted questions during her travels but has had very few unscripted moments.\n\n\"Kamala Harris, our border czar, is asking the American people to make her the next president of the United States,\" Vance said during a campaign event. \"And yet, for the past 16 days and counting, the American media has been unable to ask her a question.\n\n\"Now agree or disagree with me and President Trump: Nobody would dispute that we will go anywhere and we will talk to anyone,\" the Ohio congressman said.\n\nHarris announced her own swing-state tour before Vance, and both are scheduled to hit many of the same election hot spots: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. Harris is also traveling to Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nVance is labeling his swing as a media tour, while Harris will deliver remarks alongside her newly picked VP candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n\"She is running a basement campaign where she refuses to go before the free press and actually answer their questions,\" Vance said at his rally. \"Well, what kind of election can you have if your own presidential candidate won't actually answer the tough questions?\"\n\nBiden had the fewest press conferences in modern presidential history and was often shielded by his staff to not take questions from reporters at his White House events.\n\nVance spent his time speaking about the open-border policies of the Biden-Harris administration and brought in speakers from Pennsylvania to share their stories of how drugs brought across the border have negatively impacted their families.\n\nRally attendees who The Post spoke to - such as Dorett Jackson, 65, and Dawn Rhodes, 62 - said they were in Philadelphia to hear Vance speak about his policies.\n\n\"We know what we've seen on television. You know he's a senator. We know all of that and his background, but we wanted to hear him actually express his views and see what he's going to talk about today to this crowd,\" Jackson said.\n\nBrian Shine, 46, works at a golf club in Phoenixville, Penn., about an hour northwest of Philadelphia, slammed Walz's record during the George Floyd riots in 2020.\n\nShine said he attended Tuesday's event to support Vance after learning his story from watching \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" the Netflix movie based on a 2016 memoir Vance published about his life growing up in a struggling, working-class Appalachian family.\n\n\"I watched the movie, and it really touched me. And yeah, just being in recovery myself for four and a half years, he knows what it's like,\" Shine said, referring to Vance experiencing his mom's struggles with drug addiction and mental issues.\n\n\"He saw it firsthand with his mom,\" Shine said. \"He knows what it's like for the average American, just trying to survive in this economy, and it's damn near impossible.\n\n\"I'm working two jobs, and I can barely make ends meet,\" the Pennsylvania man said. \"I've been priced out of housing like it. It's impossible to buy a house; it's impossible to go on vacation. It's impossible to live the American dream. We put America last with Biden Harris, and it's not fair. It's not right.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to an inquiry from The Post.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\n1. What do vice presidents actually do?\n\nAs political scientist Joshua Holzer noted, the U.S. Constitution has only a few references to the vice presidency.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\n2. Do no harm\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\n3. Trump's choice\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he privately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nBut people close to Trump call the 39-year-old Vance the new heir to Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nWhat can be concluded from Trump choosing Vance?\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nEditor's note: This story is a roundup of articles from The Conversation's archives.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Vance will talk immigration and the economy in south Philly for first Pa. campaign stop * Pennsylvania Capital-Star", "body": "In his first visit to Pennsylvania as former President Donald Trump's running mate, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) is set to address Philadelphia voters Tuesday on economic issues and immigration reform.\n\nVance, who built his brand on his working-class upbringing in rural Appalachia, was touted as a vice presidential nominee whose story would resonate with voters in rust-belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nWith Pennsylvania considered a must-win for either party, the Trump campaign said it would \"park\" the first-term senator in Pennsylvania for the final months of the campaign.\n\nIn an announcement of his appearance Tuesday at a south Philadelphia entertainment venue, the campaign said Americans are suffering because of inflation, crime and illegal immigration it attributed to the Biden-Harris administration's \"woke and dangerously liberal policies.\"\n\n\"In weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' America, families are struggling to afford the basics and stay safe,\" the Trump campaign said in the announcement.\u202f\"The people of Pennsylvania are feeling the effects of Border Czar, Kamala Harris' crisis first-hand. Democrats in Pennsylvania have essentially put out a welcome sign for illegal immigrants to live in their state and are prioritizing ludicrous programs for them.\"\n\nHow J.D. Vance went from 'Hillbilly Elegy' to being tapped as Trump's 2024 running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to speak at Temple University's Liacouras Center arena Tuesday evening. Vance's schedule for this week closely tracks Harris' with both set to speak in Wisconsin and Michigan later this week.\n\nTrump lost his reelection bid in 2020 by a 64% margin in Philadelphia, although he won more than a dozen precincts in traditionally working-class south Philly as well as other parts of the city.\n\nHarris' campaign said Monday that Vance's appearance was unlikely to smooth things over with Philadelphia voters.\n\n\"Philly voters rejected Trump in 2020 because he failed them as president, presiding over record-high unemployment, overseeing all-time high levels of gun violence in Philly, and sending uninsured rates soaring while giving massive handouts to billionaires and big corporations,\" the campaign's Pennsylvania spokesperson Jack Doyle said in a statement.\n\nDoyle added that Pennsylvania voters will reject the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 plan, which is described as a deeply conservative plan for the transition to a second Trump administration. Vance has worked to distance himself from the 1,000 page document and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the last week after the Associated Press reported Vance had authored the foreword to Robert's upcoming book \"Dawn's Early Light.\"\n\nTrump has claimed that he has nothing to do with Project 2025 and doesn't know its authors, but CNN reported at least 140 people who worked in Trump's first administration were involved in the document's production.\n\nVance, a venture capitalist and author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a memoir of growing up with a troubled family in small-town Ohio, emerged into politics as a vocal critic of Trump. Vance described himself in 2016 as a \"Never Trump\" guy and the former president as \"cultural heroin\" for offering empty promises to solve the nation's problems.\n\nBy the time Vance ran for U.S. Senate in 2022, his views had evolved enough to overcome suspicion among members of his party and earn the support of national GOP groups that bankrolled his campaign. He defeated Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and vaulted beyond his freshman status in the Senate as an ardent advocate for Trump's policies in Congress.", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pennsylvania Capital-Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_hall@penncapital-star.com", "name": "Peter Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Here's what to know.", "body": "Vance is making his first trip to Philadelphia since joining the Republican presidential ticket last month alongside former President Donald Trump.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris won't be the only candidate on the presidential ballot visiting Philadelphia Tuesday.\n\nSen. JD Vance of Ohio, Donald Trump's running mate, is traveling to Philadelphia Tuesday for the first time since he became the GOP vice presidential nominee last month.\n\nVance has had a rocky start to the campaign, dogged by past comments critical of women with no children -- \"childless cat ladies,\" as he described them -- and of Trump, whom he previously referred to as a \"moral disaster\" and \"reprehensible.\" The Hillbilly Elegy author switched his position on Trump during his Senate run and has apologized for his previous remarks about him, telling Fox News in 2021, \"I regret being wrong about the guy.\"\n\n\"I've always had great respect for him and for the other candidates, too,\" Trump said of Vance during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists last week. \"Historically, the choice of the vice president makes no difference. You're voting for the president. And you can have a vice president who's outstanding in every way -- and I think JD is, I think that all of them would have been -- but you're not voting that way, you're voting for the president.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's running mate during the 2016 and 2020 elections, isn't supporting the former president after having refused to go along with a plan to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nVance's comments will come just hours before Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to attend rally at the Liacouras Center at Temple University Tuesday evening, where she's expected to speak around 5:30 p.m.\n\nVance is attending an event at the 2300 Arena on South Swanson Street in South Philly. The entertainment venue, which often hosts wrestling, boxing, and MMA events, seats about 2,000 people.\n\nDoors are scheduled to open at 10:30 a.m., with Vance slated to speak at 11:30 a.m., according to people invited to the event.\n\nWhile the Secret Service doesn't provide the routes for obvious reasons, there will likely be rolling closures on I-95 Tuesday as Vance travels between the airport and South Philly.\n\nPolice said drivers can expect delays and closures in the immediate vicinity surrounding Vance's event in South Philadelphia, but his visit isn't expected to disrupt traffic too much.\n\nPhiladelphia won't be the only city where Vance and Harris appear on the same day.\n\nAccording to Politico, Vance is planning to trail Harris and her campaign across several battleground states this week. On Wednesday he'll follow Harris to Detroit and Eau Claire, Wis., followed by a trip to Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday.\n\nThat remains unclear, especially with Harris still mulling over potential running mates.\n\nA vice presidential debate had been scheduled to take place at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Sept. 25, but the event was canceled.\n\nThere might not be another presidential debate, either. Trump backed out of a debate on ABC that, prior to Joe Biden dropping out of the race, had been scheduled for Sept. 10. In its place, Trump proposed a debate on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania that would involve a live audience.\n\n\"I'll be there on September 10, like he agreed to,\" Harris wrote on social media. \"I hope to see him there.\"\n\nTrump's public schedule is pretty empty this week.\n\nThe former president's next rally is scheduled to take place Friday in Bozeman, Mont., with Trump scheduled to speak at 10 p.m. Eastern (8 p.m. local time).\n\nTrump won Montana by 16 percentage points in 2020, but his visit is aimed at boosting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Jon Tester. Trump made four stops in Montana in 2018 to campaign for Rep. Matt Rosendale, who lost to Tester by 3.5 percentage points, or about 17,000 votes.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

De la Garza acquiesced and the pair shared a quick toast before taking their respective swigs. \"This is the good stuff here,\" Vance said. \"High caffeine, low calorie.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent weeks that Vance has referenced Mountain Dew during public appearances, and it's been done with enough emphasis that the phrase has trended with his name alongside words like \"couch\" and \"dolphin.\" However, the tonal mismatch of segueing from a story about a family member's coma to a soda tasting is notable and leads one to ask: Why is JD Vance being so weird about Mountain Dew?\n\nThe short answer to that question takes us back to July, when Vance put on his first stand-alone rally as former President Donald Trump's 2024 running mate. While on stage, Vance attempted to bond with the crowd by delivering a joke about how liberals are too easily offended and quick to point out what they perceive to be racist behavior.\n\n\"Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,\" he said. \"I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist too.\"\n\nVance then held for applause, which, aside from a few scattered claps, didn't come. The joke bombed and other politicians, including those eying a spot as Kamala Harris' potential 2024 vice presidential pick, quickly jumped on the awkwardness.\n\nFor instance, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear appeared on CNN the day after the rally to discuss Vance's perceived shortcomings, including the fact that he reportedly referred to Trump as \"the next Hitler\" behind closed doors, but was now publicly supporting him. Beshear also simply described Vance's Mountain Dew comments as \"weird,\" questioning who actually drank the beverage (he later apologized for this characterization, though notably only to Diet Mountain Dew -- not to Vance).\n\nUnderpinning both Vance's rally joke, and the broader response to it, are questions about whether Vance is actually as much of an everyman as he says he is, specifically when it comes to what he says are his Appalachian roots. While Vance wrote \"Hillbilly Elegy\" -- a stereotype-packed book that award-winning Appalachian writer and Duke University professor Mesha Maren describes as having \"eugenics-tinged genetic arguments that stain the text\" -- many in the Appalachian region don't want to claim him.\n\nSome of this is based on geography; reportedly, the New York Times standards desk sent an email out in July to reporters cautioning them to avoid referring to Vance as a \"son of Appalachia\" because of this.\n\n\"It's natural to think that someone who wrote a memoir entitled 'Hillbilly Elegy' is from Appalachia,\" the memo read. \"But there is an official government definition of Appalachia, and it's quite expansive running all the way from counties in Mississippi to counties in New York State. And even by that expansive definition, Middletown, Ohio, where Vance grew up, is not Appalachia.\"\n\nHowever, some of the hesitation from those in the region about Vance is rooted in something deeper -- a sense that he doesn't actually understand them. To them, Vance's portrayal of Appalachian in both his book and on rally stages feels like an outsider's perspective, oversimplifying the complexities and resilience of their communities. They argue that his lens of individual responsibility overlooks systemic issues and the strong sense of solidarity that binds them together. For these Appalachians, Vance's account does not resonate with their lived experiences or reflect the nuanced, multifaceted reality of life in the region.\n\nGov. Beshear put it plainly in the same press conference where he apologized for dunking on Mountain Dew. Of Vance, Beshear said: \"Let me just tell you, JD Vance ain't from here.\"\n\nMountain Dew, however, has become a neon-hued cultural symbol in the region.\n\nOriginally created in Tennessee as a whiskey mixer (its name a wink to the term for homemade moonshine) the soda was heavily marketed for decades in rural and working-class communities throughout Appalachia and the American South at large. As a result of this, it has both suffered being characterized as a lower-class indulgence, while also being celebrated for its flavor and pop culture ubiquity.\n\nIt makes sense that Vance would want to associate his name with the beloved, if occasionally ridiculed, brand -- though his current strategy obviously isn't working.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\nAs political scientist Joshua Holzer noted, the U.S. Constitution has only a few references to the vice presidency.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\nRead more: Kamala Harris has tied the record for the most tie-breaking votes in Senate history - a brief overview of what vice presidents do\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nRead more: Veepstakes have evolved from where you live to who you are - which way will Harris turn to balance the ticket?\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he privately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nRead more: JD Vance's selection as

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nVance plans to follow Harris for three days and across four swing states as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns with her running mate, according to Politico. The rollout is especially important for Harris as she became the party's standard-bearer less than a month ago following President Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race.\n\nThe Ohioan is set to trail Harris in Philadelphia; Detroit; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Raleigh, North Carolina. And while Vance won't be headlining rallies, he'll be holding media appearances in the cities alongside voters critical of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nAt first glance, Vance's trip may not seem like a high-stakes effort.\n\nBut it's a gamble.\n\nIn recent months, former President Donald Trump had been leading Biden in most major national polls. And Vance's vice presidential selection was seemingly aimed not at drawing in swing voters -- who had been souring on Biden -- but on firming up the Republican base.\n\nBut Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris' ability to quickly rally the party around her caught the GOP by surprise. And it sapped any real bump that could have resulted from last month's Republican National Convention.\n\nIn recent days, Harris and Trump have been locked in a close race in national and swing-state polls, with the vice president pulling ahead in some of the surveys.\n\nEnter Vance, who wants to halt any sort of sustained momentum for Harris as she stumps with her eventual vice presidential pick.\n\nWhen Harris appears in key battlegrounds this week, Vance will be there to attack the Democratic ticket on local news and bring out conservative voters to sharpen criticism of Biden's record on issues like the economy and immigration. The senator is seemingly aiming to get ahead of the news cycle to blunt a potential Democratic vice presidential honeymoon period.\n\nSince joining the GOP ticket last month, Vance's rollout has been a rocky one.\n\nVance already had a national profile due to his best-selling 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" But before Vance was elected to office in 2022, he made a raft of controversial statements, and during one notable interview, he deemed some Democratic Party leaders to be \"childless cat ladies\" who didn't have a stake in the country's future.\n\nVance's past remarks and MAGA-aligned views on issues like Ukraine (he opposes US funding for the conflict) haven't been a hit with voters. He boasted a minus-5-point favorability rating after the GOP convention. Last month, CNN reported that Vance had a double-digit unfavorable rating with voters in a group of Midwestern states that included his native Ohio.\n\nSo Vance's plan to lay into Harris and her running mate will be a tricky balancing act. He doesn't have the highest standing with voters right now, and if Harris taps either Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she'll have an executive by her side with real appeal among working-class voters.\n\nVance will be looking to draw attention to the GOP ticket when Americans will naturally want to learn more about Harris' running mate.\n\nIt'll be a huge fight for attention during a time when Harris could receive another polling bump based on the selection.\n\nRepublicans have sought to depict Harris as too liberal for the country and have pointed to her San Francisco Bay Area roots to make their case.\n\nBut that argument thus far has not proven to be effective with voters.\n\nA vice presidential pick like Shapiro or Walz -- who are both seen as mainstream Democratic choices -- could throw cold water on some of the attacks over Harris' ideology.\n\nVance will surely hammer Harris over her past support for more liberal proposals on healthcare during her 2020 presidential campaign. But Harris now has a record as part of the administration, and she can point to populist achievements like capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for many Americans on Medicare.\n\nSome voters will applaud Vance's shadow tour of Harris' vice presidential rollout, while others will view it as a stunt. Either way, Vance's itinerary shows that Democrats have all the momentum right now, and Republicans are doing whatever they can to stop it.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.com", "name": "John L.

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nKamala Harris has tied the record for the most tie-breaking votes in Senate history - a brief overview of what vice presidents do\n\n2. Do no harm\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nVeepstakes have evolved from where you live to who you are - which way will Harris turn to balance the ticket?\n\n3. Trump's choice\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he\n\nprivately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nJD Vance's selection

Vance Is 'Weird,' Hate His 'Cat Lady' Attack on Kamala Harris", "body": "If Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) was hoping that the backlash to his public disdain for childless women was isolated to the hyper-online, op-ed reading left, he underestimated how badly he screwed up.\n\nAccording to a new University of Massachusetts Amherst survey, the results of which were provided exclusively to Rolling Stone, 51 percent of Americans strongly disagree with the idea that Kamala Harris not having biological children hinders her ability to serve as president. The number jumps to 64 percent when one includes those who somewhat disagree with the statement. Only 10 percent of respondents, 11 percent of parents, and 15 percent of Republicans agree with this sentiment.\n\nAnd the poll suggests Democratic messaging efforts are working: When respondents were asked to provide a word that describes Vance, one of the top answers by far was \"weird.\"\n\nIn his short stint as former President Donald Trump's running mate, Vance has drawn a firestorm of criticism for complaining that America is being run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies, who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made,\" while referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, who has two stepchildren through her marriage to Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nVance has not withdrawn the statement but has instead attempted to strike a sloppy balance between doubling down and moving the goalposts. In an interview with former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, Vance was asked about his past comments and offered a weird joke: \"I've got nothing against cats. I've got nothing against dogs.\" He added: \"People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said, and the substance of what I said, Megyn, I'm sorry, it's true.\"\n\nIn an interview last week, Trump defended Vance's comments without endorsing them, saying that Vance \"thinks the family experience is a very important thing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more of Vance's past unsavory commentary continues to be unearthed.\n\nThe senator has suggested that people without children should be punished with higher taxes, and that parents should get additional votes representing their children to more heavily influence elections.\n\nAs previously reported by Rolling Stone, Vance urged the right to \"go to war against the anti-child ideology that exists in our country.\" And he argued a national abortion ban is necessary to stop people from traveling across state lines for abortions. Otherwise, liberal donor George Soros will send commercial airliners daily \"to Columbus to load up disproportionately Black women to get them to go have abortions in California,\" Vance said, predicting that \"the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity.\"\n\nAll this, combined with viral -- false -- rumors surrounding Vance's sexual desires for couches have created a decidedly negative impression of the potential VP among voters.\n\nThe UMass Amherst's survey results were notable not only because of the clear backlash to Vance, but because, according to UMass Poll director Tatishe M. Nteta, it found \"even Republicans, Trump voters, and conservatives disagreeing with Vance's viewpoints.\"\n\nGiven the unpopularity of Vance's position,\" Nteta said, \"it is no wonder that Vance and the Trump campaign have been furiously trying to walk back Vance's comments, but the damage may already have been done.\"\n\nThe UMass Poll results contained even more bad news for Trump regarding Vance, whom Democrats have taken to calling \"weird\" as part of their campaign messaging strategy. The survey asked respondents to give one-word descriptions of Vance -- without any priming -- and created a word cloud using the results. The two largest words: \"unknown,\" right next to \"weird.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Since then both Democrats and the Harris campaign have pushed an online effort to label Vance and Trump's campaign as \"weird\" due to his conservative views.\n\nSpeaking about the interview, Fox & Friends co-host Steve Doocy said to Earhardt: \"I want him to explain what the dorky habits he has are, did she explain?\"\n\nEarhardt replied: \"She hesitated. I asked: 'What are the dorky interests that he has?' And she hesitated and said: 'He's going to kill me for saying this, it's Magic: That Gathering, which was a card game. And some of the guys on set know about it. It's similar to Pokemon, that's so popular now. And his boys are into Pokemon.\"\n\nVance recounted on the Full Send podcast that when Trump called him to offer the role as his running mate, the lawmaker's seven-year-old son was trying to talk to him about the Pokemon character Pikachu. Vance told his son: \"Shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu. This is the most important phone call of my life. Please just let me take this phone call.'\"\n\nThe revelation that Vance is still into Magic: The Gathering is a new one, but he was open about the fact that he had played the game as a kid in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy.\n\nIn the book he wrote: \"I could never tell my dad that I played a nerdy collectible card game called Magic, because I feared he'd think the cards were satanic - after all, kids at the church youth group often spoke of Magic and its evil influence on young Christians.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainsley_Earhardt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ainsley Earhardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Doocy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Doocy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pikachu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vance.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Members of the crowd were holding signs that read, \"Lyin' Kamala you're fired!\" but the first two words were in a lighter color and a smaller font, making them less visible from a distance.\n\nThe signs are a reference to Trump's catchphrase while on \"The Apprentice.\" Vance also recently said Kamala Harris, currently vice president, should be \"fired\" and replaced with Trump, although it's not clear what he meant.\n\nThe crowd was likely holding the signs in support of Vance. One clip, viewed 2 million times on X, formerly Twitter, shows a man raising his sign as Vance discussed Harris.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton called us deplorables, and now Kamala Harris says we're weird. Well Kamala, let's talk about some things that are weird,\" Vance said as the man pointed his sign at his head.\n\nProducer and screenwriter Bill Hanstock posted an image of the moment on X, formerly Twiter, commenting, \"Handing out YOU'RE FIRED signs to people standing behind vance is a democrat-level unforced error.\" The post received more than 3.5 million views.\n\nMany anti-Trump viewers seemed amused by the visual and the implication that Trump supporters appeared to inadvertently imply Vance should be fired.\n\nIt comes after weeks of doubt over the Ohio senator's suitability as Trump's running mate. Not long after he was announced, old controversial comments resurfaced around women and abortion rights and some speculated that he could hurt Trump's chances of winning the election.\n\nStill, Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, said the former president was \"thrilled with the choice he made with Senator Vance, and they are the perfect team to take back the White House.\"\n\nVance has been contacted for comment by Newsweek.\n\nWhen Trump selected Vance as his VP, it was thought to be an effort to court evangelical Christian voters and energize white, working-class voters, who had helped Trump secure his victory in 2016. This was due to the attention he grabbed after publishing his book \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which detailed his blue-collar upbringing.\n\nWhile describing growing up in Middletown in his book, Vance describes poverty as a \"family tradition\" for many people and that substance use problems and domestic violence were commonplace, meaning hopes for a better economic future were in short supply - situating him as an \"everyday man,\" with some saying the book \"captures life perfectly.\"\n\nVance's ratings coming out of a convention were the lowest recorded since 1980 at -6 net in polling ratings, matching CNN's senior political data reporter Harry Enten's comment that Vance is \"historically unpopular\" as a running mate.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_laws@newsweek.com", "name": "Jasmine Laws", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue-collar worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middletown, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middletown, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442852/jd-vance-atlanta-youre-fired.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b5e3542b5c0f5154a0c4c24e69afb2fc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

And still he retains enough voters to be a decent bet for reelection.\n\nIt turns out, however, that Trump's Teflon superpower isn't transferable. In the two weeks since he picked as his running mate JD Vance -- Trump's MAGA Mini-Me in just about every respect -- Vance has been on the defensive for comments he made before and since becoming Ohio's junior senator just 19 months ago. By now you know the ones I mean -- remarks about the \"childless sociopaths\" of the ruling class, a.k.a. Democrats, and specifically \"childless cat ladies\" led by none other than Kamala Harris, now the likely Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIt's been a disastrous debut, polls confirm: Vance is the least liked vice presidential choice in five decades, and the first with a net-negative approval rating.\n\nYet here's what's interesting: Trump is on the defensive for Vance's inanities, too. It's a most unfamiliar stance for him. Had Trump made the cat lady crack, it would probably have been soon forgotten, following all his other insults, idiocies and lies into a memory hole. Trump doesn't explain his outrages -- when you explain, you're losing, the political truism goes -- and he never apologizes. (Which is likely why the sycophantic Vance has only doubled down, with smarmy asides about how he's \"got nothing against cats\" that exacerbate and prolong the catty controversy.)\n\nYet there was Trump on prime-time Fox News Monday evening, the misogynist in chief answering to an otherwise fawning Laura Ingraham for the misogynistic bro-talk of his potential veep. \"He loves family,\" Trump defended and explained. Well, Ingraham asked, what do you say to women without children? \"I think they understand it,\" Trump replied meekly.\n\nYes indeedy. And so do their friends and family, men and women alike. Just not in the way Trump implies.\n\nPerhaps Trump's Teflon not only isn't transferable, it's been nicked and scratched. Perhaps, by choosing Vance as his wingman, he's finally being held accountable, by proxy, for the outrageous discourse he's modeled. After all, Vance only started spouting stupidities after he decided to seek political office and needed Trump's support. To that end, the Yale Law grad, Silicon Valley investor, best-selling author and former Trump critic morphed into right-wing culture warrior and Trump lickspittle.\n\nMetamorphosis: I met the former Vance in early 2017 when he came to the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics to promote his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" He genially fielded questions from David Axelrod, the institute's founder, before a large audience. Afterward a few of us went to dinner. I mostly recall that Vance was no fan of the newly inaugurated Trump and that he plainly contemplated running for office as a Republican. As a fellow native of Ohio's working class, I came away thinking that Republicans in our home state would be lucky to have such a self-made, independent-minded pragmatist return as a candidate, and an antidote to Trumpism. Ha.\n\nVance's now-infamous cat-lady tirade reveals his cringey transformation -- and his sweeping judgmentalism masquerading as fact and deep-thinking:\n\n\"We're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made. And so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact,\" he said. \"You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\n(Buttigieg would announce just weeks afterward that he and his husband had adopted newborn twins, after repeated failed attempts at adoption.)\n\nAs it turns out, Vance's comments, made to then-host Tucker Carlson on Fox News in 2021, were only the latest in a long line of specious societal critiques in speeches and writings dating from his book's publication in 2016, critiques that grew increasingly nasty and partisan as Vance advanced in Republican politics. In fact, Carlson said he invited Vance on his show because the Senate candidate had made a speech the previous week assailing \"the childless left.\"\n\nAfter the show, Vance promoted his comments in fundraising emails. \"Fighting back won't be easy -- our childless opponents have a lot of free time,\" he snidely wrote in one. In his attacks against the allegedly anti-family Democrats, Vance typically labeled them \"sociopaths\" and named Harris as the lead avatar. Fact check: Harris years ago became a stepmom to her husband's two children, and no less than his ex-wife, their mother, attests to Harris' co-parenting cred.\n\nThat Vance's record of lambasting childless cat ladies is years long, not just a throwaway line to like-minded Carlson, suggests one of two things: Either Trump knew the record and saw no problems there, or his veep vetters missed it.\n\nWhichever it is, here's the good news: Finally Trump is having to answer for abhorrent remarks, even if they're not his own, and potentially paying a political price. We can hope.", "source": {"uri": "yorkdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "York Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki",

Walz visited the city for the first time last month, while Vance lived there for years.", "body": "Sen. JD Vance said Kamala Harris chose a \"running mate who will be a San Francisco-style liberal.\" But Gov. Tim Walz hadn't even visited the city until last month. Meanwhile, Vance lived there for years, working as a venture capitalist.\n\nDuring his first public remarks since Vice President Kamala Harris chose Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio hit his new opponent as a \"San Francisco-style liberal.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris is running as a San Francisco liberal,\" the vice presidential candidate told reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday. \"She has governed as a San Francisco liberal, and she's chosen a running mate who will be a San Francisco-style liberal.\"\n\nBut while Harris' political career did begin in the Bay Area, including a seven-year stint as San Francisco District Attorney from 2004-2011, Walz has spent virtually no time in the city. In fact, his first time visiting the city was last month.\n\n\"Last week was my first time in San Francisco,\" Walz said on an episode of \"The Ezra Klein Show\" released on August 2. \"That is the most beautiful city I've ever been in.\"\n\nWalz said that he had been in San Francisco for meetings, and had taken a jog in the city's \"Presidio\" neighborhood. The Minnesota governor said the city was \"exotic\" to him, bemoaning that it had been \"demonized.\"\n\nMeanwhile, after Vance graduated law school in 2013, he moved to San Francisco, where he eventually began his career as a venture capitalist. Vance even wrote about his time in the city in an Atlantic essay in 2016 where he denounced his now-running mate, Donald Trump, and compared his appeal to that of opioids.\n\nA few Saturdays ago, my wife and I spent the morning volunteering at a community garden in our San Francisco neighborhood. After a few hours of casual labor, we and the other volunteers dispersed to our respective destinations: tasty brunches, day trips to wine country, art-gallery tours. It was a perfectly normal day, by San Francisco standards.\n\nHe moved back to Ohio, where he grew up, in 2017. Vance has since made several trips back to the city, including for a fundraiser for Trump last week.\n\nVance also described Walz on Tuesday as \"one of the most far left radicals in the entire United States Government at any level\" and hit him for his response to the 2020 riots in Minneapolis after the murder of George Floyd, saying he \"let rioters burn down\" the city.\n\nBut the relatively general and all-purpose nature of the opening attacks -- \"San Francisco\" is a relatively common buzzword that Republicans use to hit Democrats -- reflects a campaign that's still scrambling to adjust to a suddenly changing ticket.\n\nIn fact, Vance even suggested that Walz may not actually be Harris's running mate, alluding to President Joe Biden's recent decision to withdraw from the race.\n\n\"First of all, the reason I didn't say a whole lot about Tim Walz is because the Democrats have showed a willingness to pull a little switcheroo on us,\" Vance told reporters. \"I don't even know if we're actually going to get Tim Walz out of this campaign.\"\n\nHarris chose Walz on Tuesday over several other contenders, including Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, following a vetting process that lasted roughly two weeks.\n\nVance is set to follow Harris and Walz across several more battleground states this week.\n\nRead the

I guess there are similarities there,\" per the New York Times.\n\nVance also agreed to debate Walz once he secured the official nomination.\n\nWhile Vance has equated abortion with murder, Walz has gone out of his way to make sure abortion is an option for women in his state.\n\nIn 2023, the governor signed a bill codifying the right to abortion in Minnesota, per Politico.\n\nWalz then joined Harris in March at a Planned Parenthood health center, marking it as the first visit by a sitting vice president to an abortion clinic.\n\nDuring the same month, he confirmed his stance saying, \"Abortion is health care. I think old white men need to learn how to talk about this a little more,\" he said on CNN.\n\n\"And I think the biggest thing is, listen to women, listen to what they're saying.\"\n\nVance, however, does not share the same views on the controversial subject.\n\nTrump's running mate has previously stressed how important he views abortion.\n\n\"Abortion was the first political issue I can ever remember caring about, and even after 20 years, it still shocks me that progressives just ignore there's an innocent life involved,\" he wrote on X in 2021.\n\nVance scored an A+ with the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, because of his record as a Senate, per its website.\n\nHe also said he has \"voted consistently to defend the lives of the unborn and infants,\" per the Washington Post.\n\nIn 2023, Vance opposed Issue 1 on the ballot which would enshrine reproductive rights into Ohio's constitution, per the Washington Post.\n\nThe bill passed in the state with 56 percent of votes.\n\nVance and Walz share a polarizing view on immigration -- Walz hopes to provide undocumented immigrants citizenship while Vance believes in deportation.\n\nWhen Walz was a member of Congress, he was on board for a sticker screening of refugees, however, he shifted his views when he became governor.\n\nIn 2023, he signed a bill that allowed undocumented immigrants to be eligible for Minnesota driver's licenses.\n\nHe argued the bill would make roads safer by reducing unlicensed drivers, per the press release.\n\nWalz doesn't have a clear public record for his views on border policies, per the New York Times.\n\nVance however, has made his views very clear.\n\nHe introduced a bill in 2023 that was intended to crack down on illegal visa overstays, per the Washington Post.\n\nVance has also blamed migration through the southern border for the reason why housing costs have gone up and wages have plummeted in the United States.\n\nOn Monday, Vance said he believes the US should deport the about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, he told Fox News.\n\n\"You start with the most violent people, the people who have criminal records,\" he added that to do this was by making it harder for migrants to get work in the US.\n\nSimilar to his shift in beliefs about immigration, Walz also changed his mind about gun control.\n\nThe governor of Minnesota previously held an \"A\" rating from the NRA, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHowever, after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and the push from his daughter, Hope, to change\n\nAs governor, Walz signed a bill that included universal background checks and a red flag law that makes sure no dangerous person possesses a gun or has to surrender the ones they own.\n\nVance, however, rejected tougher gun laws and has been praised by the National Rifle Association for his views.\n\nIn 2022, he wanted to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives which enforces federal gun laws.\n\n\"Joe Biden's ATF is illegally collecting information on the gun transactions of millions of law-abiding citizens & putting them into a digital database,\" he posted to X.\n\n\"As Senator, I'll not only lead the fight against Biden's unconstitutional gun database, I'll fight to ABOLISH the ATF.\"\n\nVance himself owns a rife and passed the routine background check to purchase it, per ABC affiliate WLWT.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_salamone@the-sun.com",

Vance Irony Alert: Trump And I Are For People 'Who Play By The Rules'", "body": "J.D. Vance Irony Alert: Trump And I Are For People 'Who Play By The Rules'\n\nDoes coup-supporter J.D. Vance know he's the running mate of a felon, sexual predator and fraudster? Weird!\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance sat for a softball interview with Trump worshiper and sycophant Maria Bartiromo yesterday.\n\nYou know Vance's candidacy is in trouble because Bartiromo's first question to him was, \"[S]ome people are saying you were the wrong pick for Trump's running mate, what are you doing about it?\"\n\nVance dubiously claimed he takes the criticism as a badge of honor and as proof that he is feared by the media and the left. He went on to say that he \"grew up as a poor kid,\" and not from a political or from a wealthy family. He just forgot to mention - and MAGA Maria let it slide - that he's extremely wealthy now and is invested in a platform that promotes neo-Nazi and Russian propaganda. His entry into politics was greatly helped by billionaire Peter Thiel. In fact, Thiel and his billionaire tech-bros were probably instrumental in Vance becoming Trump's running mate. You can best believe the bros will glom even more power than they currently have should Vance accompany their favorite felon back into the White House.\n\nUnfortunately for the bros and the Trump campaign, Vance is historically unpopular. And maybe Bartiromo helped shore him up with her viewers but I doubt he helped himself with any others.\n\nFor one thing, Vance had some very weird trouble with facts. He falsely claimed Vice President Kamala Harris \"opened up the American southern border.\" (Fact check: Harris was never assigned to work on the border but to work on diplomacy with Latin American countries on the root causes of migration.) Of course, Bartiromo did not correct the smear.\n\nThen Vance ridiculously blamed the high cost of housing on Harris and immigrants.\n\nVANCE: I was in Georgia yesterday. They have a terrible housing affordability problem in the state of Georgia, Maria, because Kamala Harris shot interest rates through the roof, and then she welcomed in millions of illegal aliens to compete with Americans for scarce homes.\n\nLots has been written about the reasons for the lack of affordable housing in the U.S. but I could find none that cited immigrants. Not even via Fox News.\n\nBartiromo is supposed to be a business journalist but she let that falsehood go.\n\nThen Vance got to a kneeslapper of falsehoods:\n\nVANCE: The other thing that, Maria, that Kamala just seems to have no real compassion or understanding for is that the worst inflation is in the price of groceries, Americans cannot afford to put the same kind of food on the table they could when Donald Trump was president. That is an unbelievable tragedy. No American family should be worried about putting food on the table. And yet going to the grocery has become a source of stress for middle-class Americans all across our country.\n\nDonald Trump and I just want to what people who work hard and play by the rules to have a good life. We don't want to give Medicare to illegal aliens. We don't want illegal aliens to take advantage of our system. We want the American economy to work for hardworking Americans.\n\nVance is so full of crap here. For one thing, his claim to have compassion for middle-class family is belied by his voting record. The Center for Economic and Policy Research published this yesterday, the same day Vance was pretending to care about those who don't have a billionaire sugar daddy.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would expand the Child Tax Credit -- the very policy that Vance has championed and just accused Kamala Harris of opposing. Vance didn't show up for the vote. Killing the proposal was a loss to roughly 16 million children in low-income working families, who would have benefited from about $700 in tax relief this year. Estimates from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities show that the proposal would have lifted at least 500,000 children above the poverty line and raised the family incomes for at least 5 million more poor children.\n\nNeither he nor Bartiromo said a word about the Child Tax Credit here.\n\nFurthermore, Project 2025's tax plan gives a big tax cut to the wealthy (like Vance and Thiel) and makes the middle class pay for it. There's also a MAGA plan to raise the retirement age for Social Security, thus making those hard-working Americans work longer and harder, cut benefits for nearly three-quarters of Americans and threaten low- and moderate-income workers with economic insecurity once they leave the workforce, as per the Center for American Progress.\n\nThen there's Vance's claim that he and Trump are on the side of \"people who work hard and play by the rules.\" For one thing, Trump is notoriously lazy. But more importantly, he could not care less about rules. Vance's idea of an upstanding American was recently convicted of 34 felonies, adjudged to have sexually abused and defamed E. Jean Carroll, was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for defrauding insurers and lenders in New York, was caught bragging on video about grabbing women by the p***y, and has been charged with dozens more felonies for stealing classified documents and trying to incite an insurrection.\n\nAnd let's not forget, Vance has said he was all for Trump's 2020 coup attempt.\n\nYou've probably guessed that Bartiromo uttered not a peep of challenge here, either.\n\nYou can watch Bartiromo help spread disinformation below, from the August 4, 2024 Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.", "source": {"uri": "newshounds.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsHounds"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

A Data for Progress poll shows that 79 percent of voters, including 78 percent of independents, think that \"insulting women and couples who don't have children\" is a \"weird\" thing for a political figure to say. Voters also agree that Republicans are \"weirder\" today than they were 10 years ago by a margin of 26 points.\n\nSpeaking to MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, Quinn suggested that Vance has been making off-putting statements for years to help his political career in Ohio.\n\n\"I wish we had come up with the word 'weird' because it is so appropriate for what he's saying,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"I don't think we're surprised at all at the statements that are coming out now because of the way Ohio works. I don't know if people realize that more than 70 percent of this state is not registered in a political party.\n\n\"So when it comes to the party primaries, it's a very small percentage of people that make that selection, and it has turned the primaries into just a competition to be the most outrageous.\"\n\nQuinn suggested that all the Republican Ohio Senate hopefuls were saying \"outrageous\" things in order to get the backing of Trump in the primary race.\n\n\"Now, everybody's looking at what he said and going, 'Man, that is way out there, it's weird,' but it's what you had to do in the party primary to get elected,\" he said.\n\n\"If we had open primaries in Ohio, [Vance] wouldn't have won. The center of Ohio would never have chosen him to be on the final ballot, but the small group of people now that are picking the candidates are as fringe as you get, so you've got to make \"cat lady\" comments to get on the ballot.\"\n\nVance has previously denied the suggestion that he is weird, saying he is a \"pretty normal guy. I've got a wife and kids, and I like to hang out and watch football. And I care about this stuff because I care about the country.\"\n\nIn an interview on the Full Send podcast, Vance suggested that the attack line comes from Harris' \"24-year-old social media interns who maybe were bullied in school and so now they've decided they're going to do the same thing.\"\n\nElsewhere, Quinn said that Trump picking Vance as his running mate may damage the GOP ticket's 2024 chances in Ohio.\n\nFor decades, Ohio was considered a bellwether state that was able to correctly pick the overall winner of the presidential elections. However, this run ended in 2020, when Trump retained Ohio but lost the election to President Joe Biden.\n\nOhio is considered a red state that Trump will win in November, although Quinn suggests it could now be in play for Harris.\n\n\"Trump wasn't a felon when he ran before. Now he is, and people in Ohio, in the center, pay attention to things like that, and it could be that they just don't want to vote for him or Vance,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"I think a lot comes down to who is the vice presidential candidate, and can Harris keep this momentum going,\" Quinn added.\n\n\"She's clearly energizing people, including in Ohio cities which mattered for Obama, but can you get that personable vice presidential candidate to be the contrast to the weird JD Vance?\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name": "Ewan Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolle_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicolle Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellwether", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellwether"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443719/jd-vance-georgia.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6832ede1609bf1ddfd407c9608497996", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\nAs political scientist Joshua Holzer noted, the U.S. Constitution has only a few references to the vice presidency.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he privately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nRead more:", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz is no different.\n\nWell known for attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as \"weird,\" Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA moderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining, national polls suggest the race is very close - and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.\n\nThose references spell out that \"the Vice President shall become President\" if the president becomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.\n\nBut as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789, only 301 tiebreaking votes have been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.\n\n\"Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as - or replace - the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,\" Holzer wrote. \"This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.\"\n\nJohn Adams, the first U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He once complained to his wife that the vice presidency was \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.\"\n\n2. Do no harm\n\nAs a scholar who studies American politics, Philip Klinkner has explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. \"Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\nWith a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn't whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.\n\n\"The worst picks - Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 - resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,\" Klinkner wrote.\n\n3. Trump's choice\n\nKaryn Amira is a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.\n\nSince Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it's been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as \"morally reprehensible\" and \"cultural heroin,\" and he privately compared him to Hitler.\n\nBut the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known that he would support Trump for president in 2024 and now says that he would not have readily certified the 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence's shoes.\n\nAs Amira pointed out, Vance doesn't represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.\n\nSince 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. \"The choice of Vance as Trump's running mate - and the competition that preceded it - are the latest steps in this process,\" Amira wrote.\n\nEditor's note: This story is a roundup of articles from The Conversation's archives.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) speaks during a campaign rally with Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump at the Georgia State University Convocation Center on August 03, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nWhile filming a Newsmax segment about the dangers of fentanyl crossing the southern United States border last week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance shared a story about his own mother's drug overdose and said \"there are millions of Americans who could have a second chance with their loved ones if we make smarter decisions.\"\n\n\"I know what it feels like when we make dumb decisions and people suffer,\" Vance said, seconds before a member of the Newsmax crew handed both him and host Bianca de la Garza bottles of Diet Mountain Dew. \"Yes you do, firsthand,\" de la Garza replied.\n\n\"Should we toast here?\" Vance asked as he unscrewed the plastic cap from the bottle. De la Garza acquiesced and the pair shared a quick toast before taking their respective swigs. \"This is the good stuff here,\" Vance said. \"High caffeine, low calorie.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent weeks that Vance has referenced Mountain Dew during public appearances, and it's been done with enough emphasis that the phrase has trended with his name alongside words like \"couch\" and \"dolphin.\" However, the tonal mismatch of segueing from a story about a family member's coma to a soda tasting is notable and leads one to ask: Why is JD Vance being so weird about Mountain Dew?\n\nThe short answer to that question takes us back to July, when Vance put on his first stand-alone rally as former President Donald Trump's 2024 running mate. While on stage, Vance attempted to bond with the crowd by delivering a joke about how liberals are too easily offended and quick to point out what they perceive to be racist behavior.\n\n\"Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,\" he said. \"I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist too.\"\n\nVance then held for applause, which, aside from a few scattered claps, didn't come. The joke bombed and other politicians, including those eying a spot as Kamala Harris' potential 2024 vice presidential pick, quickly jumped on the awkwardness.\n\nFor instance, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear appeared on CNN the day after the rally to discuss Vance's perceived shortcomings, including the fact that he reportedly referred to Trump as \"the next Hitler\" behind closed doors, but was now publicly supporting him. Beshear also simply described Vance's Mountain Dew comments as \"weird,\" questioning who actually drank the beverage (he later apologized for this characterization, though notably only to Diet Mountain Dew -- not to Vance).\n\nUnderpinning both Vance's rally joke, and the broader response to it, are questions about whether Vance is actually as much of an everyman as he says he is, specifically when it comes to what he says are his Appalachian roots. While Vance wrote \"Hillbilly Elegy\" -- a stereotype-packed book that award-winning Appalachian writer and Duke University professor Mesha Maren describes as having \"eugenics-tinged genetic arguments that stain the text\" -- many in the Appalachian region don't want to claim him.\n\nSome of this is based on geography; reportedly, the New York Times standards desk sent an email out in July to reporters cautioning them to avoid referring to Vance as a \"son of Appalachia\" because of this.\n\n\"It's natural to think that someone who wrote a memoir entitled 'Hillbilly Elegy' is from Appalachia,\" the memo read. \"But there is an official government definition of Appalachia, and it's quite expansive running all the way from counties in Mississippi to counties in New York State. And even by that expansive definition, Middletown, Ohio, where Vance grew up, is not Appalachia.\"\n\nHowever, some of the hesitation from those in the region about Vance is rooted in something deeper -- a sense that he doesn't actually understand them. To them, Vance's portrayal of Appalachian in both his book and on rally stages feels like an outsider's perspective, oversimplifying the complexities and resilience of their communities. They argue that his lens of individual responsibility overlooks systemic issues and the strong sense of solidarity that binds them together. For these Appalachians, Vance's account does not resonate with their lived experiences or reflect the nuanced, multifaceted reality of life in the region.\n\nGov. Beshear put it plainly in the same press conference where he apologized for dunking on Mountain Dew. Of Vance, Beshear said: \"Let me just tell you, JD Vance ain't from here.\"\n\nMountain Dew, however, has become a neon-hued cultural symbol in the region.\n\nOriginally created in Tennessee as a whiskey mixer (its name a wink to the term for homemade moonshine) the soda was heavily marketed for decades in rural and working-class communities throughout Appalachia and the American South at large. As a result of this, it has both suffered being characterized as a lower-class indulgence, while also being celebrated for its flavor and pop culture ubiquity.\n\nIt makes sense that Vance would want to associate his name with the beloved, if occasionally ridiculed, brand -- though his current strategy obviously isn't working.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Appalachia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_Mountain_Dew", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diet Mountain Dew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mountain Dew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Kamala Harris is too afraid to answer media questions and cannot lead us in these troubled times.\"\n\nVance's planned appearances are press availabilities, not rallies. That allows Vance to keep playing his role as attack dog, slamming Harris while Donald Trump busies himself with other things, like endearing himself again to deep-pocketed Wall Street titans. Trump and Vance are scheduled to appear together again on Friday night at a rally in Bozeman, Montana -- a rare event in a state that may be competitive at the Senate level.\n\nThe campaign releases announcing Vance's press conferences attacked Democrats over high prices, Monday's stock market downturn, crime and illegal immigration.\n\n\"Hard-working Americans are suffering because of the Harris-Biden Administration's woke and dangerously liberal policies,\" one read. \"Prices are excruciatingly high, cost of living has soared, crime has skyrocketed, and illegal immigrants are pouring into our country.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) accused Vice President Kamala Harris of being pressured into choosing dark horse Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro - saying she \"bent the knee\" to the far-left of the party.\n\nWalz is one of the \"most far-left radicals in the entire United States,\" Vance said, arguing that Harris chose him to \"fit the needs of the far-left of the party.\"\n\n\"She selected Tim Walz - a guy who wants to ship more manufacturing jobs to China, who wants to get an illegal aliens driver's license, and who wants to make the financial crisis ... so much worse because he refuses to do his job and actually make it easier for American citizens and non illegal aliens to live a good life,\" he said.\n\nVance also said Harris' selection of Walz proved that the current veep \"is running as a San Francisco liberal,\" accusing the Minnesota governor and native Nebraskan of being California-minded.\n\n\"To her credit, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to make an interesting team because if we remember the rioting in the summer of 2020, Tim Walz was the guy who let rioters burn down Minneapolis and then Kamala Harris was the one who bailed the rioters out of jail,\" he said, referencing the aftermath of George Floyd's death there.\n\nVance also answered a question from The Post about how he feels about his opponent being Walz - whom the Republican accused of having a \"joke record\" - over the far more well-known Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was reportedly Harris' second choice.\n\n\"I genuinely feel bad that for days, maybe weeks, [Shapiro] actually had to run away from his Jewish heritage because of what the Democrats are saying about [him,]\" Vance told The Post. \"I think that's scandalous, disgraceful - [regardless of] whatever you believe or whatever disagreements on policy you have about somebody.\"\n\n\"The fact that that race - the vice presidential race on the Democratic side - became so focused on his ethnicity, I think it's absolutely disgraceful, and it's insulting to Americans, whatever background you're from,\" Vance added.\n\nThe remarks came after far-left groups formed in the weeks Harris was deliberating her running mate called Shapiro \"Genocide Josh\" for his support for Israel. It served as a nod to the nickname \"Genocide Joe\" that anti-Israel protesters gave President Biden.\n\nShapiro was reported as being a top candidate under Harris' consideration and the final decision is reported to have been between the battleground governor and Walz, who was not one of the top contenders voters expected to get the nomination given his geography.\n\nDemocratic insiders have told The Post that Harris' snub of Shapiro was more to do with her fear that the ambitious Pennsylvania governor would steal her \"spotlight.\"\n\nAs for the Trump-Vance campaign, the GOP VP nominee argued that they will focus on Harris - not Walz.\n\n\"We're gonna run against Kamala Harris because she's the problem and she's the one asking to be the president of the United States,\" he said, noting the she has not done an unscripted interview since replacing Biden on the top of the ticket.\n\nWalz and Harris will make their first appearance together later Tuesday in Pennsylvania.\n\nVance said he would \"absolutely\" debate Walz - but only when the governor is officially nominated at the DNC convention in Chicago later in August, in case the Democrats want to switch him out.\n\nVance event attendee Brian Shine, 46, slammed Walz's record during the George Floyd riots in 2020 in a brief interview with The Post.\n\n\"I remember when they had an off-cuff report with him, he said Minnesota was nothing but rocks and cows. And he has a disdain for the average Joe,\" said Shine, who works at a golf club in Phoenixville, Pa. \"He has a disdain for the middle class, the working class in America.\"\n\nWalz is credited for starting the \"weird\" attack against Vance that has grown popular in the Democratic Party.\n\nShine said of the \"weird\" attack: \"I don't know what's weird about a man who, like JD, who married a great woman, had three wonderful kids. What's weird about that that's perfectly normal. I know that several years ago, he became a Catholic. Welcome aboard. By the way, he knows what faith and hope and country are all about. He served his country in the Marine Corps. What's weird about that?\"\n\n\"Walz's idea of normal is men having babies. His idea of normal is importing 12 million illegals and letting cities burn to the ground. That's his idea of normal. That's not normal; that's abnormal and gross,\" Shine said.\n\n\"It's this radical left agenda that, it just doesn't work. It doesn't work. Socialism never worked in this country. It never worked anywhere, everywhere. It's tried, it's failed,\" he added, noting that he doesn't \"like a single thing\" about him Walz.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

Both men were picked for their supposed appeal in the industrial midwest, as both campaigns sought an effective message-bearer in states like Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nBut Vance's ascension to the presidential ticket has yet to net the Trump campaign any positive results. As Democrats scrambled to respond to a disastrous debate performance from Joe Biden in late June, the Republican presidential nominee picked an Ohio senator with less than two years' worth of experience in the job and a litany of his own political baggage to join the GOP ticket. Now, with Harris roaring back into contention in every swing state poll, the incumbent president and his running mate both are eager to blunt Harris's momentum while recapturing some of their own.\n\nThey are seemingly hoping that a line of attack against Walz and Harris both as \"far-left\" will be what does it. Echoing the concern-trolling from #NeverTrump Republicans who have joined the right flank of the Democratic Party as well as some conservative Democrats worried that the party is insufficiently vocal about its support for Israel, Trump's allies have begun attacking Harris for picking Walz over Josh Shapiro -- the Pennsylvania governor was the target of criticism from progressives who took issue with a college essay in which he wrote that \"Palestinians will not coexist peacefully\" with Israelis and would attempt to \"ruin\" any chance at a peace deal.\n\nThose attacks are getting ugly very quickly. Falling back on a crutch the GOP has used now for decades, Vance dipped his toe into Islamophobia on Tuesday as he responded to a question from a reporter at his event in Philadelphia. In front of the crowd, he declared that Harris had \"bent the knee\" to the \"Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is running as a San Francisco liberal, she has governed as a San Francisco liberal, and she's chosen a running mate who will be a San Francisco-style liberal,\" Vance added.\n\nFor months, allies of former President Donald Trump have used such Islamophobic language to describe both the Israeli assault in Gaza and the response from protesters in the US to the Biden administration's continued financial and military support for it. Trump himself has described both Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the latter of whom gave a Senate floor speech calling for new elections in Israel and the removal of Benjamin Netanyahu, as \"becom[ing] Palestinian\", seemingly using the ethnic group as a slur.\n\nBut Tuesday's comments from Vance are a sign that the Trump campaign may make the Democrats' internal hand-wringing over support for the Israeli military a greater campaign issue in the months ahead, while aiming other attacks at Walz aimed at concocting an image of a far-left politician that replaces the reality of Walz's fairly middle-of-the-pack Democratic voting record. Trump echoed Vance's attacks in a Truth Social posting, calling the Democratic ticket \"the most Radical Left duo in American history\".\n\nOther Trump allies have signalled that Walz's handling of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests which devolved into riots in the city of Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd will be another issue that Republicans use to attack the Minnesota governor. Walz has batted away such criticism in interviews and vowed to defend his record as governor.\n\nVance and Trump, meanwhile, remain under the spectre of a label describing them as \"weird\" which Walz and other Democrats have been pushing as the Ohio senator tries to explain the intent behind his comments from 2021 attacking childless Americans and claiming they have less of a \"stake\" in the future of the country.\n\nThe former president was even seemingly doing some wishcasting Tuesday afternoon following the announcement of Walz as Harris's running mate, and suggested on Truth Social that Walz may not be on the ticket at all.\n\n\"What are the chances that Crooked Joe Biden, the WORST President in the history of the U.S., whose Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him by Kamabla, Barrack HUSSEIN Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Shifty Adam Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and others on the Lunatic Left, CRASHES the Democrat National Convention and tries to take back the

Sick But True", "body": "I have a theory. It's a theory which makes complete sense to me and it fits the facts, so let me run it past you and you see if you feel the same way. Trump got down to the three VP picks, which were Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance. Trump had had the opportunity to pick a woman, Elise Stefanik was salivating for the role. The day will come, if it hasn't already, when she will thank God on bended knee that she wasn't chosen. Kristi Noem likewise was salivating. Nikki Haley would have probably taken the gig if offered it. And of course there was Tim Scott, abasing himself (and possibly even marrying) for nothing and Byron Donalds. But Vance caught the brass ring.\n\nAnd then he proceeded to take that brass ring and turn the 2024 election into a circus. Vance was anointed July 15. It hasn't even been one month yet and he's already the laughing stock of the internet and the subject of memes. The word \"weird\" and \"weirdo\" is way up in the Google search engines, due to his antics. So why did Trump pick him?\n\nI'm going to tell you. Trump picked him because he needs a surrogate out there on the campaign trail because -- follow me closely now -- because he can't go out and campaign because he's too damn old and worn out! That's why. Just look at the facts. Trump is not out campaigning like he used to in 2016 or 2020. Nowhere near it. If you ask him he would probably say, like he says about why he wouldn't debate in the primaries, \"everybody knows me.\" Maybe they do. But there's still a lot to be said for that hands on touch, plus, and this is key -- Trump loves nothing more than the adrenaline rush of the screaming MAGAs. It fills his empty soul. Or used to. Now, he flat out doesn't have the energy to get to a rally and when he does get there, it's the same old tired schtick.\n\nSo Trump picked Vance to go out there and be a Mini Mi version of Trump, without being threatening. Trump owns Vance. Vance, on his own, couldn't get anywhere. Trump's endorsement got him in the Senate two years ago. And that is Vance's entire political career, two years. And Trump has four so wow, between them, they've got six years and Kamala Harris had six years under her belt how many decades ago?\n\nBut I am convinced that I'm right. Let me show you Exhibit \"A\", from PoliticusUSA.\n\nIt appears @JDVance is being sent to campaign nearby most, if not all, of the events @KamalaHarris and her running mate will hold this week.\n\nThe only campaign event on @realDonaldTrump's schedule is a campaign rally in Montana on Friday.\n\nKamala Harris will be campaigning in eight swing states in five days. Donald Trump will be in zero. As noted previously by this newsletter, Donald Trump has barely been campaigning since the election cycle started. This isn't the Donald Trump of 2016, who traveled the country frequently and held events in swing states and elsewhere. In 2024, Trump would rather spend the week at his club, venture out for a 90-minute campaign rally, and then go home.\n\nRepublicans don't want to talk about it, but they have to see it, unless they're comatose and catatonic. Donald Trump is fading and he physically can't keep up with Kamala Harris. However, his invisibility on the campaign trail is not the only place where Trump is fading. The numbers also show that Donald Trump is fading.\n\nThe numbers are the poll numbers. But I agree with this argument. Vance is out there in the same states for side by side comparison, maybe, except Vance is the VP candidate. And as such, he's expected to pull his weight in bringing home the election, granted. But he's not just pulling his own weight, he's pulling his own and Trump's 300+ pounds of dead weight.\n\nAnd that is not the way to win an election. I am dead certain on some level Trump knows this. But he flat out does not have the energy to campaign. Remember a rally that Trump canceled at the last minute, claiming bad weather? It was April 20, in North Carolina, you may recall. There was always something suspicious about that. It was speculated at the time that jury selection had worn Trump out. That was happening in April.\n\nTrump fell asleep in court. Trump fell asleep at the Republican convention. Trump put everybody else to sleep with his acceptance speech. The old guy doesn't have it anymore. All that he can do is play golf.\n\nAnd he KNOWS that. And here is the tragic, Faustian bargain. Donald Trump does not want to be president. He never did. He figured he would increase the value of his \"brand\" found Trump TV, etc. And then like the dog catching the car, he had it but he didn't know what to do with it. And now he HAS to run for president. Again, I quote Maureen Dowd, \"He's running to run the country that he tried to overthrow when he ran it before because he's running from the law.\" That's the only reason he's running at all.\n\nAnd J.D. Vance has been pulled in as the understudy of this mad carnival show. It's all a gamble. And it's already a gamble that is not paying off. Vance is weird. He's not helping Trump's cause but Doug Burgum is not MAGA and Marco Rubio would have used the experience to campaign for 2028. You know it, I know it, and Trump knows it.\n\nAnd the same can be said of Stefanik, Noem, and Haley, Haley especially. Stefanik and Noem would have done the MAGA pitch but again, they're women and Trump hates women.\n\nSo that's Trump's *secret.* Except it's becoming more and more obvious. Trump is going to go down in history again, as the candidate who did the least campaigning and chickened out of debates. And then there's his beloved wife and is she on the trail like Doug Emhoff?

Vance's Backdrop Makes It Look Like He's Campaigning for 'Kamala'", "body": "The unfortunate signage gaffe came on the same day Harris announced her VP pick.\n\nJ.D. Vance delivered a rally speech Tuesday in Pennsylvania with a backdrop that made it appear he was campaigning for his arch nemesis, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe unfortunate signage appeared to stem from the event's advance team not accounting for its crowd blocking half of a gigantic poster that sat directly behind Vance, which appeared to read in full, \"KAMALA CHAOS.\"\n\nFor those watching on Fox News and other broadcasts, however, the only words clearly visible -- in white text on a blue background, in all caps -- was simply \"Kamala.\"\n\nThe apparent gaffe quickly went viral on X, where many joked that Harris' VP choice in Tim Walz, which was announced just prior to Vance's rally speech, had convinced Trump's running mate to switch teams.\n\nWhile the backdrop may have been confusing to someone watching Vance's speech on mute, the Ohio Senator made clear in his statements that he's still no fan of the vice president he once suggested was a \"childless cat lady.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris has been such a disastrous vice president of this country that everywhere she goes, chaos and uncertainty follow,\" he said, leaning into what his backdrop's full text read.\n\nIt appears the Trump campaign may be attempting to link Harris to the word \"chaos\" in the same way Democrats, starting with Walz himself, began characterizing Trump, Vance, and the MAGA movement as \"weird.\"\n\nWHYY, a local NPR station in Philadelphia, reported that Vance's rally had about 200 attendees, which included local Republican leadership from around Philadelphia. Fox 29 reported that Vance said he \"genuinely\" feels bad for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro after he didn't get the VP nod, claiming he distanced himself from his Jewish faith in recent weeks.\n\n\"I genuinely feel bad that for days -- maybe even weeks -- the guy actually had to run away from his Jewish heritage,\" Vance said. \"I think that's scandalous and disgraceful.\"\n\nVance's rally turnout is expected to be much less than a later event by Harris and Walz, which is expected to have an estimated 10,000 in attendance in the same city, campaign officials said.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance has had many of them", "body": "When it comes to Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance's name, it's complicated.\n\nThe senator from Ohio introduced himself to the world in 2016 when he published his bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" under the name J.D. Vance -- \"like jay-dot-dee-dot,\" he wrote, short for James David. In the book, he explained that this was not the first iteration of his name. Nor would it be the last.\n\nOver the course of his 40 years, Vance's first, middle and last names have all been altered in one way or another. After Vance was introduced to voters across the country as Donald Trump's new running mate, his name became the source of both curiosity and questions -- including why he no longer uses periods in JD.\n\nHe was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, on Aug. 2, 1984, his middle and last names the same as his biological father, Donald Bowman. His parents split up \"around the time I started walking,\" he writes. When he was about 6, his mother, Beverly, married for the third time. He was adopted by his new stepfather, Robert Hamel, and his mother renamed him James David Hamel.\n\nWhen his mother erased Donald Bowman from his and her lives, the adoption process also erased the name James Donald Bowman from the public record. The only birth certificate for Vance on file at Ohio's vital statistics office reads James David Hamel, according to information provided by the state.\n\nBeverly kept the boy's initials the same, since he went universally by J.D., Vance explains in the book. He didn't buy his mother's story that he was named for his uncle David, though. \"Any old D name would have done, so long as it wasn't Donald,\" he wrote.\n\nVance spent more than two decades as James David \"J.D.\" Hamel. It's the name by which he graduated from Middletown High School, served in Iraq as a U.S. Marine (officially, Cpl. James D. Hamel), earned a political science degree at the Ohio State University and blogged his ruminations as a 26-year-old student at Yale Law School. Those facts are borne out in documentation provided by those entities upon request, or otherwise publicly available, and were confirmed by campaign spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk.\n\nBut the situation gnawed at him, particularly after his mother and adoptive father divorced.\n\n\"I shared a name with no one I really cared about (which bothered me already), and with Bob gone, explaining why my name was J.D. Hamel would require a few additional awkward moments,\" he writes in \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" \"Yeah, my legal father's last name is Hamel. You haven't met him because I don't see him. No, I don't know why I don't see him. Of all the things that I hated about my childhood, nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.\"\n\nSo he decided to change his name again, to Vance -- the last name of his beloved Mamaw, the grandmother who raised him.\n\nIt didn't happen on his wedding day in 2014, as the book implies, but in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale, Van Kirk said. It felt right to take the name of the woman who raised him before dying in 2005, as he was putting the struggles of his early life behind him and launching into this new phase.\n\n\"Throughout his tumultuous childhood, Mamaw -- or Bonnie Blanton Vance -- raised JD and was always his north star,\" Van Kirk said in a statement. \"It only felt right to him to take Vance as his last name.\"\n\nClaiming the Vance name also served to tie JD more clearly to what he writes was \"hillbilly royalty\" on his grandfather's side not long before he would release a book opining on hillbilly culture. A distant cousin to his Papaw, also named James Vance, married into the McCoy-hating Hatfield family and committed a murder that \"kicked off one of the most famous family feuds in American history,\" Vance wrote in his book.\n\nVance achieved a clean slate of sorts with his new name, just as he was entering his career as a lawyer and author. Besides being the name on his book, it's the name he used to register for the bar, to marry, to enter the world of venture capital in Silicon Valley and as he became a father.\n\nBut there was one more name alteration to come.\n\nWhen Vance jumped into politics in July 2021, he had removed the periods from J.D.

At an event in Nevada, he called her a \"wacky San Francisco liberal.\"\n\nMr. Trump, meantime, has just one stop scheduled this week -- a rally in Montana, where he has endorsed Tim Sheehy, a businessman and former Navy SEAL, who is attempting to unseat Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat who was elected in 2006.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_c_bender@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael C.

Josh Shapiro, likely caving to their antisemitic left. But in that choice perhaps to hold onto the left and maybe Michigan, they may have just given away the state they really need -- Pennsylvania -- that they pretty much have to have to win, given the current estimates.\n\nThis choice may not go over well in the other Rust Belt states. They picked a guy who compared socialism to neighborliness and talked dismissively about the red states as being full of \"rocks and cows.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Here Are the Damning Tim Walz Comments the GOP Should Run on a Loop\n\nOpinion: Walz Sidelining Shapiro Shows the Antisemites Have Won\n\nJD Vance went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Tuesday to campaign and he had some killer responses on the selection of Walz. He let two women speak first on how the Biden-Harris failure at the border so harmed their families. Then at about 12:51, Vance spoke and blasted that failure of leadership. He does a great job from there to the end, and it's all fun.\n\nHe spoke about how Harris had failed to do an interview for 16 days since she was given the presumptive nomination on a silver platter, and he pressed the media to hold Kamala accountable. He said she was \"running a basement campaign\" and asked the press to \"show a little bit of shame\" for not digging deeper.\n\nThe first question he was asked after his remarks in Pennsylvania was about Walz and a potential debate, and he pointed out that given the machinations that the Democrats have pulled, we wouldn't really know if Walz wouldn't be switched out again, as Joe Biden was, until the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThen Vance pointed out how radical Walz was, saying he thought his selection meant that \"Kamala Harris had bent the knee to the far left of her party, which is what she always does.\" He said given she was a \"San Francisco liberal,\" it made sense that she picked someone in a similar vein.\n\n\"To her credit, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do make an interesting team,\" Vance said.\n\n\"Tim Walz was the guy who let rioters burn down Minneapolis, Kamala Harris was the one who bailed the rioters out of jail.\"\n\nHe said he and Trump were willing to go anywhere to convince people to vote for them. But if Harris wasn't going to even answer questions, then how would she be able to deal with hostile leaders across the globe? He said that was the minimum you should do if you sought the office.\n\nVance said he also thought it was disgraceful what the Democrats did to Josh Shapiro, saying they were treating his being Jewish as something wrong, and that was scandalous. He said he thought that was \"insulting to Americans.\"\n\nVance went through a litany of Walz's issues and then called him the \"double-down choice of failed leadership\" and that choice was on the head of Kamala Harris. \"She's fundamentally a radical herself, and she wanted a partner in crime.\"\n\nHe was asked about ending the wars in Israel and Ukraine, and he outlined how Harris had failed there as well, prolonging the war by not giving/supporting Israel's ability to fully finish off Hamas. As far as Ukraine, he said you needed a negotiator who Vladimir Putin would respect -- and that wasn't Harris.\n\nVance was asked about his childless cat ladies remark, which he said was a sarcastic remark made even before he ran for the Senate, and a woman in the audience shouted out that she was a childless cat lady who loved him. That sort of killed the question right there. He also said that he was arguing that the government should be more pro-family. But he said if the media wanted to get offended, he was more offended by the grocery prices that people were having to pay. \"I'm offended that Kamala Harris opened up the southern border and allowed fentanyl to come into our communities...I'm offended she wants to be the people's president but wouldn't even answer tough questions.\"", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Harris and the Democratic party do not fully support secure borders, energy independence, respect for law enforcement, parental rights in education, meritocracy, a strong defense, and most recently, an independent Supreme Court.\n\nThey claim the 2020 riots that cost lives and caused billions of dollars in property damage were mostly peaceful, President Biden is \"sharp as a tack,\" institute lawfare against Trump, obsess over climate change, support the failing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Environmental, Social and Governance initiatives, and say men can have babies.

He mentions only two potential Democratic vice president candidates. Uninformed readers would think the Democratic party did not have multiple benches of qualified individuals. Besides the 12 outstanding people being vetted, he ignores the plethora of other superb possibilities.\n\nThe real issue is that the vice president has to be someone with wisdom and experience in domestic and/or foreign policy to step up if the president is incapacitated. That would make the Republican nominee, JD Vance, a non-starter.\n\nVance is getting more \"airtime\" than the presidential nominee - something that must be intolerable to Donald Trump. Don't be surprised if Vance decides to pull out of the race \"for personal reasons,\" so the Republicans could promote a candidate they believe will bring value to the ticket, be able to step up if/when needed, but not take the spotlight off Trump. That eliminates Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott and Doug Burgum, all for various reasons - thank goodness.\n\nWhomever they select, or if Vance remains, no one will match the superstar that Harris selects to be her running mate.

Much worse", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nAs Vice President Kamala Harris continues to keep all of Washington on its toes about which white boy she will select as her running mate, Donald Trump's campaign is dispatching his running mate -- Senator JD Vance of Ohio -- for counterprogramming.\n\nVance will be in Philadelphia on Tuesday, where Harris will make her first appearance alongside her running mate at a rally. Then, Vance will follow her to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, before he trails her to North Carolina.\n\nThe tour serves two purposes: Firstly, it allows for Vance to assume the common role of the running mate as the \"attack dog\" who can hurl javelins that the principal cannot do; secondly, it serves as Vance's reintroduction to the public after a rocky rollout as Trump's number-two.\n\nFew candidates have had a worse rollout than the Ohio freshman senator. Larry Hogan, the Republican former governor of Maryland who is now running for Senate, told The Independent that there is \"no question\" that Vance has a problem with women. Vance's comments about \"childless cat ladies,\" attacks on Jennifer Aniston and other remarks have significantly weakened him. The campaign has had to dispatch his wife Usha to defend his remarks. His previous calling pregnancies from rape and incest \"inconvenenient\" haven't gone unnoticed, either.\n\nAll of this has warranted some political pundits comparing Trump's nomination of Vance to John McCain's selection of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.\n\nThat comparison makes sense to some. Palin's numerous gaffes -- including an interview with Katie Couric that led to Tina Fey doing a dead-on impersonation on Saturday Night Live -- turned her into the ultimate example of how an improperly vetted running mate can drag down an entire ticket. Joe Biden's decisive defeat of Palin in their one vice-presidential debate solidified her image.\n\nIndeed, former San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro posted on X/Twitter this week that \"memories of the Sarah Palin embarrassment loomed large\" when he was vetted by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nBut these comparisons might be unfair -- because as much of a liability as Palin was, Vance might actually be worse. The effect of running mates on the final result tends to cloud judgment. But the key difference between Vance and Palin is that Palin was an unknown quantity, whereas everyone knew Vance's liabilities at the time he was chosen.\n\nIt's important to remember that McCain could not have drawn a worse hand in 2008. A bad economy, disapproval of the War in Iraq and fatigue toward George W Bush made the Arizona Republican's campaign all the more difficult. Conservatives did not trust him because of his co-authoring of a 2007 immigration reform bill with Ted Kennedy. His rhetoric on foreign policy was arguably even more bellicose than that of Bush and then-vice president Dick Cheney's.\n\nAnd, of course, he was running against Obama, whose campaign as an optimistic biracial candidate with a message that he would change the way Washington worked excited many Americans. Obama's selection of Joe Biden -- McCain's friend for decades -- symbolized that Obama knew where he was weak, particularly with white working-class voters.\n\nMcCain needed a boost, and Palin looked like that at the time. She had knocked off an incumbent Republican governor in 2006 and was a fairly popular governor during her year-and-a-half in the position. McCain's decision was also a clear play to win over Hillary Clinton supporters who wanted to see her win.\n\nAs Meghan McCain pointed out last month, Palin received a largely positive reception after her convention speech and for a brief moment, McCain-Palin took a slight lead in the polls. That sugar high ended once the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent global financial meltdown happened. Obama's seemingly calm and sober-minded decision to pick Biden made him seem well-equipped to lead, compared with the risky choice by McCain.\n\nVance did not do any of the things Palin did. Unlike Palin, he severely underperformed the top of the ticket. Indeed, he was trailing behind other Republican candidates when he ran for Senate in 2022 until Trump endorsed him. He also won by a smaller margin in Ohio in 2022 than Trump had won in 2016 and 2020.\n\nSimilarly, Palin only melted down under the bright lights of vice-presidential scrutiny. Vance's comments -- a product of his time as a popular author and a right-wing pundit -- created a massive oppo file for him that made him an easy target.\n\nTrump's decision to pick Vance also shows that he doesn't think he needs to appeal to disaffected Biden voters, but rather would prefer to double down on his own ideology. At last month's convention, right-wing gadfly Tucker Carlson praised the fact that \"Vance has views that are closer to Trump's voters than anyone else in Washington in office. Therefore, he's the vice president.\"\n\nBut that means Trump has done nothing to shore up supporters of Nikki Haley or other moderates. While that may have worked when Biden -- an incredibly unpopular president -- was the Democratic nominee, it left Trump ill-equipped once Harris replaced Biden.\n\nPalin's collapse was swift and her decline from governor to Republican running mate to Masked Singer contestant to failed congressional candidate makes her an easy target. But her collapse came after her selection and she was a gamble that simply didn't pay off. Vance is the sign of an overconfident campaign.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Palin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

In 2022, he was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote.\n\nHis re-elections are often tied to a respectable approval rating. A January 2024 approval rating poll, conducted by local Minnesota news outlet KAAL-TV, found that 55 percent of respondents thought Walz was doing a good job.\n\nWhen another local outlet asked people who Harris should pick as her running mate, 22 percent indicated their governor would be a good choice.\n\nThose numbers are slightly higher than the ones Vance has seen from his state of Ohio - though as a freshman senator, he does not have the same amount of polling information.\n\nVance, a businessman and memoirist-turned-politician, initially won his seat in the Seante in 2022 after obtaining 53 percent of the vote.\n\nThe Hillbilly Elegy author earned notability from his New York Times bestselling memoir, which later spurred a Netflix movie. An enthusiastic endorsement from Donald Trump also helped put his name on the map.\n\nA 2023 survey by Morning Consult found that he had a 44 percent approval rating and 34 percent disapproval rating from voters in his state.\n\nBut voters across the nation seem less passionate about Vance as a vice president candidate. Polling from NPR, PBS and Marist College found that Vance has a 33 percent disapproval rating - a drop from 28 percent when he was first made Trump's running mate.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, which compiles polling from across the nation and creates an average, puts Vance at a 40.6 percent unfavorable rating.\n\nVance has found himself at the center of various strange controversies since becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee - resurfaced anti-abortion comments, inconsistent feelings about Trump and allegations of becoming intimate with a couch may contribute to the public's opinion of him.\n\nFuture polling will indicate how voters may feel about Walz joining Harris's ticket - once the public gets to know the Minnesota governor.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times Best Seller list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9347a8d1ff5de4971e0efd9b59b7c0de", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788439", "eventUri": "eng-9788439", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

But he better hurry because it's been six weeks.\"\n\nSpeculation that Vance wears eyeliner to his public appearances has been rife after a series of images and videos appeared to show a black smudge accentuating his waterline.\n\nPhotojournalist Zach D Roberts shared a photo of Vance taken during a recent speaking engagement, in which a black line was clearly visible under his bottom eyelashes.\n\n\"I really thought people were joking about this, but then I photographed him last week. Vance 100 percent does wear eyeliner,\" Roberts captioned the post.\n\nThe speculation grew so much that it prompted comedian Jimmy Fallon to poke fun at Vance in an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. During the 22 July broadcast, Fallon showed an image of a graph increasing along its x-axis, along with the mocking tagline: \"Google searches for, 'Does JD Vance wear eyeliner?'\"\n\nThe late-night talk show host then cut to a photo of Vance, once again showing a distinct black line under his eyes.\n\nThe Independent's Meredith Clark writes, \"It may be possible that Vance uses eyeliner for live events and TV spots, just like many public figures wear makeup to enhance their appearance on camera. However, the reason why so many people online can't stop talking about Vance's rumoured makeup is because it's 'hypocritical' due to the Republican's staunch anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs.\"\n\n\"We're fine with men who wear makeup.

Just look at social media to understand the economic angst; you'll see plenty of memes flying around showing the difficulty young adults have compared to previous generations with buying houses, cars and child care.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats both see it. One reason Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday chose Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate is because his economic policies have been aimed at workers and families more than at business. They include free lunches for all public school kids and a child tax credit.\n\nThat's also where former President Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been pushing the Republicans.\n\n\"The ideal outcome for the country is if both the Republican and Democratic parties are genuinely competing for working class votes on policy grounds,\" Chris Griswold, policy director of American Compass, told me in a conversation before Harris made her choice.\n\nFormed in 2020, American Compass is small think tank in Washington that influenced several important right-wing politicians, including Vance, to focus on workers and families.\n\n\"Both parties pitching themselves as trying to give workers the best deal, that's an amazing space to be in,\" Griswold added. \"I hope that's where we're headed. That will require the right elements of both parties to win the fights in those respective parties. That remains ongoing.\"\n\nVance and a handful of other GOP members of Congress, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in the last two years challenged the GOP's relentless pursuit of lower taxes, deregulation and free trade. In doing so, they found common ground at times with Democrats and even with the person in government who business leaders fear the most, FTC Commissioner Lina Khan.\n\nTheir efforts at times confused other Republicans, talking heads and journalists. The search began for boxes, containers and labels for these politicians. \"New Right\" and \"neopopulism\" and \"national conservatism\" are all being taken for a spin.\n\nAs different as it is to see more interaction between labor unions and Republicans, so it is to hear Republicans like Vance calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage, aggressive antitrust enforcement and a tax credit to families with children.\n\nVance and this New Right-or-whatever-it-is-called group aren't winning in the GOP, though. Last Thursday, Republican senators blocked a bill to expand the child tax credit. Vance didn't vote.\n\nWalz, in an interview with Ezra Klein of the New York Times last week, said the biggest pro-family move of his time as Minnesota's governor - paid family medical leave for all workers- should be a top goal for a Harris presidency.\n\n\"We're the last nation on earth basically to not do this. It is so foundational to just basic decency and financial well-being. And I think that would start to change both finances, attitude - strengthen the family,\" Walz told Klein.\n\nHe then mentioned his now-opponent's focus on the difficulties workers and families face in declining small towns. Walz said: \"If JD Vance is right about this: that we should make it easier for families to be together, then make sure that after your child's born, that you can spend a little time with them. That'd be a great thing.\"\n\nMinnesota's paid family medical leave program is still in being constructed and won't start until at least 2026. And so, while Walz demonstrated how to get an idea turned into law, voters won't be able to judge him on implementation. Early this year, he told me he gets weekly updates on its progress. Republicans have complained its estimated cost has risen since the legislation passed last year.\n\nThe groups like American Compass and politicians like Vance, with some of their ideas, are challenging fundamental theories in economics. One of them is the idea, called comparative advantage, that nations should produce the goods and services they are best at and buy the rest from others. This approach, they argue, hollowed out the United States' manufacturing base and robbed opportunities from workers.\n\nOne of the knock-on effects was that economic mobility required actual mobility, which played out with Americans leaving small communities for suburbs and cities.\n\n\"The free market fundamentalists, especially on the right, lionized moving for opportunity, as if workers needed to accommodate themselves to what the economy demands instead of policy making sure that the economy is serving what workers want,\" Griswold said.\n\nBoth Walz and Vance grew up in small towns and are veterans. They bring a balance of geography and experience to their running mates, who spent their whole lives in urban areas.\n\nWalz also represented a mostly rural district in Congress. In his 2022 re-election as Minnesota's governor, however, he didn't win any county that lost population during the 2010s.\n\nVance, of course, has his own weaknesses. His stance on social matters, including suggesting that people with children should have more voting power, are so extreme they make it less likely that helpful compromises on economics will materialize.\n\nThe top of the ticket is another matter. Harris is sure to be aligned with Walz's economic views. However, Trump is so unpredictable that no one can be sure he supports Vance's.\n\n____\n\nColumnist Evan Ramstad is a Star Tribune business columnist.\n\n___", "source": {"uri":

After Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the NYT had published only 12 stories in 24 hours.*\n\nThe reverse happened at The Washington Post: 20 stories about Vance and 16 about Walz with four postings each flagged as \"opinion.\" The NYT had only one story flagged \"opinion\" and it was about Walz.\n\nHowever, the NYT continues its practice of presenting opinion/editorial style articles as \"new\". It had only one such story about Trump-Vance but five about Harris-Walz along with one passive voice headline for the fail. And Vance? Three such headlines.\n\nThe New York Times notes that Minnesota would have its first female governor should the Harris-Walz prevail. There is no story about Ohio's potentially open Senate seat. The NYT also features Walz's wife but not Vance's.\n\nGiven the time factor, the WaPo reporting appears (superficially) far more balanced in both content and numbers. It's opinion-masquerading-as-news headlines appear more in the Vance column than the Walz one. But the one is a doozy: \"Almost no one knows who Tim Walz is.\"\n\nTell that to Minnesota and Wisconsin residents. Millions on Twitter/X, Facebook and TikTok. FoxNews. Or the 30% of Americans polled who do know who he is. And maybe, just maybe, that's because he has spent his focus on governing rather than generating headlines. Even with his Trump-like headline style, 43% (+/- 2%) of those polled didn't know Vance when he was nominated.\n\n* Using Google News advanced search for the time period July 15-July 15 (Vance) and past 24 hours (Walz).\n\n~~~~\n\nThe stakes in November have never been more urgent, nor the choices more extreme.\n\nRemember: you are not voting for one person.

If he makes it to the White House, post-9/11 veterans will be represented at the highest levels of government, and someone with first-hand experience in America's Global War on Terror will have the ear of the commander-in-chief.\n\nThat possibility is \"invaluable\" to a generation of veterans who often felt disconnected from the elected officials whose decisions affected ground troops during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n\nOther prominent veterans who served in those wars are speaking out against Vance, as well as the notion that he represents them.\n\nThose veterans -- including retired Marine Corps officers Joe Plenzler and Scott Cooper, as well as Amy McGrath, a former Democratic political candidate from Kentucky and the first woman to fly a combat mission for the Marine Corps -- accused Vance of political flip-flopping and criticized his isolationist stance toward foreign policy.\n\nVance's promotion of unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential election doesn't align with the oath of enlistment and the promise to defend democracy, McGrath argued.\n\nJD Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2003 under the name James D.

He later went on to attend Ohio State University and Yale Law School, change his surname to Vance in honor of his maternal grandparents, work as a venture capitalist, write the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy and eventually become a leading voice in conservatism.\n\nIn addition to being the first post-9/11 veteran on a major-party ticket, Vance will be the first veteran of any generation to appear on a presidential ballot since John McCain in 2008, as well as the first veteran of the military's enlisted ranks to be on the ballot since Al Gore in 2000.\n\nThat representation of veterans on the ballot -- and the perspective an enlisted Marine could bring to the White House -- supersedes politics, Jaslow believes.\n\n\"The idea of war or what it takes to defend ourselves from terrorism is all too often an abstract concept that people want to intellectualize, when in reality, it's something that impacts real human lives ... in ways that are lost on many of the American people in real time today,\" Jaslow said. \"Having a veteran serve in elected office would mean that the men and women whose lives are on the line to defend what we have here at home would be more top of mind than they otherwise would be.\"\n\nLikewise, Elliot Ackerman, a former Marine Corps special operations team leader who has authored bestselling memoirs about his service, views Vance's political ascension as positive, despite Ackerman not agreeing with all of the VP nominee's political beliefs.\n\n\"It should be applauded that we have a veteran running at that level, regardless of what you think about their positions,\" Ackerman said. \"I think it's a good and healthy thing for our democracy that at senior decision-making levels you have individuals who served this country and whose experience is informed by that service.\"\n\nVance is likely paving the way for other post-9/11 veterans to be nominated by a major party, Ackerman added.\n\n\"On the national stage, he's the first at the top of the ticket, and I suspect he probably won't be the last,\" Ackerman said. \"I think that's a good thing for our country.\"\n\nHugh Hewitt, a conservative political commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that Trump likely viewed Vance as key to reclaiming the support from veterans that the former president lost between his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. During the 2020 presidential race, polling showed that older veterans overwhelmingly backed Trump, while younger veterans and women veterans significantly preferred President Joe Biden.\n\nThree weeks after Trump announced his VP choice during the Republican National Convention, it remained uncertain how the pick would affect polling.\n\nIn an Ipsos poll released July 30, 47% of Americans believe veterans make the best elected officials when compared to people with prior public service or those currently working in law enforcement, business, academia or news and entertainment. When it comes to confidence in elected officials, 76% believe that veterans elected to office would make good decisions.\n\nThe poll was based on a sample of 1,238 U.S. residents and conducted on behalf of With Honor Action, a veteran-led group that aims to increase the number of veterans in elected office and foster bipartisanship in Congress.\n\nWhile some veterans view Vance's nomination as a symbolic win for U.S. veterans and service members, others see his rise as a threat to democracy and foreign policy. They also frown upon his alignment with Trump after Vance initially criticized the former president.\n\nUpon Trump's election in 2016, Vance called Trump \"dangerous\" and \"unfit\" for office and said he could be \"America's Hitler.\" By 2021, Vance had reversed his opinion, citing Trump's accomplishments as president.\n\n\"While we share being Marines and from the Great State of Ohio, I'm not voting for him,\" said Plenzler, a former infantry officer and combat veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"His flip flop on the presidential candidate gives me whiplash, and I'm looking for someone with a steadier moral compass.\"\n\nMichael Smith, a former Navy officer and the executive director of Veterans for Responsible Leadership -- a Super PAC comprised of \"Never Trump\" veterans -- said that Vance's military service was honorable, but his support of Trump's antidemocratic views is not.\n\nSimilarly, Cooper, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran who commanded an EA-6B Prowler squadron, criticized Vance for not speaking out against rioters who carried out the insurrection on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nVance has said that unlike former Vice President Mike Pence, he would have used the VP's role to contest the outcome of the 2020 election, which he said was \"stolen\" from Trump.\n\n\"We would hope that those who have served in the military would represent moral courage, a willingness to stand apart from the group, at personal risk, for what is right,\" Cooper said. \"He doesn't represent what I feel deeply about.\"\n\nNaveed Shah, an Iraq War veteran and the political director of Common Defense, a progressive veterans organization, argued that people shouldn't vote for candidates merely because of their status as veterans. Like Cooper, Shah doesn't believe Vance represents the values held by some veterans of his generation.\n\nMcGrath, a veteran political candidate who lost her bid in 2020 to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., likewise said she would support a post-9/11 veteran making it onto a major-party ticket if the person stood for the values that American veterans fought for throughout history. Vance is not that person, McGrath argued.\n\n\"We have veterans who are Republicans, we have veterans who are Democrats, we have veterans who are conservative and we have veterans who are liberal. The red line is democracy itself,\" McGrath said. \"If you're somebody who perpetuates a lie, particularly continuing to say that the last election was unfair, you're basically doing the work of our adversaries. ... That's so disturbing to me.\"\n\nIn particular, McGrath and Plenzler criticized Vance's \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. He would dismantle \"a system of allies and partners\" built by the Greatest Generation and abdicate the country's responsibility to lead on the world stage, they argued.\n\nVance has accused America's NATO allies of not paying for their fair share to support Kyiv, and earlier this year, he joined 14 other Republican senators to oppose an aid package to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nVance has said his military service helped to shape his beliefs on foreign policy. When he enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, Vance believed in the mission of the Iraq War -- a belief he now describes as a mistake. Vance reflected on that time of his life in a speech on the Senate floor in April while arguing against sending aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\n\"I believed the propaganda of the George W. Bush administration that we needed to invade Iraq, that it was a war for freedom and democracy,\" Vance said. \"I served my country honorably, and I saw when I went to Iraq that I had been lied to, that the promises of the foreign policy establishment of this country were a complete joke.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who won the Democratic presidential nomination Monday, chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a longtime member of the Army National Guard, as her running mate, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday morning.\n\nIn addition to Walz, Harris' pool of potential VP picks included Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, an Afghanistan War veteran, and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a former astronaut and Navy aviator.\n\nWalz enlisted in the National Guard in 1981 at the age of 17, and he retired as a command sergeant major in 2005. He later became the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

JD Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona, July 31, 2024. (Jae C. Hong/AP)\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump chose JD Vance as his running mate in July, the moment marked a milestone for veterans who joined the military following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: One of their own would be listed on a major-party ticket for the very first time.\n\nSome veterans believe Vance's ascension is worth celebrating. If he makes it to the White House, post-9/11 veterans will be represented at the highest levels of government, and someone with first-hand experience in America's Global War on Terror will have the ear of the commander-in-chief.\n\nThat possibility is \"invaluable\" to a generation of veterans who often felt disconnected from the elected officials whose decisions affected ground troops during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n\nOther prominent veterans who served in those wars are speaking out against Vance, as well as the notion that he represents them.\n\nThose veterans -- including retired Marine Corps officers Joe Plenzler and Scott Cooper, as well as Amy McGrath, a former Democratic political candidate from Kentucky and the first woman to fly a combat mission for the Marine Corps -- accused Vance of political flip-flopping and criticized his isolationist stance toward foreign policy.\n\nVance's promotion of unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential election doesn't align with the oath of enlistment and the promise to defend democracy, McGrath argued.\n\nJD Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2003 under the name James D. Hamel, the Marine Corps confirmed. He served a four-year enlistment as a combat correspondent and deployed to Iraq with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing from August 2005 to February 2006.\n\nVance left the service in 2007 as a corporal. He later went on to attend Ohio State University and Yale Law School, change his surname to Vance in honor of his maternal grandparents, work as a venture capitalist, write the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy and eventually become a leading voice in conservatism.\n\nIn addition to being the first post-9/11 veteran on a major-party ticket, Vance will be the first veteran of any generation to appear on a presidential ballot since John McCain in 2008, as well as the first veteran of the military's enlisted ranks to be on the ballot since Al Gore in 2000.\n\nThat representation of veterans on the ballot -- and the perspective an enlisted Marine could bring to the White House -- supersedes politics, Jaslow believes.\n\n\"The idea of war or what it takes to defend ourselves from terrorism is all too often an abstract concept that people want to intellectualize, when in reality, it's something that impacts real human lives ... in ways that are lost on many of the American people in real time today,\" Jaslow said. \"Having a veteran serve in elected office would mean that the men and women whose lives are on the line to defend what we have here at home would be more top of mind than they otherwise would be.\"\n\nLikewise, Elliot Ackerman, a former Marine Corps special operations team leader who has authored bestselling memoirs about his service, views Vance's political ascension as positive, despite Ackerman not agreeing with all of the VP nominee's political beliefs.\n\n\"It should be applauded that we have a veteran running at that level, regardless of what you think about their positions,\" Ackerman said. \"I think it's a good and healthy thing for our democracy that at senior decision-making levels you have individuals who served this country and whose experience is informed by that service.\"\n\nVance is likely paving the way for other post-9/11 veterans to be nominated by a major party, Ackerman added.\n\n\"On the national stage, he's the first at the top of the ticket, and I suspect he probably won't be the last,\" Ackerman said. \"I think that's a good thing for our country.\"\n\nHugh Hewitt, a conservative political commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that Trump likely viewed Vance as key to reclaiming the support from veterans that the former president lost between his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. During the 2020 presidential race, polling showed that older veterans overwhelmingly backed Trump, while younger veterans and women veterans significantly preferred President Joe Biden.\n\nThree weeks after Trump announced his VP choice during the Republican National Convention, it remained uncertain how the pick would affect polling.\n\nIn an Ipsos poll released July 30, 47% of Americans believe veterans make the best elected officials when compared to people with prior public service or those currently working in law enforcement, business, academia or news and entertainment. When it comes to confidence in elected officials, 76% believe that veterans elected to office would make good decisions.\n\nThe poll was based on a sample of 1,238 U.S. residents and conducted on behalf of With Honor Action, a veteran-led group that aims to increase the number of veterans in elected office and foster bipartisanship in Congress.\n\nWhile some veterans view Vance's nomination as a symbolic win for U.S. veterans and service members, others see his rise as a threat to democracy and foreign policy. They also frown upon his alignment with Trump after Vance initially criticized the former president.\n\nUpon Trump's election in 2016, Vance called Trump \"dangerous\" and \"unfit\" for office and said he could be \"America's Hitler.\" By 2021, Vance had reversed his opinion, citing Trump's accomplishments as president.\n\n\"While we share being Marines and from the Great State of Ohio, I'm not voting for him,\" said Plenzler, a former infantry officer and combat veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"His flip flop on the presidential candidate gives me whiplash, and I'm looking for someone with a steadier moral compass.\"\n\nMichael Smith, a former Navy officer and the executive director of Veterans for Responsible Leadership -- a Super PAC comprised of \"Never Trump\" veterans -- said that Vance's military service was honorable, but his support of Trump's antidemocratic views is not.\n\nSimilarly, Cooper, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran who commanded an EA-6B Prowler squadron, criticized Vance for not speaking out against rioters who carried out the insurrection on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nVance has said that unlike former Vice President Mike Pence, he would have used the VP's role to contest the outcome of the 2020 election, which he said was \"stolen\" from Trump.\n\n\"We would hope that those who have served in the military would represent moral courage, a willingness to stand apart from the group, at personal risk, for what is right,\" Cooper said. \"He doesn't represent what I feel deeply about.\"\n\nNaveed Shah, an Iraq War veteran and the political director of Common Defense, a progressive veterans organization, argued that people shouldn't vote for candidates merely because of their status as veterans. Like Cooper, Shah doesn't believe Vance represents the values held by some veterans of his generation.\n\nMcGrath, a veteran political candidate who lost her bid in 2020 to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., likewise said she would support a post-9/11 veteran making it onto a major-party ticket if the person stood for the values that American veterans fought for throughout history. Vance is not that person, McGrath argued.\n\n\"We have veterans who are Republicans, we have veterans who are Democrats, we have veterans who are conservative and we have veterans who are liberal. The red line is democracy itself,\" McGrath said. \"If you're somebody who perpetuates a lie, particularly continuing to say that the last election was unfair, you're basically doing the work of our adversaries. ... That's so disturbing to me.\"\n\nIn particular, McGrath and Plenzler criticized Vance's \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. He would dismantle \"a system of allies and partners\" built by the Greatest Generation and abdicate the country's responsibility to lead on the world stage, they argued.\n\nVance has accused America's NATO allies of not paying for their fair share to support Kyiv, and earlier this year, he joined 14 other Republican senators to oppose an aid package to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nVance has said his military service helped to shape his beliefs on foreign policy. When he enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, Vance believed in the mission of the Iraq War -- a belief he now describes as a mistake. Vance reflected on that time of his life in a speech on the Senate floor in April while arguing against sending aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\n\"I believed the propaganda of the George W. Bush administration that we needed to invade Iraq, that it was a war for freedom and democracy,\" Vance said. \"I served my country honorably, and I saw when I went to Iraq that I had been lied to, that the promises of the foreign policy establishment of this country were a complete joke.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who won the Democratic presidential nomination Monday, chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a longtime member of the Army National Guard, as her running mate, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday morning.\n\nIn addition to Walz, Harris' pool of potential VP picks included Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, an Afghanistan War veteran, and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a former astronaut and Navy aviator.\n\nWalz enlisted in the National Guard in 1981 at the age of 17, and he retired as a command sergeant major in 2005. He later became the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.", "source": {"uri": "militarytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

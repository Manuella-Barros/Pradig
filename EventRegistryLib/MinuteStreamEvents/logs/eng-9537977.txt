We are down, didn't want to be, but we are. So, let's fight like hell tomorrow night and leave it all out there.\"\n\nIf only the Nuggets could get a healthier version of point guard Jamal Murray, who was rusty and still bothered by his strained left calf Saturday night, going scoreless in the first half and getting targeted repeatedly after halftime by the Wolves' pick-and-rolls that produced so many good looks.\n\nMurray said everybody's fighting through ailments this time of year and he's no different, but he insisted he'll be fine for Game 2 after logging 35 minutes in Game 1.\n\nThe Wolves shot 71% in the second half and snatched a page from Denver's playbook by using an 8-0 spurt to break open the back-and-forth game in the closing minutes.\n\n\"Just watching the league the whole season, Denver is THE best team at executing down the stretch,\" Wolves guard Kyle Anderson said Sunday. \"They do such a good job. It's like uncanny at times, they're so good down the stretch. We were able to execute offensively and defensively. It was pretty impressive because you're so used to watching Denver pull out the win.\"\n\nAlso Monday night, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks renew their storied rivalry as they open their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTimberwolves lead 1-0. Game 2, 10 p.m., TNT\n\n- NEED TO KNOW: The Nuggets realize a faster start will be their best counter to the athletic and loaded Timberwolves lineup. They've trailed by big margins in the first quarter of all six of their playoff games and allowed Minnesota to get off to an 18-4 start in Game 1. No more cruising, no more pacing was the message during film review Sunday. \"We have to do a better job, and our starters in particular have to do a better job of being ready to play and setting a tone early,\" Malone said. \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\n- KEEP AN EYE ON: Edwards' supporting cast that came up so big in the second half, which was a bigger thorn in Malone's side than Edwards' 43 points. \"This may sound strange but he's going to get his,\" Malone said. \"But you look at the third quarter. Mike Conley had 11 points, did not miss a shot, Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points, did not miss a shot. Fourth quarter, Naz Reid had 14 points, went 6 for 7. Those are the guys that we have to find a way to shut down.\"\n\nINJURY WATCH: Murray's strained left calf robbed him of his usual burst to the basket and explosion off the dribble. His zero points at halftime marked his first scoreless half in 59 career playoff games.\n\nPRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets. They have to even things up before the series shifts to Minneapolis or this could indeed be an early exit for the defending champs, who would need to beat Edwards four times in five tries otherwise.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert, left, goes up to block a shot by Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, right, as Timberwolves center Naz Reid (11) looks on in the second half of Game 1 of an NBA basketball second-round playoff series Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Denver.

Minnesota's 106-99 victory gives it homecourt advantage in the Western Conference semifinals with a chance to go up 2-0 in Game 2 on Monday, May 6 (Tuesday, May 7, Manila time).\n\nThe Timberwolves have started this postseason with five straight wins - all of them convincing wins. Minnesota was the team executing down the stretch in Game 1, harassing the Nuggets into mistakes they usually inflict on opponents.\n\nBut Denver isn't panicking heading into what could be considered a must-win at home on Monday.\n\n\"Sweeping the playoffs probably wouldn't be as fun when we look back on the memories,\" Nuggets guard Reggie Jackson said.\n\nWhile the Timberwolves have coasted through the postseason, the Nuggets had to grind out wins in the first round. On Saturday, they ran into a familiar opponent, one that bothered Nikola Jokic into an 11-for-25 shooting night and held most of the Denver lineup in check.\n\nNow the onus is on the Nuggets to make the adjustments and monitor Jamal Murray's injured calf. Murray has not shot the ball well in six playoff games, but he isn't using it as an excuse.\n\n\"Everybody's got leg injuries. Everybody's playing through something at this point in the season,\" said Murray, who had 17 points in Game 1. \"My calf is no different than anybody else on the team.\"\n\nOne player who isn't struggling is Minnesota guard Anthony Edwards, who has become dominant in the postseason. He had 25 of the Timberwolves' 40 points in the first half of Game 1, finished with 43 points, and has scored 119 in the last three playoff games. He also has gained a fan: Jokic.\n\n\"To be honest, he's a special player. I have huge respect for him. he can do everything on the floor,\" Jokic said of Edwards. \"You need to give him respect, how good and how talented he is.\"\n\nWhen Denver doubled Edwards, he was able to find open teammates who knocked down shots. Naz Reid scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, including two big three-pointers.\n\n\"The whole team, we trust each other,\" Edwards said. \"It doesn't matter down the stretch who takes the shot.\"\n\nMinnesota proved fearless at the start and finish of Game 1. The Timberwolves raced out to an 18-4 lead in the first six minutes and used an 8-0 run late in the fourth quarter to pull away.\n\nThe Timberwolves respect Jokic's talent, too, and it was apparent in how much defensive attention they paid to the two-time MVP. The Timberwolves rotated big men Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Reid on Jokic and sent double teams at him when he was in the paint.\n\nJokic scored 32 points, but he had to work for them.\n\n\"Going against the best player in the world is always fun,\" Edwards said about facing Jokic. \"Going against the best team in the world is always fun.\" - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/05/anthony-edwards-may-5-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 538, "textEnd": 543}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 554, "textEnd": 559}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

So, let's fight like hell tomorrow night and leave it all out there.\"\n\nIf only the Nuggets could get a healthier version of point guard Jamal Murray, who was rusty and still bothered by his strained left calf Saturday night, going scoreless in the first half and getting targeted repeatedly after halftime by the Wolves' pick-and-rolls that produced so many good looks.\n\nMurray said everybody's fighting through ailments this time of year and he's no different, but he insisted he'll be fine for Game 2 after logging 35 minutes in Game 1.\n\nThe Wolves shot 71% in the second half and snatched a page from Denver's playbook by using an 8-0 spurt to break open the back-and-forth game in the closing minutes.\n\n\"Just watching the league the whole season, Denver is THE best team at executing down the stretch,\" Wolves guard Kyle Anderson said Sunday. \"They do such a good job. It's like uncanny at times, they're so good down the stretch. We were able to execute offensively and defensively. It was pretty impressive because you're so used to watching Denver pull out the win.\"\n\nAlso Monday night, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks renew their storied rivalry as they open their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTIMBERWOLVES AT NUGGETS\n\nTimberwolves lead 1-0. Game 2, 10 p.m., TNT\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The Nuggets realize a faster start will be their best counter to the athletic and loaded Timberwolves lineup. They've trailed by big margins in the first quarter of all six of their playoff games and allowed Minnesota to get off to an 18-4 start in Game 1. No more cruising, no more pacing was the message during film review Sunday. \"We have to do a better job, and our starters in particular have to do a better job of being ready to play and setting a tone early,\" Malone said. \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: Edwards' supporting cast that came up so big in the second half, which was a bigger thorn in Malone's side than Edwards' 43 points. \"This may sound strange but he's going to get his,\" Malone said. \"But you look at the third quarter. Mike Conley had 11 points, did not miss a shot, Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points, did not miss a shot. Fourth quarter, Naz Reid had 14 points, went 6 for 7. Those are the guys that we have to find a way to shut down.\"\n\nINJURY WATCH: Murray's strained left calf robbed him of his usual burst to the basket and explosion off the dribble. His zero points at halftime marked his first scoreless half in 59 career playoff games.\n\nPRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets. They have to even things up before the series shifts to Minneapolis or this could indeed be an early exit for the defending champs, who would need to beat Edwards four times in five tries otherwise.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arnie_stapleton@eagletribune.com", "name": "Arnie Stapleton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/58/858a98aa-e8c3-5cb7-a914-06c057ea556e/6637002778414.image.jpg?crop=1694%2C889%2C0%2C166&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Minnesota's 106-99 victory gives it homecourt advantage in the Western Conference semifinals with a chance to go up 2-0 Monday night in Game 2.\n\nThe Timberwolves have started this postseason with five straight wins -- all of them convincing wins. Minnesota was the team executing down the stretch Saturday night, harassing the Nuggets into mistakes they usually inflict on opponents.\n\nBut Denver isn't panicking heading into what could be considered a must-win at home on Monday night.\n\n\"Sweeping the playoffs probably wouldn't be as fun when we look back on the memories,\" Nuggets guard Reggie Jackson said.\n\nWhile the Timberwolves have coasted through the postseason the Nuggets had to grind out wins in the first round. On Saturday, they ran into a familiar opponent, one that bothered Nikola Jokic into an 11-for-25 shooting night and held most of the Denver lineup in check.\n\nNow the onus is on the Nuggets to make the adjustments and monitor Jamal Murray's injured calf. Murray has not shot the ball well in six playoff games, but he isn't using it as an excuse.\n\n\"Everybody's got leg injuries. Everybody's playing through something at this point in the season,\" said Murray, who had 17 points in Game 1. \"My calf is no different than anybody else on the team.\"\n\nOne player who isn't struggling is Minnesota guard Anthony Edwards, who has become dominant in the postseason. He had 25 of the Timberwolves' 40 points in the first half of Game 1, finished with 43 points, and has scored 119 in the last three playoff games. He also has gained a fan: Jokic.\n\n\"To be honest, he's a special player. I have huge respect for him. he can do everything on the floor,\" Jokic said of Edwards. \"You need to give him respect, how good and how talented he is.\"\n\nWhen Denver doubled Edwards, he was able to find open teammates who knocked down shots. Naz Reid scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, including two big 3-pointers.\n\n\"The whole team, we trust each other,\" Edwards said. \"It doesn't matter down the stretch who takes the shot.\"\n\nMinnesota proved fearless at the start and finish of Game 1. The Timberwolves raced out to an 18-4 lead in the first six minutes and used an 8-0 run late in the fourth quarter to pull away.\n\nThe Timberwolves respect Jokic's talent, too, and it was apparent in how much defensive attention they paid to the two-time MVP. The Timberwolves rotated big men Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns and Reid on Jokic and sent double teams at him when he was in the paint.\n\nJokic scored 32 points, but he had to work for them.\n\n\"Going against the best player in the world is always fun,\" Edwards said about facing Jokic. \"Going against the best team in the world is always fun.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/4bdcc360a0df929b27f7f0f2f8c8fd2e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

They will need him to start playing like it to advance past the resurgent Minnesota Timberwolves, a fellow NBA Finals-caliber opponent.\n\nAnd he knows it.\n\nOn Saturday night, after the Nuggets dropped a disappointing Game 1 at home, Jokic predictably played it cool during his postgame press conference. Even though the Nuggets got off to yet another slow start and were \"out-clutched\" by Anthony Edwards and his friends, Jokic didn't seem all that troubled. This sort of even-keeled approach has served him well in his nine-year career.\n\nBut Jokic's dry joke about Minnesota's three primary big men -- Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid -- was revealing. While undoubtedly intended as respect for his opponent, it was probably also Jokic acknowledging the tall (pun not intended) test in front of him and his team:\n\nJokic isn't lying. Denver could use another viable big man, even just some spot minutes, to throw into its rotation. Because what the Timberwolves can do to the Nuggets that most other teams can't is throw three different high-quality big men at him.\n\nGobert is a likely soon-to-be four-time Defensive Player of the Year. Towns is one of the most gifted seven-footers in basketball. Reid won this season's Sixth Man of the Year honors. Even with Gobert and Towns both fighting foul trouble on Saturday, Reid came in and scored 14 fourth-quarter points while doing an admirable job defending Jokic. Meanwhile, Jokic had his second straight game with at least seven turnovers, showing that he might be cracking at the sheer burden for Denver while Jamal Murray nurses a calf strain.\n\nShould that sort of mix continue, with Minnesota's bigs collectively trying to wear Jokic down, the Nuggets' title defense may not last much longer. If their inconsistent play doesn't tell the story here, then the fact that they now trail in a playoff series for the first time in two years should. In due time, they may well illustrate why it's so hard to repeat in the NBA.\n\nStill, there remains hope for Denver.\n\nJokic is seldom this uncharacteristically sloppy for long stretches. With his and the Nuggets' backs against the wall, they have usually responded very well during this era of Denver basketball with this core. When push comes to shove, the Nuggets are doing the shoving. It's more that they haven't had to answer this kind of adversity in a while.\n\nThe 2020 version of the Nuggets came back from consecutive 3-1 series deficits against the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Clippers. In 2021, without both an injured Murray and Michael Porter Jr., a severely undermanned Denver squad beat the Portland Trail Blazers after also losing Game 1 of the series at home. Heck, even during last year's Finals, and even though they were definitively the better team, Denver rebounded from a disappointing Game 2 defeat at home to storm back and take both matchups in Miami before eventually winning its first title in franchise history in an emphatic five games.\n\nThe Timberwolves might be different. Even beyond Minnesota's three-headed Cerberus of bigs, Edwards is a matchup problem that Denver doesn't have a definitive answer for. In all honesty, most teams might not have an answer for Minnesota's strengths, which is why it wouldn't be surprising to see it win this series.\n\nBut for now, it's just one game and one loss. It doesn't pay to ride the emotional highs and lows of what could be a long series, as some Nuggets' veterans professed on Saturday. Provided they even things up at 1-1 on Monday.\n\nFor now, Denver still has Jokic, perhaps the one player in the league who could really dig deep, go into overdrive, and turn this series into the all-out war most everyone still expects. It's hindsight in retrospect and might just be a moral victory, but the fact that the Nuggets held a four-point halftime lead and were tied with Minnesota late in the fourth quarter despite another poor Murray shooting effort should be encouraging.\n\nThe Nuggets can win this series, but Jokic and Murray have to start playing like Jokic and Murray. Jokic specifically must be the best player on either team, something that happened in each of those previous instances when opponents actually backed the Nuggets up against the wall. Murray, meanwhile, probably can't leave the top three of the overall hierarchy by the time the dust settles. We have yet to see it this postseason but to advance to their third Western Conference Finals in the last five seasons, the Nuggets' franchise players will have to bring their A+ game moving forward.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nThese Nuggets have a precedent of responding with fury when they take a gut punch.

The Nuggets losing the first game of the series was a rare sight to see but it brought out an honest and 'unfiltered' opinion from Dallas Mavericks legend, Dirk Nowitzki on Nikola Jokic and the Wolves' bigs.\n\nThe Timberwolves took Game 1, defeating the Nuggets with a 106-99 final score per NBA.com. In a stellar display, Anthony Edwards went off for a 43-point explosion, while Nikola Jokic led Denver with 32 points of his own, albeit on 2-9 shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nThe hosts of Inside The NBA went on to talk about the game and what an amazing job Minnesota did in slowing down Nikola Jokic and his impact on the game. As Kenny, Ernie, and Chuck discussed the game, Dirk Nowitzki went on to give his two cents on the Wolves, defending the Joker.\n\n\"It's almost like he was trying to do a little too much. They got three seven-footers to throw at him and he had to do a lot. He's dribbling cross-court, throwing hoop passes, it was too much. I do like Minnesota, their depth, their length, they're gonna be tough to beat in this series but I still think it's gonna be a long and fun series but Denver needs to be a little better.\"\n\nNikola Jokic may have led the Nuggets in scoring but the defenders thrown at him by the Wolves very much managed to slow him down. Looking back at the highlights of the game, there were even times when Jokic seemed gassed.\n\nAs Nowitzki said, The Joker was trying to do too much on the floor and it was evident. The Wolves had players like Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid constantly wearing down the Nuggets center.\n\nEven Kenny Smith said, \"Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid, those three guys sped The Joker up for the first time that I've ever seen in basketball.\"\n\nIf the Timberwolves continue to barrage Jokic with new and fresh defenders on the floor, one can expect someone else from the Nuggets squad to step up and take some of the offensive responsibility off him.\n\nDenver Nuggets coach Mike Malone is known for making exceptional adjustments on the floor in accordance with the defense being played by the opposing team. Apart from Jokic, the Nuggets have three more centers on their roster.\n\nWhile two of them are still rookies, it is likely the head coach will use DeAndre Jordan in some form or other to help Denver take Game 2 of this seven-game series. However, whether or not this adjustment actually helps the Denver Nuggets secure some positive momentum in this series, only time will tell.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/37a53370-untitled-design-2024-05-05t123437.942.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Also, Sling features promotional offers.\n\nPart of the reason for Minnesota's rise is because Anthony Edwards is playing like one of the best players on the planet right now.

It wasn't just the Nikola Jokic show, however. Michael Porter Jr. averaged 25 points and nine rebounds in the series and Jamal Murray hit a pair of last-second game winners to keep the Nuggets' repeat bid alive.\n\nThey'll need to figure out how to slow down the Timberwolves if they want to keep it going.\n\nHere are some more details on how to watch Game 2 for free:\n\nHere is some background from the Associated Press on Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinal\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (56-26, third in the Western Conference) vs. Denver Nuggets (57-25, second in the Western Conference)\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves visit the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference second round with a 1-0 lead in the series.

Anthony Edwards was simply unstoppable for the Timberwolves, while Nikola Jokic's life was made hard by Karl-Anthony Towns, Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid.\n\nEdwards finished the game with 43 points, seven rebounds and three assists to lead the Timberwolves to a 106-99 victory. Towns had 20 points and four rebounds, while Mike Conley put up 14 points and 10 assists. Reid added 16 points and four rebounds off the bench.\n\nMeanwhile, Jokic had 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for the defending champs. Michael Porter Jr. remained hot with 20 points and six rebounds, while Jamal Murray added 17 points and four assists. They were the only players who scored in double digits for the Nuggets.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves vs Denver Nuggets Top 10 player props for Game 2\n\n#10 - Naz Reid, Points - Over 9.5 (-112)\n\nNaz Reid is the reigning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and provided instant offense off the bench in Game 1 with 16 points. Reid also did a fantastic job making it hard for Nikola Jokic every time he came on for either Karl-Anthony Towns or Rudy Gobert.\n\n#9 - Jaden McDaniels, Points - Over 8.5 (-115)\n\nJaden McDaniels is tasked to defend the best perimeter player for the Denver Nuggets. McDaniels has done a good job in Game 1, but went scoreless in 39 minutes. He's not known for his scoring, but bettors expect him to at least be aggressive in finding his shot.\n\n#8 - Mike Conley, Pts+Ast - Under 16.5 (-125)\n\nMike Conley is coming off 14 points and 10 assists in Game 1, so there's a chance he'll drop another double-double tonight. Conley is the veteran presence the Minnesota Timberwolves needed for a deep postseason run.\n\n#7 - Aaron Gordon, Pts+Reb - Under 18.5 (-125)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets need Aaron Gordon to be effective on both sides of the ball to be successful. Gordon is tasked with defending Anthony Edwards at times, but he also needs to get it going on offense. He had nine points and three rebounds in Game 1, which is sub-par by his standards.\n\n#6 - Rudy Gobert, Rebounds - Under 12.5 (-112)\n\nRudy Gobert doesn't need to score for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Gobert's defense on Nikola Jokic is vital for the team's success, while his rebounds keep the defending champions at bay. He had 13 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in Game 1.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is knocking down 4.0 3-pointers in the first six games of the NBA playoffs. Porter went 4-for-7 in Game 1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves and finished with 20 points.\n\n#4 - Karl-Anthony Towns, Points - Under 19.5 (-115)\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns was in foul trouble in Game 1 due to defending Nikola Jokic. Towns still managed to put up 20 points and four rebounds, which is a great sign for the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n#3 - Jamal Murray, Points - Over 21.5 (-130)\n\nJamal Murray continued to struggle with his shot in Game 1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Murray went 6-for-14 from the field in the loss, but remains a threat to score the ball with ease. He's also dangerous in clutch situations, hitting two game-winners in the first round.\n\n#2 - Nikola Jokic, Pts+Reb+Ast - Under 51.5 (-115)\n\nNikola Jokic is averaging 28.8 points, 14.8 rebounds and 9.7 assists in the 2024 NBA playoffs. Jokic is capable of dropping a triple-double in every game and can do it even if he's aggressively scoring the ball or busy making plays for his team. He's really unstoppable, so the Minnesota Timberwolves are content in making things hard for him.\n\n#1 - Anthony Edwards, Points - Under 29.5 (-125)\n\nThe 2024 NBA playoffs might be a coming out party for Anthony Edwards, who is touted by many analysts as the next face of the league.

He's no stranger to the spotlight and our NBA picks expect a big game in the box score for the two-time MVP.\n\nFor the first time in nearly two full years, the pressure is squarely on the Denver Nuggets and soon-to-be three-time MVP Nikola Jokic. They have lost homecourt advantage in the Western Conference Semifinals, and the Minnesota Timberwolves could not look much better.\n\nIf the Nuggets want to avoid an 0-2 hole during their title defense, Jokic will need to do more tonight, even more than his 32-8-9 effort in the Game 1 loss.\n\nLet's look through some NBA picks and find some Nikola Jokic props before Timberwolves vs Nuggets on May 6 tips at 10:00 ET.\n\nClick on each pick to jump to the full analysis.\n\nJamal Murray is clearly not himself. The usually clutch guard shot just 6-for-14 in Game 1, including 0-for-5 in the first half. Murray scoring 17 points is concerning on its own, but his shot volume made it most obvious that his calf injury is a continuing concern.\n\nOn the way to the NBA title in 2023, Murray averaged 20.5 field-goal attempts in 20 postseason games, scoring 26.1 points per game. In this year's closer-than-it-seemed series win against the Lakers, Murray took 24 shots per game. But putting up 28 attempts in the series-clincher, including the game-winning shot with only seconds left on the clock, aggravated Murray's calf.\n\nCombine that loss of a step with the Minnesota Timberwolves' elite perimeter defenders in Jaden McDaniels, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Anthony Edwards, and Murray is going to struggle to carry his typical workload.\n\nBut in a must-win moment tonight, the Denver Nuggets still need to find offense. Nikola Jokic's game may be best enjoyed when he does a bit of everything, but his focus needs to be on scoring. If Murray is either not healthy enough to get shots up or simply cannot get loose from Minnesota's defense -- or, most likely, a bit of both -- then those four or more shots need to be taken by someone else. And no one on Denver's roster is a better scorer than Jokic, even if it is not the sole perk of his skill set.\n\nTrailing 1-0 in this series should elicit early aggression from Jokic as he shoulders the offensive burden.\n\nUnless Jokic clones himself, the Timberwolves' size will make his life difficult on the inside. Karl-Anthony Towns has proven to be a decent defender on Jokic, not stopping him because no one really can, but limiting Jokic enough. The Denver star went 4-of-12 on Saturday night when Towns defended him.\n\nThat will not change on Monday night. And then behind Towns, Minnesota can run Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid at Jokic. Even Kyle Anderson can provide spot minutes.\n\nIf Jokic tries to score all night on the inside, he will get worn out. That was already showing itself in Game 1, when he took nine 3-pointers, hitting just two of them. He should keep chucking from deep tonight, particularly with his needed offensive emphasis.\n\nThe combination of Minnesota's size and Jokic's offensive workload should drop his rebounding numbers. Unlike most teams, the Timberwolves can box him out, and spending energy to collect on the glass will only cost Jokic as he tries to replace Murray's offense. Again, both of those thoughts showed in Game 1, as Jokic finished with eight rebounds.\n\nThis same-game parlay would have cashed in Game 1, yet it is now priced at +700.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/e2d1c8f8-0825-44e8-bc34-6e60babc9537.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 775, "textEnd": 780}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

We are down, didn't want to be, but we are. So, let's fight like hell tomorrow night and leave it all out there.\"\n\nIf only the Nuggets could get a healthier version of point guard Jamal Murray, who was rusty and still bothered by his strained left calf Saturday night, going scoreless in the first half and getting targeted repeatedly after halftime by the Wolves' pick-and-rolls that produced so many good looks (they shot 71% in the second half).\n\nMurray said everybody's fighting through ailments this time of year and he's no different, but he insisted he'll be fine for Game 2 after logging 35 minutes in Game 1.\n\nAlso Monday night, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks renew their storied rivalry as they open their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTIMBERWOLVES AT NUGGETS\n\nTimberwolves lead 1-0. Game 2, 10 p.m., TNT\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The Nuggets realize a faster start will be their best counter to the athletic and loaded Timberwolves lineup. They've trailed by big margins in the first quarter of all six of their playoff games and allowed Minnesota to get off to an 18-4 start in Game 1. No more cruising, no more pacing was the message during film review Sunday. \"We have to do a better job, and our starters in particular have to do a better job of being ready to play and setting a tone early,\" Malone said. \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: Edwards' supporting cast that came up so big in the second half, which was a bigger thorn in Malone's side than Edwards' 43 points. \"This may sound strange but he's going to get his,\" Malone said. \"But you look at the third quarter. Mike Conley had 11 points, did not miss a shot, Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points, did not miss a shot. Fourth quarter, Naz Reid had 14 points, went 6 for 7. Those are the guys that we have to find a way to shut down.\"\n\nINJURY WATCH: Murray's strained left calf robbed him of his usual burst to the basket and explosion off the dribble. His zero points at halftime marked his first scoreless half in 59 career playoff games.\n\nPRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets. They have to even things up before the series shifts to Minneapolis or this could indeed be an early exit for the defending champs, who would need to beat Edwards four times in five tries otherwise.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickorlando.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "arnie_stapleton@clickorlando.com", "name": "Arnie Stapleton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/2YKTX7YOJ5H45N7X4BNHRKV5WQ.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

This information is subject to change throughout the day, however, so be sure to check the link so you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nEdwards delivers 43 points in Game 1 win\n\nAnthony Edwards delivered 43 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal, two blocks and three triples across 42 minutes in Saturday's victory over the Nuggets. Edwards capped off a tremendous first-round sweep of the Suns with 40 points in the closeout Game 4, and he kept the momentum rolling into Game 1 of the Western Conference semis. Ant-Man shot an efficient 17-of-29 from the floor and was everywhere on both sides of the ball. He came up with key play after key play, particularly in the closing minutes when Denver attempted a late comeback after falling behind by double digits. Edwards' big night on offense broke a tie with Sam Cassell for most 40-point playoff games in Timberwolves history, and the budding superstar has three such contests to his credit. He and the Wolves will look to make a statement in Game 2 on Monday night.\n\nJokic finishes Saturday's loss with 32 points\n\nNikola Jokic finished Saturday's loss to Minnesota with 32 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, three steals and two three-pointers across 41 minutes. Joker led his team in points, rebounds, assists and steals, but this game was far from blemish-free. The rest of his team combined for five turnovers, and Jokic committed seven, tied for his second-most in a playoff game. He was just 2-of-9 from beyond the arc and shot 11-of-25 from the field overall, highlighting an inefficient and turnover-riddled evening as Denver lost at home for the first time since March 29. The Nuggets have been stellar at Ball Arena, and Jokic typically doesn't make this many mistakes.

He's only improved in the playoffs. However, for the first time amid his MVP-caliber prime, Jokic didn't seem as comfortable during the Nuggets' Game Western Conference semis Game 1 against the Timberwolves.\n\nJokic put up solid numbers, which would earn praise all around for majority of his rivals, tallying 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. But he shot only 44.0%, way below his averages and took nine 3-point attempts, which is above his usual tally. Jokic seemed rushed as Minnesota had three different looks to throw at him, barely giving the two-time MVP any space to operate.\n\nJokic acknowledged the T'Wolves' efficient coverage and joked about cloning himself to deal with the issue, saying (via NBA reporter Michael Scotto):\n\n\"To have duplicate clone of myself and then I can be fresh when they sub another guy and I'm gonna be fresh.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves have the unique luxury of playing three centers who can stay on the floor, including DPOY candidate Rudy Gobert, All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns and 6th Man of the Year Naz Reid. Minnesota moved away from doubling Jokic aggressively, neutralizing his supporting cast and forcing him to play through a tough one-on-one coverage with one of the bigs waiting on the help side at all times.\n\nThat took away Nikola Jokic's scoring opportunities at the rim and the insured play of Aaron Gordon's lob on a baseline cut.\n\nNuggets need more from Nikola Jokic's supporting cast\n\nThe NBA playoffs are about realizing that every series is not meant for the best player to thrive. In the Nuggets' case against the Timberwolves, Minnesota seems to have an answer to the Nikola Jokic threat. While they may not stop him from scoring big, they can assure it's a rushed and inefficient effort that won't lead to a win.\n\nWith three bigs in the rotation and a lengthy wing defender like Jaden McDaniels, the Timberwolves boast the best coverage for Jokic. With that being the case, the Nuggets will need more out of Jamal Murray and the rest of the group. In Saturday's series opener, Murray finished with only 17 points and four assists, shooting 42.9%.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Porter Jr. had 20 points on 6 of 13 shooting. The rest of the players scored in single digits. With little to no impact from the other seven players in rotation, Jokic was forced to make plays on nearly every possession. His passing lanes were cut with single coverages, and he had to get past two big bodies to score.\n\nHe kept at it for a stretch, but that wasn't the answer to the Nuggets' woes. If the others can up their game, that can ease the pressure on Nikola Jokic significantly, allowing him to play better and stretch the Timberwolves' defense.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Computer_Aides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Computer Aides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/c483f-17148798874346-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He explained why Minnesota is designed to end the reigning champions' hopes for a repeat.\n\n\"Minnesota in 5! They got the total package. They have great coaches, they have depth, and they have three bigs that can match up against Jokic. They got a dawg, a leader of the pack in Anthony Edwards.\"\n\nHoward explained why he thinks this Wolves team is similar to the 2020 Lakers, the last team to beat a healthy Nuggets squad in the playoffs.\n\n\"That's why I was making the comparison to that (2020) Lakers team. They have an athletic team that can move and is agile with Naz Reid. They have Rudy Gobert, who's playing the best defense out of all his Defensive Player of the Year's. A LeBron-type prototype with Anthony Edwards. He's cold.\"\n\nHoward thinks the Nuggets are under pressure after losing Game 1.\n\n\"When you watch their games, they're making everyone extend their offense. They won Game 1, and now the pressure is on.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves stole home-court advantage from the Nuggets by handing them their first home loss of the Playoffs with a 106-99 win in Game 1.\n\nAnthony Edwards proved he can be the best player in the series with a 43-point outing in that win. It was an incredible showing, as the Wolves look to be the team best equipped to beat the Nuggets.\n\nThe Timberwolves Could Eliminate The Nuggets\n\nThe Wolves are built specifically to outpace a team like the Nuggets over a seven-game series. Their biggest advantage is their robust big rotation with two of Karl-Anthony Towns, Rudy Gobert, and Naz Reid on the court to deal with Nikola Jokic. Even Howard alluded to how the 2020 Lakers stopped Jokic through multiple athletic bigs like Howard and JaVale McGee in addition to the DPOY-caliber defense of Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Timberwolves have a similar recipe, with Reid and KAT as big bodies to disrupt Jokic while Gobert locks the defense together as the likely winner of the 2024 Defensive Player of the Year. Even if Jokic is unstoppable, this three-ma rotation will be the best shot any team in the NBA has at slowing him down.\n\nThe Nuggets showed plenty of vulnerabilities in the first round but managed to win the series in 5 due to their tactical and personnel advantage over the Lakers. The Wolves are a better-organized team and have the perfect personnel to beat the Nuggets.\n\nThe Wolves also have a stifling perimeter defense with Jaden McDaniels and Anthony Edwards. Edwards is the biggest differentiator of the series, as the Wolves offense has struggled all season. That hasn't been the case through the first five games of the playoffs, as Edwards is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists, single-handedly injecting offense into the team during cold spells.\n\nThe Nuggets have the championship pedigree, greater continuity, and the likely league MVP, so it won't be easy to beat them. But if there's any team that could do it, the Timberwolves are designed to do just that.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaVale_McGee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JaVale McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQwNTY2NjI1NzA3NDE5/440715128_681317887414218_887964618299286471_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The highly anticipated matchup is a rematch of last year's first-round series between the sides, one that the Nuggets won three-game-to-one.\n\nThe two sides faced off four times in the regular season, with each team claiming a victory at home and on the road. Those games don't provide a whole lot of context for what's in store over the coming week(s).\n\n\"I mean this year I think nobody was healthy, they were one time I think,\" said Jokic of the regular season series. \"It was us or them, someone was out. It's the first time we're going to have the healthy group of guys both ways. So, we will see.\"\n\nThe only time each side had their full compliment of starters was the first game of the series, back in November in a 110-89 Timberwolves win. Now, six months later, both sides look to have their full compliment of stars. Nuggets star guard Jamal Murray is listed as questionable with a left calf strain but is likely to play.\n\nOn what makes the Wolves so difficult to play, Jokic credits former Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly.\n\n\"I think they're built really well,\" said Jokic. \"I think Tim Connelly, when he made that (Gobert) trade, everybody was laughing at him... But he made a great team. I think he deserves credit for doing that.\"\n\n\"Of course the coaching staff are making things work and I think they're a really dangerous team,\" continued Jokic. \"They can have answers for everything - playing small, playing big they can do it all. They're a really dangerous team. Hopefully we can do something in the next four-plus games.\"\n\nMinnesota are coming off a four-game sweep of the Suns as they gear up for their first second-round series in 20 years. Denver knocked out the Lakers in a five game series and now look to face the team they claimed was their toughest opponent in last year's run to an NBA title.\n\n\"I think every game is different,\" said Jokic when discussing what Denver can take from their first-round series win over Los Angeles. \"Minnesota is No. 1 in defense. They are really, really, really aggressive in the defensive end. That's the No. 1 key we need to figure out. Of course, they have so many offensive threats and they're using every player in offense. So, it's going to be a challenge. Hopefully we're going to have answers for them.\"\n\nThe Nuggets will be tasked with shutting down Wolves rising star Anthony Edwards. The young guard was electric in the first-round sweep of Phoenix, averaging 31.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists while shooting 51% from the field.\n\n\"He's amazing. He's really dangerous,\" Jokic said of Edwards. \"He's a really talented player that can do everything, who has everything in his arsenal. He has the teammates to back it up. He's actually a really funny guy to be around. Hopefully we are going to have some fun too.\"\n\nIn Minnesota's opening round series they displayed their trademark defense holding the Suns to 103.3 points per game, Phoenix's 10th ranked offense averaged 116.2 points per game in the regular season. Phoenix were held below 100 points just five times this season,l and the Wolves twice held them below that mark in the first-round series.\n\n\"We cannot turn the ball over, that's the main thing,\" said Jokic when discussing the keys to overcoming the best defense in the league. \"We need to have a shot every possession.

He's Smarter Than Your Head Coach.\"", "body": "In anticipation of Game 2, Nuggets beat reporter Harrison Wind offered insights into what to expect from Nikola Jokic, likening the All-Star center to artificial intelligence:\n\n\"I expect to see Nikola Jokic have a statement-like game. Nikola Jokic, he's like artificial intelligence. He gets better as every series goes on. The more he learns about you, the more he plays against you, the more reps he gets against your defense, the better he plays.\"\n\n\"Like, he's smarter than your head coach, he's smarter than everybody on your team. So, as every playoff series goes on, he gets better and I expect him to gradually start to figure out this Timberwolves defense more and more and that starts for me tomorrow on game two.\"\n\nWind's analogy underscores Jokic's cerebral approach to the game, suggesting that his ability to adapt and evolve over the course of a playoff series sets him apart. Drawing parallels to artificial intelligence, Wind highlights Jokic's capacity to analyze and exploit opposing defenses, making him a formidable opponent on the court.\n\nAs the series progresses, Wind predicts that Jokic will continue to dissect the Timberwolves' defensive schemes, leveraging his basketball IQ to gain a competitive edge. His assessment reflects the widespread recognition of Jokic's basketball acumen and strategic prowess, positioning him as a key factor in the Nuggets' playoff campaign.\n\nIn the previous game, Jokic demonstrated his impact with an impressive stat line of 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists. Despite his stellar performance, the Nuggets fell short against the Timberwolves, losing 106-99 in Game 1 of the second-round series. While Jokic's individual contributions were noteworthy, they were not enough to secure a victory for Denver.\n\nWith Game 2 on the horizon, all eyes will be on Jokic as he looks to lead the Nuggets to victory and level the series against the Timberwolves. As Wind suggests, Jokic's ability to adapt and elevate his performance could prove pivotal in shaping the outcome of the game and the series as a whole.\n\nThe Wolves Are The Toughest Opponents The Denver Nuggets Has Faced In The Last 2 Years\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have encountered formidable opponents in recent years, including the Lakers and the Suns, but the Minnesota Timberwolves present a unique challenge, making them the toughest matchup the Nuggets have faced in the last two years.\n\nWhile the Nuggets have historically dominated the Lakers and breezed past the Wolves in previous encounters, this season tells a different story. The Wolves, led by Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Rudy Gobert, along with the emergence of Naz Reid as the Sixth Man of the Year, pose a significant threat.\n\nThe Timberwolves' defensive prowess, ranking as the top unit in the league this season, presents a formidable challenge for the Nuggets. Their length, ball pressure, depth, variability, and reactivity make them a formidable opponent on both ends of the court.\n\nThe Nuggets' road to contention has been marked by their offensive flexibility, orchestrated by Nikola Jokic, and complemented by the acquisition of Aaron Gordon. However, facing a defense like the Wolves presents a unique challenge that the Nuggets have not encountered before.\n\nMinnesota's defensive strategy, anchored by Gobert's rim protection and supported by the length and athleticism of players like Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, poses a significant obstacle for Denver's offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Wolves' offensive improvement, buoyed by the growth of Edwards and the defensive presence of players like McDaniels, adds another layer to their challenge. With the Wolves' length and defensive acumen, the Nuggets will need to rely on Jokic's playmaking abilities to navigate their way through the defense and create scoring opportunities.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves present the toughest matchup the Denver Nuggets have faced in the last two years.

One of the games on tap from today's slate features the Denver Nuggets hosting the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 1 of the conference semifinals.\n\nHere is a look at which squad has the edge heading into this matchup and why.\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves Game 2 Info\n\nWhen\n\nMon. May 6\n\nWhere\n\nBall Arena\n\nTime\n\n10:00 PM EST\n\nLocation\n\nDenver, CO\n\nTV\n\nTNT\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves - How We Got Here & Betting Trends Denver is the favorite heading into Game 2\n\nThe Denver Nuggets stormed through the playoffs, dropping only four contests en route to winning it all last season. This included a 4-1 series win over the Timberwolves in the opening round. However, Minnesota emerged victorious in the series opener 106-99. Nikola Joki\u0107 led the way with 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. added 20 points and six rebounds while shooting 4-for-7 from 3-point range. Jamal Murray -- who is playing through a calf injury -- contributed 17 points and four assists. The Timberwolves proved to be a tough out when these teams clashed in last year's playoffs.\n\nUsually, it is the opponent that has to adjust to the defending champions. However, following a Game 1 loss, Denver is the team that needs to adjust to avoid a deficit of 0-2 heading back to the Twin Cities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Timberwolves have played exceptionally well in these playoffs. After sweeping the Phoenix Suns in the opening round, Minnesota's solid play continued in the series opener against the Nuggets. Anthony Edwards paced the team's offense with 43 points (including 25 in the first half) on 17-for-29 shooting from the field. He also tallied seven rebounds and three assists.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns added 20 points, four rebounds, and three assists. Naz Reid scored 16 points off the bench, while Mike Conley finished with a double-double that included 14 points (on 5-for-8 shooting) and 10 assists for a Minnesota team that shot 52.4 percent from the field and 40.7 percent from beyond the arc. Denver's head coach offered this assessment of the Timberwolves' performance.\n\n\"Naz Reid got going. Karl-Anthony Towns got going. Mike Conley got going -- where Anthony Edwards carried the day in that first half. But the second half I just felt not nearly enough discipline and physicality, and they were able to get whatever they wanted.\" - Mike Malone\n\nThe Timberwolves lead the playoff field in scoring, averaging 115.8 points per contest. Unless the Nuggets can slow down this offense, they could be facing an uphill battle the rest of the way.\n\nNow that we have set the stage for this Game 2 showdown, let's examine the betting trends for both sides.\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis The Spread\n\nDespite losing the series opener, the Nuggets are a 5.5-point favorite coming into this matchup (per BleacherNation.com).

However, facing a trio of imposing big men Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid presented a unique challenge for the Denver Nuggets' star center.\n\n\"To have duplicate clone of myself and then I can be fresh when they sub another guy and I'm gonna be fresh.\"\n\nAfter a tough loss in Game 1 of the series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jokic humorously expressed his frustration, suggesting that he would need a duplicate clone of himself to counter their defensive prowess effectively.\n\nStanding at 6 feet 11 inches and weighing nearly 285 pounds, Jokic possesses a rare combination of size and skill. Yet, the Timberwolves' formidable frontcourt trio posed significant obstacles for him, limiting his effectiveness on the court. Despite recording an impressive stat line of 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists, Jokic struggled against the suffocating defense employed by Minnesota.\n\nThe Timberwolves' defensive strategy disrupted Jokic's rhythm, forcing him into turnovers and reducing his shooting efficiency. With their ability to rotate multiple big men who excel defensively, Minnesota effectively neutralized Jokic's impact in the paint, making it difficult for him to find scoring opportunities.\n\nJokic's lighthearted comment about needing a duplicate clone of himself underscores the frustration he experienced while facing the Timberwolves' imposing frontcourt. The trio's ability to provide constant defensive pressure forced Jokic to work harder for his points and limited his ability to dominate the game as he typically does.\n\nDespite the setback in Game 1, Jokic remains a formidable presence on the court, capable of adjusting his game to counter opposing defenses. As the series progresses, the Nuggets will need Jokic to find ways to navigate the challenges posed by Minnesota's big men and lead his team to victory. However, with the Timberwolves' defensive prowess on full display, overcoming their formidable frontcourt will require a collective effort from the entire Nuggets squad.\n\nThe Nuggets Could Have A Problem\n\nThe Denver Nuggets find themselves in unfamiliar territory after a 106-99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals. This marks the first time Denver has trailed in a postseason series since the 2022 playoffs, where they fell to the higher-seeded Warriors in the first round. Notably, the Nuggets remained unscathed by series deficits during their championship run in 2023.\n\nOne glaring issue for the Nuggets in Game 1 was their inability to contain Anthony Edwards. The rising star guard poured in 43 points on 17-of-29 shooting, reminiscent of a young Michael Jordan. Edwards' scoring outburst included 25 first-half points, leaving the Nuggets' defense perplexed by his versatile offensive arsenal.\n\nMoreover, Denver struggled on the offensive glass against Minnesota's formidable frontcourt. The Timberwolves, led by Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid, limited Denver to just three offensive rebounds in Game 1. This stark contrast to their dominance on the boards in the previous series against the Lakers underscores the challenge posed by Minnesota's size and athleticism.\n\nJamal Murray's inconsistency further compounded Denver's woes. The Nuggets' guard failed to score in the first half of Game 1, marking the first scoreless playoff half of his career. While Murray managed to tally 17 points in the second half, his slow start hindered Denver's offensive rhythm against Minnesota's stout defense.\n\nLooking at the broader defensive picture, the Timberwolves boasted the league's best defensive rating during the regular season, holding opponents to just 108.4 points per 100 possessions. This defensive prowess was evident in their ability to stymie Denver's offense, particularly Jamal Murray, whose postseason scoring efficiency has dipped compared to previous years.\n\nAs the series progresses, the Nuggets must address these shortcomings to avoid falling further behind. Finding defensive solutions to contain Anthony Edwards and neutralize Minnesota's frontcourt dominance will be paramount. Additionally, revitalizing Jamal Murray's offensive impact could provide the spark needed to shift momentum in Denver's favor.\n\nDespite the challenges highlighted in Game 1, the Nuggets remain a resilient and talented team capable of mounting a comeback. However, they must adapt quickly and execute their adjustments effectively to overcome the formidable obstacles posed by the Timberwolves.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishwesha_kumar@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Vishwesha Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjIyMTA4NDY2ODgxOTQ3/438112385_951213823323333_6379192931777218034_n.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

In a dominant performance, he led the Timberwolves with 43 points, shooting 17-for-29 and playing remarkable defense.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns contributed 20 points on 8-for-13 shooting, while Naz Reid added 16 points from the bench in 23 minutes.

However, Nikola Jokic and Michael Porter Jr., standout performers in their previous series against the Lakers, will need more support.\n\nJamal Murray, who had consistently taken at least 20 shots per game against the Lakers, managed only 17 in 14 attempts.

Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBeing one of the biggest teams in the NBA, size-wise has arguably been the biggest reason behind the Denver Nuggets' success. However, they now face a team with much more length who are known for their suffocating defense. After their loss in Game 1 of this series, Nikola Jokic was asked to comment on the Minnesota Timberwolves frontcourt big three (Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Naz Reid), and what he could do to be more impactful against them. The Joker's response has left social media in an absolute frenzy.\n\nNikola Jokic stands at 6ft 11\" and weighs almost 285 lbs, per NBA.com. There is rarely any player in the NBA that can match his size and skill. However, the Wolves having three players of a similar stature gives them a huge advantage on the defensive end.\n\nIn fact, after Jokic failed to lead the Nuggets to a win at the Ball Arena, he hilariously even revealed that he would need to clone himself to help have a positive impact on the subsequent games.\n\n\"To have a duplicate clone of myself,\" Jokic said, per Dave McMenamin.\n\nThe two-time MVP's stat line was pretty visually appealing - 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists. However, one needs to dive deep into the advanced stats to see just how good of a job the Minnesota Timberwolves were doing of defending against him.\n\nAfter recording 16.2 rebounds in the opening-round series against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Serb was restricted to merely 8 rebounds tonight. Apart from committing a season-high 7 turnovers (per ESPN), the reigning Finals MVP also had a slightly subpar shooting display, efficiency-wise, as per his standards. The 44% shooting from the field that he recorded has been the lowest since the 17 March clash against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe stat sheet may not completely show it, but the trio of Gobert, Towns, and Reid had Jokic visibly exhausted. With the three playing excellently on the defensive end of the floor, Anthony Edwards was able to carry a much higher offensive load, resulting in quite the performance.\n\nAs expected, Game 1 of the Wolves-Nuggets series was an action-packed thriller that witnessed 6 lead changes and 10 ties before Chris Finch's boys were able to pull away with a six-point win. And individually as well, the Anthony Edwards-Nikola Jokic duel lived up to its hype.\n\nWhile Jokic began the series by recording a near 32-point triple-double, Ant-Man lodged one of his most efficient performances yet. Shooting the ball at a 58.5% FG, 42.9% 3FG, and 100% FT splits, the 6ft 4\" combo guard finished the night with 43 points, per NBA.com. The 22-year-old was also able to record a box plus-minus of +10 due to the 7 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 'stocks' (steals + rebounds) that he was able to put up.\n\nAfter seeing him trash-talk all throughout the first-round series against Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns, it was also great to see him lauding his opponent for a change. During the postgame conference, the two-time All-Star disclosed enjoying the battle against the best player and team.\n\n\"Going against the best player in the world is always fun... going against the best team in the world is always fun,\" Ant said.\n\nJokic seemed to share his opponent's sentiments after witnessing Edwards put up an impressive display.\n\n\"I have a huge respect for Anthony Edwards. You have to enjoy and respect somebody like that,\" the Nuggets leader said.\n\nFans are in for one entertaining series if Game 1 is any indication. With the Wolves now up 1-0 in the series, the ball now seems to be in the reigning champions' park. Can they come out with the right countermeasure for this blistering, young side?", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combo_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combo guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/1b71e6c8-untitled-design-2024-05-05t113939.819.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-17", "textStart": 1952, "textEnd": 1960}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Timberwolves have them in unfamiliar territory: \"We know it's gonna be a long series\"", "body": "The basketball robot programmed to troubleshoot and negate any problem with relative ease encountered a worthy brain-teaser Saturday night.\n\nHow does one center adjust to a team that's able to throw three capable and well-rested bigs at him throughout the course of a game?\n\nNikola Jokic was actually stumped.\n\n\"Have a duplicate clone of myself,\" he said finally. \"And then I can be fresh when they sub another guy.\"\n\nAfter the Nuggets' 106-99 Game 1 loss at Ball Arena, no other comment more fittingly epitomized the daunting uphill battle they face in the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n\"They already were a good team last year, so we know this team is very good,\" Michael Porter Jr. said. \"We know it's gonna be a long series. And it's gonna be a good series. We've just gotta get the next one.\"\n\nIf they don't get the next one Monday, they'll be presented with an adversity the likes of which they haven't had to deal with in multiple years. Going to Minnesota down 2-0 is not an option if Denver wants to repeat as the NBA champion.\n\n\"We're the defending champs. We've gotta act like it,\" Christian Braun said. \"I think everybody's confident. Everybody knows we've got the ability to come back from this. It's one game. First to four. You can't get too high or too low.\"\n\nTim Connelly built the Nuggets, so it's only logical that he's the best-equipped executive in the NBA to craft a team that's designed to beat the Nuggets. Jokic is in for a true grind.\n\nThe Timberwolves are clearly comfortable with their primary coverage, in which Karl-Anthony Towns matches up on Jokic while likely Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert lurks from the perimeter to the paint, doubling as a dam denying Aaron Gordon on lobs, and as a last line of rim defense if Jokic attacks. (He can be both simultaneously because he's so good.)\n\nBut they're also comfortable with Gobert guarding Jokic straight-up whenever Towns is taking a breather. Or with Naz Reid daring the officials with additional interior physicality off the bench.\n\nJokic turned it over seven times in the series-opening loss. And now Denver is in uncharted territory -- trailing a series for the first time in the last two postseasons.\n\n\"It is a foreign feeling,\" Peyton Watson said. \"... For us, it's just a learning experience, and we're gonna be better. What championship team hasn't faced adversity?\"\n\nDefensively, the Timberwolves just keep coming. Their bench's net rating of 3.1 was the best in the Western Conference this season. They're versatile enough in their starting lineup to cross-match without it reeking of desperation. Jaden McDaniels' wingspan is always an irritant for Jamal Murray, but Anthony Edwards also happens to be talented and competitive enough to pick up the opponent's best guard at half-court with suffocating point-of-attack defense -- all while scoring a game-high 43 points.\n\n\"They're long. They're physical. They're making you make or take tough shots,\" Jokic said. \"And it's not just that. They know what they're doing on pick-and-rolls. They put a lot of good defenders on Jamal and Reggie (Jackson) in the pick-and-roll.\"\n\nScoring droughts are supposed to be the counterbalance, the reason Minnesota is an underdog despite its top-ranked defense. It's supposed to be an Ant-dependent offense to a fault, lacking the late game identity that Denver possesses.\n\nBut the Nuggets allowed the Timberwolves to shoot an alarming 71% from the floor in the second half. Edwards was Minnesota's only player who missed multiple field goals after halftime, and that was only because he attempted 12 (and still made seven, overcoming an increase in double-teams).\n\nTowns found a rhythm after the break. More detrimentally, role players Mike Conley and Naz Reid combined for 30 second-half points by making 12 of 13 shots. They had each been scoreless at halftime.\n\n\"It'll be a quick exit if we allow four guys to get off like that,\" coach Michael Malone said.\n\nMinnesota's clutch time offensive rating in Game 1 resembled Denver's dominance over the Lakers: 200 sharp, or an automatic two points per possession.\n\n\"We can live, of course, with a bank shot for Naz or for Rudy,\" Jokic said, referring to a pair of baskets in the fourth quarter. \"But there were some easy, easy (baskets), basically layups. Some of them were matchups, probably. Some of them were concepts. And some of them were just guarding. ... It's a little bit of everything. It's not just one thing. But yes, maybe if we have a mismatch we need to help a little bit more. Just to try to be physical. Try to be really aggressive.\"\n\nMalone made a straight line from the court to the podium for his postgame news conference, fed up with the lapses his team was prone to but never quite burned by during the first round. \"Forty-eight minutes,\" he said. \"You can't play a half of basketball in the Western Conference semifinals.\"\n\nMeeting that challenge has become a matter of mental strain for the Nuggets recently. Against the towering, terrifying Minnesota Timberwolves, it's going to be a physical burden as well.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors":

On Monday, the Nuggets (61-26, 36-8 home, 39-47-1 ATS) will try to even the best-of-seven series at one game apiece when they host the T-Wolves at Ball Arena in Game 2 at 8:10 pm MT/10:10 pm ET.\n\nDenver was listed as a 4.5-point home favorite ahead of Game 1 and, despite falling 106-99, has been established as 5.5-point chalk in the T-Wolves vs Nuggets Game 2 odds.\n\nOn the moneyline, the Nuggets are -223 favorites with Minnesota coming back as +180 underdogs to take a 2-0 series lead. The game total sees quite a range across sportsbooks, listed as low as 206.5 at BetMGM and as high as 207.5 at FanDuel, both down from 208.5 on Saturday.\n\nOdds as of May 6 at BetMGM. Use these BetMGM promos to wager on the 2024 NBA playoffs.\n\nThe winner of the T-Wolves/Nuggets series will face the winner of the Dallas Mavericks vs OKC Thunder in the Western Conference finals in the NBA playoff bracket.\n\nTimberwolves leading scorer Anthony Edwards (25.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG. 5.1 APG) was nothing short of sensational on Saturday, scoring a game-high 43 points on 58.6% shooting from the field (42.9% from three) with seven rebounds, three assists, two blocks, and a steal in 42 minutes. Rudy Gobert grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds, helping Minnesota finish +6 on the glass (42-36).\n\nMinnesota's defense continued to play outstanding, limiting the Nuggets to 46.7% from the field and surrendering just three offensive rebounds the entire game. Nikola Jokic scored 32 points for Denver but was just 11-of-25 from the floor (44%). All five of Denver's starters were -9 or worse while on the court.\n\nMinnesota is now a perfect 5-0 in the postseason, while the Nuggets are 4-2 after beating the Lakers in five in the first round.\n\nDenver went a perfect 8-0 at home last season while winning the Western Conference (and, eventually, the NBA title). But they are now just 1-2 at home against Minnesota this season, and 2-3 overall against the Timberwolves.\n\nThe Nuggets' injury report for Game 2 once again lists Jamal Murray 21.2 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 6.5 APG) as questionable with a calf injury. Murray scored 17 points on 6-of-14 shooting in 34 minutes in Game 1. He played at least 39 minutes in all five games against the Lakers.\n\nRookie Jaylen Clark, who's never played a minute in the NBA, continues to be the only name on the T-Wolves' injury report. In other words, Minnesota enters Game 2 fully healthy.\n\nNBA player props as of May 6 at DraftKings.\n\nThe player props for Game 2 show some notable shifts from Game 1. Jokic's point total has been upped from 27.5 to 29.5. Edwards' point total has also been increased from 27.5 to 28.5. Murray has gone down a point from 23.5 to 22.5. After grabbing 13 rebounds in Game 1 - one shy of his total of 13.5 - Gobert's rebound total has come down to 12.5 for Game 2.\n\nI understand the concept of a bounce-back game, and the Nuggets have a phenomenal track record on their home court over the last two-plus years, but my eyes tell me Minnesota is the better team right now. They have the personnel to contain Jokic and Murray is clearly not 100%. It wasn't a fluke that they held Denver under 100 points in Game 1. The Timberwolves' defense has been the best in the league all season, and they are fully healthy heading into Game 2.\n\nI wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Minnesota leaves Denver with a 2-0 series lead, signalling a changing of the guard in the West.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha Paruk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23191765.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 101, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The Timberwolves may have to fight for victory without their starting center.\n\nRudy Gobert's availability suddenly came into question just over eight hours before the 10 p.m. ET Game 2 tip-off. He isn't nursing an injury, but he still may not be on the floor for the Timberwolves in Denver.\n\nHere's what to know about Gobert's status and whether he is playing as Minnesota looks to take another 2-0 series lead.\n\nThe Timberwolves haven't officially announced what might prevent Gobert from playing. The 31-year-old Frenchman's partner announced in February that the couple are expecting a child together, per ESPN's Dave McMenamin, so Gobert's potential absence may be related to that.\n\nGobert recorded 6 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 blocks in Game 1 while providing the Nuggets with a steady, defensive anchor. He helped to keep Nuggets star Nikola Jokic in check -- something that Jokic admitted after the game -- his presence looms large for this series.\n\nIf Gobert isn't available, Naz Reid would likely step into a starting role if the Timberwolves stick with the two-big lineup that troubled the Nuggets throughout Game 1. Reid had 16 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists off the bench in Game 1.\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves will air on TNT in the United States.

It is the first time since 2022 that they are trailing in a series, but the Nuggets are more than capable of bouncing back in Game 2. Anthony Edwards was phenomenal as he tallied 43 points on 17/29 shooting from the field, while Karl Anthony-Towns and Naz Reid played at a sensational level as well.\n\nIt has been a long time since Nikola Jokic did not look comfortable in the postseason as he committed seven turnovers and shot a measly 44% from the field. Jamal Murray was surrounded by lengthy and versatile wings throughout the night, and the role players were a no-show for the Nuggets. Head coach Michael Malone will implement critical adjustments for Monday night, and Denver must win before the series heads to Minnesota.\n\nWith the championship pedigree of the organization, these are the three most important adjustments for the Nuggets in Game 2.\n\nHave a more well-rounded shot distribution\n\nIn Game 1, the Timberwolves had the prime focus on limiting everyone else and making Jokic commit a ton of shots for the whole contest. Jokic attempted 25 shots, Murray recorded 14 attempts, and Michael Porter Jr. tallied 13 shots. For the rest of the roster, there were no legitimate threats for Denver. Thus, it was easier for Minnesota to execute its defensive schemes due to the lack of offensive aggression on Denver's side.\n\nAaron Gordon and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope cannot attempt just a total of ten shots in almost a combined 70 minutes of play. During last year's championship run, there were vital instances wherein the ancillary pieces had a couple of fantastic games that catapulted them to the mountaintop. In Game 1, that was far from the case, so Malone must make a few tweaks in his rotation to maximize the talent of his guys.\n\nIncrease the difficulty of Edwards' shots\n\nMonitoring the degree of difficulty of Edwards' attempts in Game 1 was a tough sight to see for the Nuggets fanbase. His repertoire has been amazing this year, but Denver must make it a point to make it harder for him to manufacture looks at the rim. Caldwell-Pope was the primary defender on Edwards, but Edwards cooked him by shooting 8/11 from the field when Caldwell-Pope was on him.\n\nThere were numerous instances throughout the night wherein Edwards was hunting for Murray or Jokic to switch onto him, and he continued his remarkable outing. Caldwell-Pope was successful in containing his scoring surge in the regular season, but the power and strength of Edwards has been spectacular in the postseason. Gordon can be an option to guard Edwards, but Malone will need to put a smaller man on Towns, so the adjustments will be a continuous process for both teams.\n\nThe bench must elevate their play\n\nThe Timberwolves have the Sixth Man of the Year in their roster, and they have a couple of more assets that are reliable when the starters are taking the breather. For Denver, losing Bruce Brown and Jeff Green will be felt the most in this series because of the deep unit of Minnesota.\n\nReggie Jackson and Christian Braun are capable of matching the production of the opponent's bench, so they will need to be maximized in Game 2. Jokic and Murray had a plethora of the ball-handling duties, and it likely took a toll on them in the second half. Jackson and Braun are two men who can bring down the ball for several possessions and contribute to various facets of the game as well.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Braun_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Braun (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Brown_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Brown (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Biggest-adjustments-Nuggets-must-make-after-surprise-Game-1-loss-to-Timberwolves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

No one better than Nikola\n\nNikola Jokic, soon to be a three-time Most Valuable Player, wasn't the most valuable player on the court Saturday night. Anthony Edwards earned that honor with a 43-point performance. That can't be the case again in Game 2. Minnesota mostly guarded Jokic straight up with Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid after the Lakers opted to double team him for most of the first round. Jokic still managed 32 points, but nine of his 25 shots attempts came from 3-point range, and he committed seven turnovers. He can make his life easier with an aggressive approach inside early in Game 2. Denver's best player has demonstrated an ability to get Minnesota's bigs in foul trouble. If he can do that Monday, it will make it easier for him to be the best player on the court.\n\n2. What can Braun do for you\n\nAs the 43 points suggests, Denver's defense didn't do close to enough to disrupt Edwards in Game 1. Minnesota's star bumped smaller defenders off their spot to create open midrange shots, and he drove by bigger defenders when the opportunity presented itself. Christian Braun looked like the only player on the Nuggets' roster who was up to the task of matching the rare blend of strength and explosiveness, though it came in a smaller sample size. If Edwards starts strong, Denver should lean on its second-year wing to make things more challenging for Edwards in Game 2.\n\n3. Start strong\n\nHeard this one before? Sure, the Nuggets overcame the early 18-4 deficit and led by two at the end of the first quarter, but Denver continues to make life harder on itself by falling behind by double digits early in games. Minnesota's start in Game 1 provided Anthony Edwards plenty of momentum, as he scored 16 of his points in the first 12 minutes, while Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic combined to make just two of their 10 shots in the first quarter. If Denver gets off to another slow start Monday, the anxiety inside Ball Arena will be palpable, and it could result in Denver going to Minneapolis without a win.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vinny_benedetto@gazette.com", "name": "Vinny Benedetto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/a0/fa0155cd-8587-51a3-be61-c1ef69a6fbb1/6637f35877a94.image.jpg?crop=1773%2C931%2C0%2C118&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The home-court fans were taken aback by Anthony Edwards' attacks and the Wolves defense that succeeded in holding the Nuggets back. Following a 99-106 defeat in the first game of the Western Conference semi-finals, Denver's Nikola Jokic figured out the key to succeeding against the Wolves in the series.\n\nWhen Jokic was asked in the post-game press conference, \"What's the adjustment that you can make to them rotating Rudy Gobert, [Karl-Anthony Towns], and [Naz Reid] on you?\" he amusingly answered with a smile, \"To have a duplicate clone of myself, and then I can be fresh. When they sub another guy, I'm gonna be fresh.\" The Serbian center further appreciated Minnesota's defense and put his focus on the next game.\n\nThe strategy that the Wolves applied was to rotate the players throughout the game, which the Nuggets took time to adjust to. Standing tall in the center were Gobert, Towns, and Reid, who grabbed 21 rebounds, blocked three of the Nuggets' shots, and chipped in 36 points together.\n\nTo break the defense line, a clone is exactly what the 2-time MVP might need in the upcoming games. Despite failing to snatch a win in the first encounter, there was a silver lining to Nikola Jokic's night.\n\nNikola Jokic has etched his name several times on the NBA's historic feats this season with his remarkable performance. Even in the playoffs, he continued to show off his exceptional abilities and bagged another achievement.\n\nAfter adding a team-high 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists to his name, the reigning NBA champion surpassed the names of Bob Cousy, Jaylen Brown, and Kevin Johnson, who had 2,018, 2,025, and 2,026 total playoff points, respectively, to become the 64th player in the list with a total of 2042 points in the playoff series till now.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd is a point ahead of Jokic on the list, whom he will easily exceed in the next game against the Timberwolves on Monday, where the latter will have the upper hand.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Johnson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Johnson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Cousy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Cousy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1498044024-scaled-e1714901930579.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

So, let's fight like hell tomorrow night and leave it all out there.\"\n\nIf only the Nuggets could get a healthier version of point guard Jamal Murray, who was rusty and still bothered by his strained left calf Saturday night, going scoreless in the first half and getting targeted repeatedly after halftime by the Wolves' pick-and-rolls that produced so many good looks.\n\nMurray said everybody's fighting through ailments this time of year and he's no different, but he insisted he'll be fine for Game 2 after logging 35 minutes in Game 1.\n\nThe Wolves shot 71% in the second half and snatched a page from Denver's playbook by using an 8-0 spurt to break open the back-and-forth game in the closing minutes.\n\n\"Just watching the league the whole season, Denver is THE best team at executing down the stretch,\" Wolves guard Kyle Anderson said Sunday. \"They do such a good job. It's like uncanny at times, they're so good down the stretch. We were able to execute offensively and defensively. It was pretty impressive because you're so used to watching Denver pull out the win.\"\n\nAlso Monday night, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks renew their storied rivalry as they open their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series at Madison Square Garden.\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The Nuggets realize a faster start will be their best counter to the athletic and loaded Timberwolves lineup. They've trailed by big margins in the first quarter of all six of their playoff games and allowed Minnesota to get off to an 18-4 start in Game 1. No more cruising, no more pacing was the message during film review Sunday. \"We have to do a better job, and our starters in particular have to do a better job of being ready to play and setting a tone early,\" Malone said. \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: Edwards' supporting cast that came up so big in the second half, which was a bigger thorn in Malone's side than Edwards' 43 points. \"This may sound strange but he's going to get his,\" Malone said. \"But you look at the third quarter. Mike Conley had 11 points, did not miss a shot, Karl-Anthony Towns had 11 points, did not miss a shot. Fourth quarter, Naz Reid had 14 points, went 6 for 7. Those are the guys that we have to find a way to shut down.\"\n\nINJURY WATCH: Murray's strained left calf robbed him of his usual burst to the basket and explosion off the dribble. His zero points at halftime marked his first scoreless half in 59 career playoff games.\n\nPRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets.

In his past three road playoff games, Edwards has averaged 39.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists on a 56/44/89 shooting split.\n\nStill, I expect a negative regression in the Timberwolves' shooting percentages as a team in Game 2 after converting 71% of their second-half shots on Saturday..\n\nWhat will happen when Denver coach Mike Malone forces the ball out of Edwards' hands on the offensive end of the floor?\n\n\" READ MORE: Back the Pacers covering as underdogs vs Knicks in Game 1 of ECSF\n\nMinnesota does not have the offensive firepower outside of Edwards to keep up with Denver, a team that still had an impressive team shooting split of 47/42/80 in Game 1 despite the Wolves' best defensive effort and Murray's slow start.\n\nCan we expect Edwards, Karl Anthony-Towns, Mike Conley and Naz Reid to combine for nearly 61% field-goal shooting against the defending champions on the road again, especially considering that many of those looks were in the mid-range and not open 3s or layups? Unlikely.\n\nWhile Murray could continue to struggle with McDaniels or Alexander-Walker glued to him all game (and with the calf injury that has been bugging him), I expect the Nuggets to have a more concerted defensive effort on forcing the ball out of Edwards' hands.\n\nMurray will be hard to hide defensively, but the Nuggets are familiar with this challenge. They have had to get creative with their defensive schemes before.\n\nDenver should pull away in the second half and cover for us.

They went on a run in the last couple of minutes and that's how they won the game. What we were missing, I don't know. It seems like they made a lot of shots, especially in the second half. Some of them were open, some of them were not open. It's a part of basketball. We need to do a better job with that. Just make them make tough shots or make an extra pass. Just make them work more for the basket.\"\n\nDenver will look to bounce back in Game 2.\n\nNikola Jokic Could Pass LeBron James on Historic List Next Season\n\nFormer Nuggets Player Unleashes Controversial LeBron James Take", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_linn@si.com", "name": "Joey Linn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5867,h_3300,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx56grfa1rav6pfm3m", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

While Anthony Edwards ran riot in the first half, Karl-Anthony Towns, Naz Reid and Mike Conley clinched the win in the second half. After a complete team game by the Minnesota side, former player turned analyst Kenny Smith marveled over the performance.\n\nWhile discussing the game on the set of NBA On TNT, Kenny pointed out the defensive play by Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid. Praising their continuous pressure on Nikola Jokic, Smith said, \"Great defensive effort by Rudy Gobert and Karl Anthony-Towns, even if at the end, even though he was in foul trouble, and Naz Reid. Those three guys sped The Joker up for the first time that I've ever seen, ever in basketball.\"\n\nNikola Jokic again put up the numbers with his 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists, but his FG came down to 44% from 59.1% in the Lakers series. The credit indeed goes to the three big men of the Timberwolves, and renowned big man Dirk Nowitzki also had the same take as Kenny Smith.\n\nShaquille O'Neal is the usual face sitting in the NBA on TNT's analyst panel, but on Saturday, he was replaced by Dirk Nowitzki. The legendary German followed the opening game of the Timberwolves vs. Nuggets series and pointed out how the visitors choked Nikola Jokic.\n\nAfter hearing Kenny Smith's assessment, Dirk Nowitzki said, \"It's almost like he[Jokic] was trying to do a little too much. They got three seven-footers to throw at him and he had to do a lot.\" Liking the depth of the Timberwolves, the NBA Hall of Famer added that he believes Minnesota will be a hard side to beat, and the series will be a fun and long one.\n\nNikola Jokic had 7 turnovers in the game, and it is a testament to the Wolves defensive shape that suffocated the Serbian. After the game, Jokic jokingly said that he would be needing a clone to find a way through the close attentions of the likes of Gobert, KAT and Reid.\n\nClone or not, Jokic and Co. will need to turn the corners in the next game on Monday or the Nuggets just might be on the receiving end of the same punishment the Timberwolves dished out to the Suns.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FotoJet-16-e1714915915151-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

They find themselves trailing in a playoff series. After a back-and-forth first half, the Minnesota Timberwolves behind the play of Anthony Edwards seized control of game one and won out right down the stretch. Now the Nuggets will look to even the series before they head to Minnesota for game three in what has become a crucial victory for them. Denver will need to get big contributions from Nikola Joki\u0107, Michael Porter Jr. and Jamal Murray if they want to even the series. Perhaps more importantly, the Nuggets will have to find a way to slow down Minnesota's offensive attack outside of Edwards. Karl-Anthony Towns, Mike Connelly and Naz Reid did damage in the second half that ultimately spelled doom for the Nuggets in game one. It will take everything they've got, but this is a must win.\n\nHow to watch/listen: Denver Stiffs does not condone piracy...unless it's the romanticized 18th century type. TNT. League Pass for non-Nuggets market viewers. 92.5 FM KKSE Altitude Sports Radio.\n\nDespite everything that Edwards did, Reid may have been the biggest factor in Minnesota making their push in the second half. He was able to get to the hoop when needed, he could stretch the floor by knocking down three pointers and ended up with 16 points all in the second half. Meanwhile, the Nuggets bench continues to be a struggle. Reggie Jackson had his moments as did Christian Braun but Peyton Watson was a complete no-show and Justin Holiday continues to struggle with his outside shot. If the Nuggets are going to win this series they have to find some sort of production off of their bench. Unfortunately, there's little time to get it figured out. The Nuggets do have Julian Strother available and perhaps he could inject some offense & shooting into their bench group. However, he is still a rookie and has played sparingly for most of the season. I'm not sure that placing him into these high stakes games is the best way to go. Still, the Nuggets need to figure this out if they have any chance of winning the series or even this game tonight.\n\nThe thing to remember: no time to feel sorry for yourself\n\nTeams come back from down 1-0 all the time, including when it's the home team who loses the first game. That being said, coming back from two games to nothing after losing both games on your home court is a nigh impossible task. The Nuggets need to come out of the gate with focus. Everybody in the crowd will know that this is a must win game and I have no doubt that the crowd will be ready to do their part but if we start another game with everybody standing for over two minutes, waiting for the Nuggets to hit their first basket, it's going to take the air out of the arena just like it did in game one. Momentum is the key for the Nuggets winning this game against the Timberwolves. Minnesota wants to set their defense and be able to pick the matchups that work best for them. If the Nuggets can get out on the run and make baskets in transition or even just force Minnesota to play fast and not get a chance to set their defense exactly the way they want then Denver will come away with a victory. That starts with getting off to a good start and keeping your crowd engaged.\n\nThe thing to bet: Aaron Gordon over 6.5 rebounds (-105)", "source": {"uri": "denverstiffs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver Stiffs"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_mikash@denverstiffs.com", "name": "Zach Mikash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Braun_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Braun (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKSE_(AM)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KKSE (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_Sports_and_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altitude Sports and Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.denverstiffs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/preview-feature-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Looking at 6x All-Star's status for Game 2 (May 6)", "body": "The Denver Nuggets have listed Nikola Jokic as available for Game 2 of the Western Conference's semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets, along with Nikola Jokic, recognize the distinctive challenge that Minnesota presents. The season series between the teams ended tied at 2-2. Now, the Nuggets are approaching this next game with a must-win attitude, as they aim to avoid dropping the first two home games.\n\nIn Game 1, Jokic scored 32 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. However, his shooting was not as efficient as normal; he hit 44.0% of his field goals and 22.0% of his three-pointers, both of which were lower than his season average. He was subjected to continuous double teams while Gobert patrolled the rim.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. has been exceptionally accurate from beyond the arc in the playoffs, sinking four 3-pointers in Game 1. Porter totaled 20 points, shooting 6-13, including 4-7 from beyond the arc.\n\nJamal Murray had a subdued first half but ended the game with 17 points. Meanwhile, the role players were quiet; Aaron Gordon scored just nine points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope contributed six.\n\nDenver leans heavily on its starters, with Christian Braun making the most significant contribution off the bench by scoring seven points. Reggie Jackson and Justin Holiday were the only other bench players to add to the score.\n\nDenver is ranked fourth in offensive efficiency and ninth in defensive efficiency, while their pace of play is ranked 27th in the league.\n\nWhat happened to Nikola Jokic?\n\nNikola Jokic has proven to be exceptionally durable throughout the season, missing only three of his 82 games. His absences were primarily due to left hip inflammation, an issue that has been recurrent since 2017.\n\nJokic, who was first listed as questionable, was eventually ruled out for a March 23 game against the Portland Trail Blazers. He managed his hip inflammation for the following two games before being added to the injury report again in April.\n\nAdditionally, he sat out against the LA Clippers on Nov. 27 and the OKC Thunder on Jan. 31.

On Saturday night, the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves raised their gloves and sized each other up as the opening bell sounded off round one of the best-of-seven brawl. It's a heavy-weight fight, with Minnesota landing the first blow, going up 18-4, only to be met with a devastating counter as Denver answered with a 21-3 run.\n\nThe two colossal titans of the NBA met each other toe to toe as each tried to assert their dominance. Minnesota's feverish tenacity defensively continually forced Denver to earn every inch. As the fourth quarter progressed, the Nuggets fatigue became their downfall. Unable to keep Anthony Edwards at bay, the awe-inspiring superstar erupted for 43 on 58.6% shooting. Naz Reid obliterated all resistance in the fourth quarter, scoring 14 points in the quarter as the Timberwolves took command of the game.\n\nBefore the playoffs began, pundits expressed doubt in the 56-26 Wolves. Dropping the final regular season game to Phoenix Suns, most experts across the basketball media channels neglect to award their stamp of approval for Minnesota. Drawing the very team that had beaten them a few days prior, few thought the talented Suns would make short work of the immature Timberwolves whose best defender couldn't stay on the court in the playoffs.\n\nTalk about a miss.\n\nThe Timberwolves' dismantling of the Suns radiated the Edwards' glow to basketball fans across the world. Instead of acknowledging how dangerous of a threat the entire Wolves basketball team roster had become, the narrative was fixated on the team who'd been incinerated. In an abrupt change of heart, Phoenix was no longer the quality of opponent they once were thought to be. It left a hungry pack of Wolves only one option to capture the full attention of the NBA, to beat the Nuggets in Denver.\n\nSo get your head on a swivel NBA, this Timberwolves team has mortalized Nikola Joki\u0107 and the Nuggets. It's a statement win to steal a game in Denver, but the job is not done. That now makes five consecutive focused, business-like mentality approach from this Timberwolves squad. The growth in maturity from Edwards, Karl Anthony-Towns, and Jaden McDaniels has shot the Timberwolves' baseline into the stratosphere. Always seemingly within striking distance thanks to their consistently destructive defense, the Timberwolves' wealth of depth and selfless offense has continued to deliver a flawless playoff record.\n\nThis is an incredibly rewarding win over the Nuggets, so celebrate it. Now, it's time to turn the page and lock in for Game 2. The Timberwolves need to continue their persistent energy and poise. This team's maturity will continue to be tested, and their focus must never wane from the challenge at hand. Let's dive into how the Timberwolves can land a body blow and go up 2-0 in the series.\n\nThe Nuggets are the gold standard of team play and the ability to generate high-quality shots. The Timberwolves are an incredibly challenging team to decipher on the defensive end. Harboring a fleet of defenders with exceptional length and size, the Wolves can rotate multiple defenders on opposing stars to keep them from settling in on a matchup. Between Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray, the Nuggets possess boundless levels of basketball IQ. The two will continue to probe Minnesota's defenses and test for weak spots. Lethal sharpshooter Michael Porter Jr. stalks the perimeter. With a knack for timing, the lengthy wing doesn't need much space to get a quality shot off.\n\nJoki\u0107 worked to his limit in Game 1 and the Nuggets need to find a way to get more offense outside of their two-time MVP. Denver is at their best when the ball is flowing and finding multiple players in a quality position to attack, shoot, or pass. The Timberwolves successfully stalled promising attacks with their ability to stay in position to maximize their length, forcing the Nuggets into stickier actions and late shot-clock situations.\n\nDenver's starting five were all a collective negative on the box score. Murray has struggled to impact the game to his typical standard. The Nuggets star, best known for his knack for making tough shots in key moments, has been working through a nagging left calf strain. Going 6-14 from the field and a lowly -22 for the game, Murray clearly lacked his normal explosion and as a result struggled to navigate the Timberwolves' defense. His health is paramount to the Nuggets ' aspirations of defending their crown. Murray's ability to probe and warp a defense creates open shots or attacking opportunities for his teammates. His struggles reverberate through the lineup and disrupt the Nuggets' offensive flow.\n\nExpect Denver to show Minnesota a few new offensive sets. If they can find some weaker spots in the Timberwolves defense, the entire floor should open up more.\n\nSince Edwards arrived in Minnesota, he has continued to ascend to the heights of greatness. Along the way, he's dragged this Timberwolves franchise right out of the mud and up onto a pedestal. Pulverizing the Suns in the first round with 31 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, marquee influencers in the basketball world began to sign the rising phenom's praises. Some go as far as comparing Edwards to the legendary Michael Jordan.\n\nSome would say this was all getting to be a bit much, and the Edwards hype train was reaching too far. It becomes hard to deny the idea when Ant continues to deliver breathtaking performances. Edwards' blistering game 1 performance overwhelmed the defending champions. In a game featuring the best player in the world in Joki\u0107, it was Edwards who commanded the spotlight and was clearly the strongest force on the floor. The thought that Edwards could match Joki\u0107 was a prospect hopeful in nature but in game one Edwards sparked hope that he indeed continues to rise to the moment.\n\nIt goes beyond the 43 points scored in Game 1. As Edwards emerges as one of the premier shotmakers in the NBA, his defense equally continues to level up.\n\nEdwards is playing confident, tenacious, and mature basketball. Taking what the game gives him and punishing opportunistic matchups while playing soul-crushing defends, Edwards sets the tone for his team. Ant is forcing his way into the conversation of being one of the best basketball players in the world, and it's a development that could propel the Wolves into beating the defending champion Nuggets.\n\nNow, the 22-year-old superstar needs to continue to play smart basketball. Denver does not have a bevy of options to throw at him defensively so continue to stay aggressive and attack. Expect Edwards to be in attack mode early and often. If Denver counters by moving Gordon off Towns and up on Ant, then it's up to Towns to capitalize on his favorable matchup. Punish that decision, and make Denver be forced to live with Edwards.\n\nTowns has struggled with foul trouble in four of five playoff games this year. When on the court, KAT has positively impacted the game with reliable defense and efficient, under-control offense. His 11 third-quarter points stabilized the game for the Wolves as the defense continued to wear down the Nuggets. The defense needs to stay locked in. Ensure Murray doesn't get anything easy, and contest every shot. Murray is clearly less than 100% healthy, so persistent pressure and rotating defensive bodies should keep Murray from settling into the game.\n\nThe Timberwolves did a fantastic job forcing Denver to work on both offense and defense. Minnesota's defense routinely disrupted Denver's primary actions and forced them into tough shots or secondary actions. The Wolves out-rebounded the Nuggets 42-34, while the bench scored 23 to Denver's 15. The physicality was palpable, and the Wolves were prepared to answer. Most importantly, the Timberwolves need to continue to force Joki\u0107 to be a scorer and take away passing lanes. Denver is at their best when the soon-to-be three-time MVP can pull the strings, so ensure there are no strings to pull.\n\nThe Timberwolves have landed the first blow. If we didn't before, we have their full attention now. Expect desperation from Denver to hit back and capture a game before heading to Minneapolis. On the contrary, the Timberwolves have an opportunity to establish a commanding 2-0 lead on the defending champions before heading home to play in from of the roaring Target Center. We know what this team is capable of, it's up to them to continue to find consistency every night, with or without Rudy Gobert.", "source": {"uri": "canishoopus.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canis Hoopus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EH7fj86hjqJCwqLqoDq6dMfpWWQ=/0x0:4221x2111/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435777/2151519237.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

However, it will take more for the reigning champs to get past the Minnesota Timberwolves in what already looks like a tough second-round playoff series. Michael Porter Jr. showed in Saturday's Game 1 loss he could be Denver's X-factor.\n\nAlthough the Nuggets took a 106-99 loss to open the series and surrendered home-court advantage in the process, this series is far from over. Murray is not 100% healthy and did not practice all week. He still managed to drop 17 points while being primarily guarded by Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards, but he was held scoreless in the first half.\n\nThe Timberwolves jumped out to a 14-point lead early on, but with Murray slowed, Porter stepped up to help Jokic by contributing with 13 points and the Nuggets entered halftime with a 44-40 advantage. In those first two quarters, Porter went 4-for-7 from the field with his primary defender being Jaden McDaniels - who did a solid job against Suns' Devin Booker and Kevin Durant in the first round.\n\n\"On this team I don't have the ball in my hands most of the game, so I just have to be aggressive and try to find the ball when I can and be ready to make plays,\" Porter said. \"And just be aggressive because this is a good defensive team. It's going to take a collective scoring effort to beat these guys.\"\n\nJokic finished the night with a team-high 32 points, while Porter put up 20, including four 3-pointers. Porter was the Nuggets' leading 3-point shooter this season and hit 39.7% of his attempts from long range. He'll need to keep connecting against Minnesota as the Timberwolves are the sixth best team in the league when it comes to 3-point defense.\n\nPorter has been averaging 22.3 points per contest while shooting 53.9% from the field and an eye-popping 50% (24 for 48) from 3-point range during the playoffs. The numbers are already impressive, and become even more noteworthy given the fact that Porter is also dealing with some difficult off-court issues involving his brothers. Nuggets head coach Michael Malone has given him a lot of credit for showing up for the team and said it spoke to his strength.\n\nPorter averaged 16.7 points during the regular season, so his efforts are already clearly showing up on the stat sheet. Murray worsened his injury during Game 4 against the Lakers and, although he had two game-winners in that first-round series, he is not looking quite like himself yet and the team will need Porter -- along with others on the team -- to continue to step up.

This win shifts the home-court advantage to the Timberwolves. They now have the opportunity to extend their lead to 2-0 in the series during Monday night's second game.\n\nThe Timberwolves have kicked off this playoff season with five consecutive wins, each decisively. Minnesota executed a strong strategy in the game's final moments, prompting the Nuggets to commit the kinds of mistakes they typically force on their opponents.\n\nThe onus is now on the Nuggets to adjust and keep an eye on Jamal Murray's calf injury. Murray has struggled with his shooting through six playoff games. Anthony Edwards has excelled during the postseason. He dominated in Game 1, scoring 25 of his total 43 points in the first half, showcasing his significant impact on the court.\n\nWhenever Denver assigned double coverage to Edwards, he skillfully located open teammates who could take the shot. Notably, Naz Reid contributed significantly, scoring 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, which included two crucial 3-pointers.\n\nThe Timberwolves recognize Nikola Jokic's threat, as shown by the considerable attention he received from their defenders. Minnesota employed big men like Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid to guard Jokic, often sending double teams his way when he positioned himself in the paint area.\n\nWhat happened to Anthony Edwards?\n\nDuring a third-quarter play in the Utah Jazz game on March 18, Edwards took advantage of a clear lane to the hoop, delivering a powerful dunk. This standout moment was highlighted when Edwards dramatically dunked over Jazz forward John Collins, energizing the crowd.\n\nHowever, the celebration was short-lived as the 22-year-old shooting guard dislocated his finger during the dunk and had to grimace his way to the locker room for treatment. The two-time All-Star has battled ankle issues all season, often listed on the team's injury report. This was apparent during the Feb. 27 game against the San Antonio Spurs, where he accidentally twisted his left ankle while trying to dodge a screen.\n\nIn the 108-106 defeat to the Orlando Magic on Feb. 2, Edwards faced another challenge with his ankle. He momentarily left the game in the first half to receive treatment for what was suspected to be a right ankle injury.

The basic concepts are there, and indeed, the Nuggets run a bunch of diverse sets that typically drive defenses mad.\n\nBut at its core, head coach Michael Malone doesn't want robotic play calls. Rather, the offense thrives off spontaneous creativity, unselfish passing and shot making that's unrivaled in the NBA.\n\nAs Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves looms on Monday night, Denver spent Sunday morning's film session contemplating what went wrong with an offense that's usually a relentless execution machine. Where the offense is smooth, Game 1 was too often choppy and disjointed. Where the offense is efficient, Saturday night's game was shocking in its inefficiency. Minnesota's swarming defense and its tentacle-like length throughout the rotation deserve a lot of the credit.\n\nBut the Nuggets on Sunday realized that they helped the process along and that if this series is to go back to Minnesota tied at one game apiece, things must improve on Monday.\n\nIt wasn't so much the inefficiency, the turnovers, the missed shots or that Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray couldn't just bail out the offense. It was more that Denver was trying to find itself offensively well into the fourth quarter. That part wasn't just surprising, it was shocking. The Nuggets are one of the best clutch offenses in the league in the last decade. And yet the clutch was when the Timberwolves were able to use an 8-0 run to stretch a 94-91 advantage into a sizable lead.\n\n\"Offensively, there were about 15 possessions where nobody had any idea what we were in,\" Malone said. \"We were not organized. We didn't space the floor. We didn't get into what we needed to. You can maybe get away with that kind of stuff in the regular season. But against a team as good as Minnesota, you simply can't afford wasted possessions.\"\n\nLooking back at Game 1, the numbers weren't that bad for Denver, which could add to the angst if you are a Nuggets fan. They shot 46.7 percent from the field and shot almost 42 percent from 3-point range. They turned the ball over just 12 times, but seven of those were from Joki\u0107. And Denver scored 55 second-half points. But in the fourth quarter, where the Nuggets usually thrive, the offense deserted them at the wrong time.\n\nSo, what happened? In which ways were the Timberwolves effective against Denver's offense? And what has to change for the Nuggets on Monday night?\n\nAs they did in a first-round sweep of the Phoenix Suns, Minnesota guarded almost 94 feet. Whether it was Murray, Joki\u0107 or Reggie Jackson initiating the offense, they had a man in their grille pressuring the dribble. Those pick-up points are higher than you normally see from an NBA defense, and it bothered the Nuggets. They consistently didn't get into their offense with a lot of time remaining on the shot clock.\n\nThat led to somewhat hurried offensive possessions, which led to the Nuggets not generating their normal quality shots. Minnesota's ability to guard the ball at an extended level caused a chain reaction the Nuggets couldn't solve in Game 1.\n\nJoki\u0107 and Murray looked tired on Saturday. The fatigue and the decision-making trickled down to the remainder of the rotation, which is why the Nuggets' success in Game 2 depends largely on improved performances from its two best players.\n\nOn Sunday, Murray largely dismissed questions about his effectiveness being compromised by the left calf he strained against the Lakers. But he was held scoreless in the first half, the first time in his professional career he hasn't scored in a half. Murray just wasn't at his best in Game 1.\n\n\"I think everyone has injuries around this time of the year,\" Murray said. \"Everyone is playing through something. My calf is no different than anybody else on the team. Obviously, it sucks, but it's not something I enjoy talking about. It's not the reason we lost the game.\"\n\nThe Nuggets are going to have to figure out a way to improve their spacing. In some ways, they let Gobert off the hook by not keeping him occupied well enough. That means possibly taking Michael Porter Jr. and putting him at the power forward spot, which would mean Christian Braun plays more off the bench. Gobert can't hang around the paint and help against Joki\u0107, especially if he needs to get to the perimeter and close out on Porter or Braun.\n\nThe Nuggets can't do this exclusively because Aaron Gordon is too good and too important to be sitting on the bench. He also does a terrific job defensively against Towns and needs to spend an extensive amount on Edwards. But, the Nuggets have gone to Porter Jr. at power forward in the past to increase spacing, and in doses, this is a logical adjustment to try and loosen up the paint.\n\nDenver's Game 2 offense needs to be just as physical as Minnesota's defense. The Nuggets didn't play with enough force, but they also played sloppy basketball without enough precision. The Timberwolves might be the best defensive team in the league, but the Nuggets might have the best offense.\n\n\"This is what the playoffs are about,\" Jackson said. \"It's fun. It's fun to look yourself in the mirror and see how you can get better.

Mandatory Credit: Jim Rassol-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe single biggest thorn in the side of the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves is no other than Anthony Edwards. The young Timberwolves star punished the Nuggets for 43 points on 17/29 shooting from the field in Minnesota's 106-99 road win in Game 1 of the series.\n\nDenver Nuggets' Michael Malone Accepts the Anthony Edwards Reality in the Series\n\n\"He's going to get his,\" Malone said (via Harrison Wind DNVR Sports) of Edwards, who has been unstoppable in the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nEdwards is undoubtedly a big reason for the success the Timberwolves are having in the playoffs. However, Malone also seemed to indicate that Edwards doesn't bother him as much as the other guys on Minnesota's roster. Malone appears to have long accepted that Edwards will be the one constant force in the series, so what worries him more is someone like Mike Conley Jr. having a field day against Denver's defense just like in the series opener.\n\n\"If you allow Conley and Towns and Naz Reid to have the impact they had in the 2nd half, that's going to make it really problematic,\" Malone said. \"I'm worried more about the other guys.\"\n\nConley chipped in 14 points on 5/8 shooting with three 3-pointers in Game 1, while Naz Reid came off the bench and fired 16 points on 7/11 shooting.\n\nAt the end of the day, Edwards is who the Timberwolves' offense will revolve around, so the Nuggets still need to find a way to slow the former No. 1 overall pick down. It's a tough assignment but an important one for Denver, which had not lost a Game 1 of the series since 2023 until last Saturday at the hands of the Timberwolves.\n\nFor More NBA And College Basketball Content:", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodheroics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "hardwoodheroics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaseya_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaseya Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.hardwoodheroics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/USATSI_22766605_168400517_lowres-1024x682.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-03-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Edwards has been playing like a ball of fire in the 2024 NBA Playoffs thus far. He already looks like a huge problem for the Denver Nuggets after he torched the defending NBA champions for 43 points in the series opener on Saturday night.\n\nHowever, Nuggets head coach Michael Malone wants his team to realize that Edwards isn't the only Timberwolves player killing them. Malone brought up the name of veteran point guard Mike Conley when talking about his team's outlook going forward in the series.\n\n\"You can't go under Mike Conley. There's a reason Mike Conley kicks our ass every time we play him,\" Malone told reporters (h/t Harrison Wind of DNVR Sports).\n\n\"You go under Mike Conley's screen, it's going to be a dribble left three. And we did that too often, you know, and just understanding the game plan better and the personnel that you're guarding better,\" Malone added.\n\nAlthough Conley did not go crazy offensively in Game 1, as Edwards was dropping bucket after bucket on the Nuggets, the Timberwolves vet had an efficient night himself. Conley was a fantastic source of peripheral points in that contest for Minnesota, as he finished with 14 points on 5/8 shooting from the floor with three 3-pointers on four attempts from behind the arc while also dishing out 10 assists in 31 minutes. Because of his shooting, Conley helped the Timberwolves in making the Nuggets' defense honest all game long.\n\nAs implied by Malone, it wasn't also just the first time that Conley made Denver's defense pay. Back in the regular season, Conley averaged 18.0 points and 5.3 assists in four games against the Nuggets while also shooting 62.5 percent from the field and 60.9 percent from behind the arc. Conley has been a Nuggets silent killer this season which Malone wants his team to finally contain as soon as Game 2 before the series shifts to Minnesota.\n\nNuggets in uncharted territory since 2023 title run\n\nThe Nuggets had not lost a series opener during their 2023 title run and in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs versus LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. That streak ended over the weekend at the hands of the Timberwolves, putting the Nuggets in a position they haven't been in before since 2023. But Malone is loving the challenge, as his team looks to avoid falling down a 2-0 series hole.\n\n\"I think overall that was a general consensus today was forget play call, forget anything else, man. Let's play harder. Let's be more physical. And obviously, we did not want to go back to Minnesota down 0-2. And what you love about the playoffs is this,\" Malone said about losing the first game of the series against the Timberwolves.\n\n\"Last year we never lost to Game 1. And we only lost one home game the entirety of our championship run. And we never were down 0-1. Well, this year it's different. It's a different team. It's a different setup. And now it's a new challenge. So let's embrace that. We are down. Didn't want to be, but we are. So let's fight like hell tomorrow night.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets have a 19-7 record this season in games following a loss.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Michael-Malone-breaks-down-what-doomed-Denver-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Jokic is the league's preeminent unsolvable puzzle, as there seems to be no defensive coverage in existence that has a chance in the world to slow down the Denver Nuggets star other than to hope that he misses. In fact, Jokic's greatness has gotten to the point where a comparison with one of the NBA's all-time greatest big men, Tim Duncan, doesn't seem absurd at all.\n\nAccording to former Nuggets head coach George Karl, Jokic has already \"bypassed\" the San Antonio Spurs legend in the fundamentals department. This is no mean feat, as Duncan, throughout his playing days, was known as The Big Fundamental for the way he nailed all the basics of the game -- from defensive positioning and rotations, to footwork.\n\n\"I thought that I would never say this but Tim Duncan used to be the 'fundamental guy' but Jokic has actually bypassed him because everything he does is very, very fundamental. He doesn't make many mistakes and I think that I'm blessed because I get to watch him all the time,\" Karl said when he spoke with Brandon \"Scoop B\" Robinson on the Scoop B Radio Podcast.\n\nIt's a testament to how great Nikola Jokic is that what George Karl said doesn't sound blasphemous at all. The Nuggets star has every trick in the book and every counterstrategy to every coverage, and it all boils down to a deep understanding of the game that only a few players in NBA history, such as Tim Duncan, had.\n\nNikola Jokic and Tim Duncan -- superstars who do everything to win\n\nIt may not seem obvious at first glance, but Nikola Jokic and Tim Duncan share a lot of similarities. Both are big men who allows their teams to build their offense around the post and around pick-and-rolls. The Nuggets star is the more versatile scorer, since his range extends beyond the three-point line. He is also, hands-down, the best big-man passer the world has ever seen. But Duncan is the far superior defender, as he was worthy of winning the Defensive Player of the Year in his heyday.\n\nNonetheless, the main similarity Jokic and Duncan share, according to George Karl, is the fact that the two don't hog the spotlight. They are stone-cold killers who do what is necessary to win, but they carry themselves as if they're just another member of their team.\n\n\"What I love about him is that he makes people better and he cares about how other people play; he goes out of his way to make other guys feel a part of the team. He has tremendous humility, he's a low maintenance teammate,\" Karl said of Jokic.\n\nTim Duncan was never the most marketable star in the NBA, but at his prime, he was in the running for the distinction of best player in the association. Nikola Jokic is very similar in that regard; his apparent nonchalance towards basketball grabbed headlines following the 2023 NBA Finals, and it seemed as if he would much rather tend to his horses in his farm back in Serbia than play basketball for a living.\n\nBut, like Duncan, Jokic appears to be on track to win multiple rings. The Nuggets, however, won't find their repeat bid to be a cakewalk. The Minnesota Timberwolves stand in their way in what's shaping up to be the best matchup of the second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs.\n\nThe Nuggets were on record saying that the Timberwolves posed the biggest threat to them during their run to the championship in 2023. That was lofty praise, as the Phoenix Suns had some moments against the Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers kept the Western Conference Finals very competitive.\n\nNow, the Timberwolves are looking forward to avenging their playoff exit last year. This time, they'll be having the services of Jaden McDaniels, who ended up missing the playoffs due to the broken hand he sustained out of frustration, and this would make the Timberwolves' defense an even tougher nut to crack.\n\nThe Timberwolves may be the team best suited to deal with Nikola Jokic; Rudy Gobert is as stout of a defender as it can get at the center spot, while their defensive rotations are so in sync that they could conceivably send two at the Nuggets star and still contest the shot Jokic creates.\n\nBut until further notice, Nikola Jokic is the most unstoppable player in the league. His outstanding basketball IQ allows him to be one step ahead of his opponents at all times, and the threat of his passing only accentuates his scoring acumen.\n\n\"I've always been amazed by his ability to pass the basketball. I've told people 5 years ago that he was a top 5 passer in the NBA.

As the iconic number for Carmelo Anthony and now Nikola Jokic, the former Nuggets coach says the franchise should consider honoring both players by including both of their names in the rafters.\n\n\"Two number #15 up there wouldn't bother me a bit,\" said Karl, via Brandon 'Scop B' Robinson. \"I think they are both going to be retired some time. I think he deserves to be retired. He took a team that was at the bottom and now they're at the top and it all started with the drafting of Carmelo Anthony.\"\n\nThe conversation around who should get their No. 15 jersey retired by the Nuggets is not a new one, but Nikola Jokic's continued dominance is making it harder and harder to make a case against him. In just eight years with the franchise, he brought them their first-ever NBA championship while averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game on 58.3% shooting.\n\nAs a 6x All-Star, 2x MVP, and 5x All-NBA player, Jokic is a sure-fire Hall of Famer and he's already moving up the ranks as one of the greatest Nuggets players ever. Of course, Carmelo Anthony never reached nearly the same heights as Jokic and he's taken the Nuggets further than anyone else before.\n\nBut it was Melo where the foundation was laid for the Nuggets' success and it was his tenure there that resulted in some of the franchise's best seasons. While he was never able to win a championship with the Nuggets, he did ultimately leave behind a legacy that should be celebrated, and George Karl, who coached Anthony on the Nuggets, would know more than anyone the kind of compact he had on the franchise.\n\nCarmelo Says The Nuggets Gave Away His Number Out Of \"Spite\"\n\nWhile Jokic is almost guaranteed to have his jersey retired, the situation isn't as simple with Carmelo. Many were surprised when the Nuggets let Jokic wear 15 after being drafted in 2014 and Melo says they only did it out of spite.\n\nAccording to the former Nuggets swingman, they wanted to erase his legacy by letting Jokic completely overshadow his career. And while Jokic's play has indeed minimized Anthony's legacy, it's hard to believe they planned this from the start.\n\nJokic was a second-round pick that year and nobody had a clue how good he would become. As team owner/governor Nuggets Josh Kroenke later pointed out, giving Jokic 15 was just something he never thought about and Jokic's ascension into one of the greatest players ever was something that not even Jokic himself could have predicted.\n\nHad Carmelo not requested a trade in 2009 and forced his way out, he might have had a chance to build a similar legacy with the Nuggets but he never gave himself the chance and now he'll have to live with the consequences.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_martinez@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Nico Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MTQ3NTY4MDcxMzUzNDE2/348387765_919686519131411_1311479583675575695_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Oust the reigning MVP himself.\n\n***\n\nVinny Benedetto, Nuggets beat writer\n\nAnswer: Victor Wembanyama\n\nIt might take a couple of years, but the NBA will soon be Wemby's World.\n\nNikola Jokic is about to win his third MVP in the last four years, and many believe this should be his fourth consecutive award. He's got at least a couple more years of being the MVP favorite, and the new 65-games-player requirement works in the favor of one of the game's most reliable superstars. As soon as that era is over, Wembanyama will be well-positioned to continue the trend of foreign-born MVPs.\n\nThe 20-year-old announced his NBA arrival by averaging a double-double with a league-best 3.6 blocks per game, despite getting off to a slower start than he would've liked. Wembanyama's last five games showed what's coming. He averaged 25 points, 12.8 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 5.6 blocks in that stretch, which included a couple of games against the Nuggets and the best player in the world - for now.\n\nEverything is on the table for Wembanyama from quadruple-doubles - he was one block and two assists away from one against Jokic and the Nuggets on April 2 - to becoming the first player since Hakeem Olajuwon to regularly to record at least five points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals and five blocks in a game.\n\nSan Antonio is still a few years away from filling out a roster to support Wembanyama's MVP case, but with another valuable first-round pick incoming and friendly cap situation, that shouldn't be an issue by the time Jokic gives up the throne a few years from now. Wembanyama will be stronger, and a better shooter, by that time. When that happens, the 7-foot-4 alien will be ready to take over the basketball world.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was just the second home playoff loss for Denver in the last two seasons (the only other one being Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat last year).\n\nWhile Jokic still managed to post 32 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists Saturday, he was bothered by Minnesota's frontcourt brigade of three-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, four-time All-Star and former No. 1 overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns, and newly-minted Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid. the trio made it difficult for Jokic on the glass and clogged up his passing lanes. As a result, Jokic finished in single figures in both rebounds and assists for just the tenth time all year (with one of those times being because he was ejected mid-game).\n\nAfter the game, Jokic was asked how he could better deal with the Gobert-Towns-Reid trio going forward in the series.\n\n\"To have a duplicate clone of myself,\" Jokic hilariously replied.\n\nJokic's response was obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the greater point stands -- he needs some more help. Denver's Aaron Gordon dominated the interior all season from the dunker's spot, but at 6-foot-8, he is not nearly as effective against Minnesota's gigantor frontline. Meanwhile, the 6-foot-10 Michael Porter Jr. is much more of a perimeter player, and the 6-foot-11 DeAndre Jordan, Jokic's backup center, is pretty ancient at this point.\n\nWhen it comes to cloning himself, Jokic might be in luck there since he was two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, who are even bigger than he is.

Murray rubbed off Gordon's screen to collect a handoff from Jokic and then, when the Timberwolves blitzed, passed back to Jokic for a two-on-one opportunity at the rim. When Jokic catches the ball in this position, with this much space in front of him, nobody ever stops him: Either the two-time MVP will sink a floater or toss an alley-oop to Gordon.\n\nAnd yet, on this crucial crunch-time play, the Timberwolves did stop him. Soon-to-be four-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert feigned toward Jokic, induced the pass, and rocked back to swat it away. Minnesota stole the ball, clinched a Game 1 victory on the road, and welcomed the second round of the playoffs with open, searching arms.\n\nThe reigning champs are on the ropes, but that's not the only key NBA storyline coming out of the weekend. Here is one thought on each second-round series as the postseason rolls on toward its climax.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 43 points in Denver on Saturday -- his third straight outing of 36 or more, as the 22-year-old star continues his rapid ascension. Edwards wasn't alone on Saturday, as the other Wolves in his pack got going after Edwards scored 25 of the team's 40 first-half points. In the second half, Karl-Anthony Towns, Mike Conley, and Naz Reid combined to score 41 points on 17-for-19 (!) shooting.\n\nBut Edwards led the charge, and Denver's most urgent priority before Game 2 on Monday night is figuring out how to slow down the rampaging youngster. \"There's no weaknesses in his game,\" Nuggets coach Mike Malone said after Game 1. \"And it's going to be a hell of a challenge trying to slow him down.\"\n\nThe Nuggets' general strategy to corral Edwards looked the same in Game 1 as it did in this regular season and in the playoffs last year. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the primary point-of-attack defender, while Gordon -- the Nuggets' top option against bigger wings -- only rarely guarded the Timberwolves' leading scorer.\n\n(The \"Everyone Else\" category might seem larger than expected because the Nuggets try to match up KCP on Edwards whenever they can. But in the modern NBA, with switches and rotations and transition mismatches and substitution patterns, stars don't face just one primary defender on every possession. It's almost always a broader team effort.)\n\nThe concern for Denver, though, is that Edwards has developed into too smart a passer to double, yet simultaneously too strong and physical a one-on-one scorer for Caldwell-Pope to contain alone. In Game 1, Edwards was able to knock back KCP and create separation for turnaround jumpers whenever he wanted.\n\nThat move wouldn't come as easily against Gordon, who is three inches taller and some 30 pounds heavier than Caldwell-Pope. The obvious adjustment for Malone would be to stick Gordon on Edwards instead.\n\nBut Edwards is so skilled that a different defender might not be a panacea. In their infrequent battles this season, Edwards has used his agility and shiftiness to slither around the bigger Gordon.\n\nLook at the fancy footwork on these buckets!\n\nIn Game 1, Edwards blew by Gordon for a layup in semi-transition.\n\nAnd in the fourth quarter, he fooled Gordon with a double crossover to create space for an open jumper.\n\nShifting Gordon onto Edwards would yield further ripple effects. Michael Porter Jr. -- enjoying an incredible postseason thus far -- looms as a crucial component of that theoretical strategy, as he'd likely need to switch onto Towns if the Nuggets use Gordon to quench Edwards's flames. Porter should be able to handle that matchup; he's an underrated defender who, at 6-foot-10, doesn't give up much size to Towns. When Porter looks stiff on defense, it's often when he's matched up against quicker wings on the perimeter, and that isn't KAT's game.\n\nBut that would be Plan B for the Nuggets, who for so long now have succeeded by sticking to Plan A and dictating the matchups they want. Edwards might be the first to force Denver to adjust.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers accomplished the bare minimum. It might have been uncomfortable, and it might have required a double-digit comeback in Game 7, but the Cavaliers did it: After tanking on the final day of the regular season and handpicking the Orlando Magic as their first-round opponent, Cleveland won a playoff series without LeBron James for the first time since 1993.\n\nThat first-in-three-decades achievement will probably be all the Cavaliers get in this postseason, though, because the top-seeded Boston Celtics await in the second round after dispatching the Jimmy Butler-less Heat with ease. Donovan Mitchell averaged 29 points per game against Orlando (including a combined 89 across Games 6 and 7) despite spotty 3-point shooting (25 percent in the series), but none of his teammates were as up to the task: Jarrett Allen, who missed the final three games with a rib injury, was the only other Cavalier to average more than 15 points per game.\n\nThat forced heliocentrism won't cut it against the Celtics, who can throw waves of elite perimeter defenders at Mitchell. Which means, once again, this will be an opportunity for Evan Mobley to make a leap.\n\nIt seems like the former no. 3 pick has already experienced -- and squandered -- many such opportunities, even though he's only in his third season. But after entering the NBA with a tremendous two-way rookie season, Mobley's development has largely stalled, especially on offense. Look no further than the just-concluded series against the Magic, as Mobley sank two 3-pointers in the opening minutes of Game 1 -- but finished the series just 3-for-11 from distance and didn't attempt a single 3-pointer over the final four games.\n\nWith Allen injured, Mobley was able to operate as the Cavaliers' lone big -- an important barometer as Cleveland approaches a critical offseason. In that configuration, his lack of a jump shot wasn't as harmful to Cleveland's spacing, and his rim protection shone; Mobley tallied 12 blocks in the final three games of the series.\n\nBut Mobley will have his work cut out for him against Boston, even with the Celtics' smaller front line diminished by Kristaps Porzingis's calf injury. The Celtics pose a very different defensive challenge than the Magic. Orlando led the league in rim attempts this season, per Cleaning the Glass, while Boston ranked just 26th; conversely, Orlando ranked 30th in made 3-pointers, while Boston ranked first. Mobley might be able to stop layups -- but Mitchell, Darius Garland, and the rest of the Cavaliers' mediocre perimeter corps probably won't be able to stop Boston's 3s.\n\nStop me if you've heard this one before: Tom Thibodeau is playing his guys heavy minutes. Josh Hart leads the league with 46.4 minutes per game in this postseason; Jalen Brunson ranks third, at 43.8; and OG Anunoby is seventh, at 41.6.\n\nIt doesn't help that the Knicks survived an incredibly close series against the 76ers, with no blowouts and an overtime game mixed in. And already missing Julius Randle, the team's rotation shrank even more midway through the first round, when Bojan Bogdanovic underwent foot surgery. Thibodeau used only seven players in both Games 5 and 6; no other team has used so few players in any game yet this postseason.\n\nJust how big of a problem is that workload for the Knicks, as they prepare to face the Pacers in the second round? Across all of their playoff games so far, the Knicks have devoted 94.5 percent of their minutes to their top seven players (the starters, plus Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride). Out of 400 playoff teams this century, that's the 13th-highest proportion. And all of the teams ahead of them played more than a decade ago, likely because a slower pace back then meant less per-minute exertion for players with more raw minutes played.\n\nThe most recent team with a shallower rotation than these Knicks was the 2014 Bulls, who devoted 95.8 percent of their minutes to seven players in a first-round defeat. Of course that team was coached by Thibodeau, too.\n\nFor greater context, the average 2024 playoff team has allocated 88 percent of its minutes to seven players, which is 6 percentage points shy of the Knicks' proportion. That doesn't sound like a major difference, but it amounts to about 15 extra minutes per game that Thibs is piling onto his core instead of spreading to role players like Precious Achiuwa or Alec Burks. Those extra minutes add up, and Thibodeau would do well to widen his rotation a bit against the fast-paced (pun intended) Pacers -- at least early in the series, so he can explore whether this is the right matchup for an athlete like Achiuwa.\n\nTo Thibs's credit, however, the Knicks aren't complete anomalies in how much playing time they're concentrating in a small group. Just last year, a prominent playoff team thrived with a strong starting lineup and shallow bench. It helped that this team tended to win its series early, so its players could rest more between rounds and not rack up excessive minutes loads. But just by proportion of minutes played, the 2023-24 Knicks look a lot like the 2022-23 Nuggets, whose top-heavy minutes allocation for their five starters, Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green didn't stop them from winning the championship.\n\nThe second-round clash between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Dallas Mavericks doubles as a battle for the title of best point guard in the NBA. Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were the two guards named to the All-NBA First Team last season, and surely will be again this season; they rank second and fourth, respectively, on The Ringer's Top 100 Player Rankings, well ahead of any other guards.\n\nLuka and SGA might not go mano a mano all that much in this series, because neither lead guard will be the other's primary defender. (I can't wait to watch Lu Dort harass Doncic over all 94 feet after he tormented Brandon Ingram in the first round; how quickly will Dort draw a Doncic technical foul when the latter complains about the lack of a whistle?) But after targeted switches or in transition, they'll invariably be drawn against one another on occasion -- and then the fun and head-to-head duels will really begin.\n\nDoncic and Gilgeous-Alexander ranked first and second this season, respectively, in points per game off isolations, which leads to a natural question: Which will fare better at stopping the other, if left alone on a key possession?\n\nOn the one hand, Gilgeous-Alexander is an accomplished defender who tied for the league lead in steals this season. On the other, Luka is a stout isolation defender, despite occasional difficulties off the ball. Doncic allowed only 0.76 points per iso this season, which ranked 15th out of 109 players with at least 50 isos defended, according to Synergy data on NBA.com. Other, much more heralded defenders ended up in Luka's vicinity, including Jayson Tatum (0.73 points per iso), Mikal Bridges (0.74), Evan Mobley (0.75), Bam Adebayo (0.77), Dort (0.77), and Alex Caruso (0.78).\n\nAnother area to watch in this series -- and another reason the two lead guards are such interesting foils -- is the turnover battle. As I noted in a playoff preview last month, the Thunder forced the most turnovers in the league this season, per CtG, and committed the third fewest. That combination led to an extra 5.7 points per game off turnovers -- by far the largest margin in the league. Plus-5.7 points off turnovers was more than the second- and third-best teams did combined.\n\nAnd then Oklahoma City nearly doubled that already-best-in-the-league margin in the first round of the playoffs. In their sweep of New Orleans, the Thunder forced turnovers on 19 percent of the Pelicans' possessions, which led to 19.8 points off turnovers per game. Meanwhile, the Thunder allowed only 9.3 points off their own turnovers, producing, once again, the league's largest margin by far.\n\nBut as that graph shows, the second-greatest advantage in points off turnovers in the first round belonged to Dallas, which has always limited turnovers with Luka on the roster. The Mavericks have finished with a top-five lowest turnover rate in each of the last five seasons, per CtG. Limiting Oklahoma City's chances to get out in transition would give Dallas one of the boosts it needs to upset the West's top seed.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There will be no shortage of excitement, but we'll have limited DFS options with just the two games on the schedule.\n\nThe key to being successful in NBA DFS comes down to making adjustments during the day as injury information becomes available. But it's always really important to have a game plan, and the best players and spots circled first before making those adjustments. To keep up with all the latest developments and get access to updated projections, grab an NBA season pass and also gain access to our RotoBaller Premium Discord, where @chiefjustice6 is talking about the slate up until lineups lock!\n\nThis article will provide you with my daily fantasy basketball lineup picks for DraftKings and FanDuel on 5/6/24. Remember to monitor NBA injury news and our awesome NBA injuries report tool, as the slate can completely change before lineups lock at 7:30 p.m. EDT on FanDuel and DraftKings.\n\nNikola Jokic narrowly missed a triple-double in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, posting 32 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, and three steals across 41 minutes. Over four matchups with the Timberwolves during the regular season, Jokic averaged 33.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 4.3 assists. The Nuggets can't afford to go down 0-2 with the series then shifting to Minnesota, so look for Jokic to provide a monster stat line as he tries to carry them to a victory.\n\nAs good as Jokic was in Game 1, Anthony Edwards was even better. He scored 43 points, shooting 17-for-29 from the field. He has scored at least 33 points in four of his last five games and is averaging 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.8 steals during the playoffs. With his massive usage rate, expect him to continue to have a high floor.\n\nJosh Hart barely comes off the floor for the Knicks. After being moved into the starting lineup, he averaged 40 minutes over his final 36 games during the regular season. In the playoffs, he has logged at least 42 minutes in each game. That helped him produce averages of 16.8 points, 12.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists. His playing time isn't going to decrease anytime soon.\n\nThe Knicks might be playing with fire when it comes to OG Anunoby, who has a checkered injury history. He has logged at least 45 minutes in three straight games and is averaging 41 minutes per game during the playoffs. With him being a key defender, and the Knicks not feeling overly confident in most of their bench players, expect Anunoby to continue to spend a ton of time on the floor.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo is a streaky shooter. He was having a rough series against the 76ers until he broke out with 23 points in Game 6. Across three meetings with the Pacers during the regular season, DiVincenzo averaged 24.0 points and 4.3 three-pointers. If he can catch fire from behind the arc again, he could provide significant value.\n\nNaz Reid didn't play much against the Suns, logging 20 minutes or fewer in all four games. He played 23 minutes against the Nuggets in Game 1, finishing with 16 points, four rebounds, and three assists. Despite only averaging 24 minutes per game during the regular season, he averaged 13.5 points and 5.2 rebounds. His salary is cheap enough of both sites to make him a viable tournament option.\n\nJalen Brunson carried the Knicks past the 76ers. He finished off the series by scoring at least 40 points in each of the last three games. He also recorded at least 10 assists in three of the last four games. With the ball in his hands a ton and plenty of shot attempts coming his way again, it might be disastrous to fade Brunson.\n\nT.J. McConnell doesn't need a lot of playing time to have an impact. During the regular season, he averaged 10.2 points, 2.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 1.0 steals in just 18 minutes per game. He showed his upside in Game 6 versus the Bucks, recording 20 points, nine assists, and four steals over 23 minutes. His salary is so cheap that he makes for a great tournament option.\n\nThis comes down to a budget preference at shooting guard. For those who feel comfortable spending up at the position, take the reliability and stellar upside that come with Edwards. Those looking to spend down at the position should consider DiVincenzo, who will likely play plenty of minutes for the Knicks.\n\nWith Jokic and Jamal Murray garnering all the headlines, Michael Porter Jr. just continues to quietly churn out valuable stat lines. During the Nuggets' current playoff run, he has averaged 22.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.5 steals. His three-point shooting is key for their success, making him one of the more appealing mid-tier salary forwards.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns has scored at least 18 points in four of the Timberwolves' five playoff games. He posted 20 points in Game 1 against the Nuggets, hitting two three-pointers along the way. With the Nuggets focusing their efforts on trying to slow down Edwards, it will be important for Towns to continue to try and take some of the scoring load off his shoulders.\n\nTop PF Options:\n\nJokic has an incredibly high floor with his ability to contribute in multiple areas. Even with his lofty salary on both sites, it's difficult to justify fading him. Building your entire lineup around him could be key, especially in cash games. However, for those who want to fade him in tournament play and spend up for guards and forwards, don't sleep on Reid.\n\nHere is where I leave you with some of my favorites.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_barner@rotoballer.com", "name": "Mike Barner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

He sank multiple dagger midrange, fadeaway jumpers in the final minutes to finish 17-for-29 with seven rebounds and three assists.\n\n\"It's tough to beat this team,\" Edwards said. \"We come in, and we know it's going to be a war. And we just stay within the game. We play within the game. They make runs, we know we've got to make our runs. We just fight, man. It's going to be a fight.\"\n\nJokic finished with a typically robust stat line -- 32 points, nine rebounds, eight assists -- but the Wolves defense was able to fluster him just enough in the final minutes to grab control of the game.\n\nReid forced Jokic, who finished with seven turnovers, to travel in the backcourt with just under eight minutes to play to set up a Wolves run. Then with the Wolves ahead 96-91 with less than three minutes left, Rudy Gobert read a lob Jokic was attempting to throw to Aaron Gordon, and Gobert came away with the steal. He also provided tough defense during a late possession that forced a Jokic miss at the rim.\n\n\"Jokic is a very, very smart player, but I think I'm a very smart defender, too,\" Gobert said. \"Sometimes you're going to win some of these, sometimes I'm going to win some of them, and just always try to stay a step ahead in those situations.\"\n\nThe Wolves also limited Denver guard Jamal Murray, who came in questionable because of a calf injury, to 17 points on 6-for-14. But even with their strong defensive effort, the Wolves likely would have lost Saturday's game in their series a season ago against Denver because of late-game execution. Game 1 was a full-throated announcement from the Wolves that they are a different team and the Nuggets are likely in for an intense battle if they want to retain their crown.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28814/2881454.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The No. 15 up there wouldn't bother me a bit... I think they are both going to be retired some time.\"\n\nKarl also said that Carmelo deserves his jersey to be retired because drafting him is what brought in a new era of the Nuggets which eventually led to Jokic being drafted and changing the franchise forever.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't make sense why the Nuggets would treat Jokic and Melo with the same level of importance when their achievements for the franchise are starkly different. If Jokic was just a top player for Denver and nothing more, the reason is more palatable. But Jokic is by far the greatest player in franchise history, so retiring his number for someone else might be disrespectful.\n\nCarmelo helped Denver put themselves on the map in the 2000s but is that something that warrants a retired jersey? They never made it past the Conference Finals with Carmelo and he forced his way out of the franchise, not achievements that find themselves rewarded with a retired jersey.\n\nCarmelo Anthony Thinks The Nuggets Gave Jokic No. 15 To Spite Him\n\nNikola Jokic has gone on to become the best player in Nuggets history and nobody comes even close to him. However, he came into the league as a second-round draft pick who was given the No. 15 shortly after Anthony's departure. Giving his jersey number to a second-round pick didn't sit well with Anthony, who thinks it was a move out of spite.\n\n\"It was a petty maneuver. It wasn't like 'Oh we got numbers to choose from.' It was like 'Here, you got 15.' And y'all put Jokic in the middle of that. He don't know what the f*ck is going on. He could have worn it because he wanted to pay homage... but what I believe is that they gave him 15 to try to erase what I did. I used to think about it. But I don't think about that sh*t no more.\"\n\nRegardless of the intention behind the move, Jokic has achieved more in that jersey than Anthony ever did. It doesn't make any sense to devalue Jokic's achievements by also giving Anthony a jersey retirement when they share the number. We never see the same number retired for two players, and the fact that Jokic would be given No. 15 as a second-round pick shows what the Nuggets think of Anthony.\n\nJokic has also revealed that he wore No. 15 his whole life and always wanted that number, as compared to being forced by Denver to wear it.\n\nCarmelo averaged 24.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in his time with the Nuggets, though Jokic has averaged 20.9 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 6.9 assists. Anthony won scoring titles and made All-Star/All-NBA teams.\n\nJokic won two league MVPs and the Finals MVP for the franchise's first-ever title triumph last season. Putting the two players on the same level is ludicrous and it wouldn't happen in any other franchise but people are emotionally attached to Carmelo.\n\nTeams like the Raptors never retired Vince Carter's number, and his impact on that city and franchise far outstrips what Anthony did in Denver. Jersey retirements are earned, and it's easy to say Jokic has deserved the honor with No. 15 on his back more than Anthony ever did.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vince Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjAzNTYxMjg2MDMyNjk3MDM1/carmelo-anthony-believes-denver-nuggets-gave-nikola-jokic-no-15-to-erase-his-legacy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Looking at Wolves forward's status for Game 2 (May 6)", "body": "Minnesota Timberwolves standout big man Karl-Anthony Towns is listed as available for the upcoming Game 2 against the Denver Nuggets of the Western Conference's semifinals on Monday.\n\nAnthony Edwards' breakout performance is shining brightly this postseason. He's averaging 33.4 points per game during the playoffs, including consecutive 40-point games.\n\nEdwards was dynamic in Game 1, scoring 43 points and grabbing seven rebounds, leading his team to a surprise victory over the defending champions.\n\nEdwards clinched the game with a coast-to-coast layup. Despite battling foul trouble towards the end of the game, Karl-Anthony Towns managed 20 points.\n\nThe Timberwolves deployed Towns defensively against Jokic, enabling Gobert to serve as a help defender and join in on double-teams against Jokic. Although Gobert scored only six points, he contributed significantly with 13 rebounds and three blocks, along with several key defensive plays.\n\nMike Conley played his part as the experienced point guard, contributing 14 points and 10 assists. While rounding out the starting five, Jaden McDaniels didn't score but excelled as a perimeter defender, pulling down eight rebounds.\n\nNaz Reid had a significant impact coming off the bench, scoring 14 of his 16 points in the final quarter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kyle Anderson were the only other bench players to see substantial minutes.\n\nMinnesota ranks 17th in offensive efficiency and leads the league in defensive efficiency. They maintain the 22nd-fastest pace in the league.\n\nWhat happened to Karl-Anthony Towns?\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns had been sidelined since March 12, following surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee. The Timberwolves said that he would be reevaluated after four weeks.\n\nThe team initially confirmed the injury, a torn meniscus in his left knee, on March 8, putting the 28-year-old sidelined for 18 games. He has missed 20 games this season.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns stats vs Denver Nuggets\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns has appeared in 23 games against the Denver Nuggets, going 10-13.\n\nHe has averaged 24.0 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists with 1.0 steals and 1.5 blocks on 53.1% shooting, 39.8% from beyond the arc on 3.8 attempts and 85.7% from the free-throw line on 5.5 attempts.\n\nOut of the four games the Wolves and the Nuggets have played each other in the regular season, Towns played just one, where he had 21 points, eight rebounds and four assists with two steals and a turnover on 36.8% shooting, 25.0% from the 3-point line and going perfect from the free-throw line.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23125352-1714997627.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-12", "textStart": 1618, "textEnd": 1626}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-08", "textStart": 1838, "textEnd": 1845}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

He had a monster Game 1 against the Denver Nuggets, but with his total trading at 28.5 on Monday, I'm playing the Under.\n\nIn these meaningful playoff games, Overs aren't typically given away to star players who are as hot as Edwards is. It doesn't mean he won't go Over the total, but for the most part, you're likely to see your edges on the Under. That's why his total has moved four points higher.\n\nAgainst the Suns before this three-game stretch, Ant's scoring prop was trading at 24.5. Following this recent outburst, we're not seeing it trade at 28.5. On top of that, this is a much different series. A game against the Nuggets isn't likely to yield as many points as a game against the Suns.\n\nThis will be uncomfortable because Edwards will still get his points; it's not like his minutes or usage will be diminished. I just think the 28.5-point mark is too high from a probability standpoint, specifically against Denver.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have other offensive advantages they can exploit outside of Edwards. The two-man game of Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert puts a lot of pressure on Nikola Jokic as a defender.\n\nAdditionally, the Timberwolves are looking to exploit Jamal Murray's defense, which means the ball will be in Mike Conley's hands plenty as well.

The Wolves were led by Anthony Edwards' 43 points as he joined some elite company in being amongst the youngest players to score 35 or more points in three straight playoff games. This is the first time since last season that the Nuggets have trailed in a playoff series, but Reggie Jackson thinks it will be fun to see if they're up for the challenge as per Dave McMenamin of ESPN.\n\n\"It makes it fun. It makes it a little tougher of course, I'm sure. The front office being here before, I'm sure they're geared up to play this team,\" Jackson said. \"It has to be fun on their end. Like, you helped build something and now you're trying to tear it apart. . .It is exciting to be in any realm of this - just to be staff, whether you're players. This is what the playoffs is about. It's fun. It's fun to go at the end of the night and look yourself in the mirror and see how you can get better.\"\n\n\"I look forward to the task and yeah, they're geared up to play against us. They know what we want to do. We know what they want to do and it's going to be a battle of will. This is really fun because it's going to be a battle of will. It's going to be a battle of attrition. Everything that you've done throughout the season and preseason and we'll find out who is going to come out swinging and who wants it the most.\"\n\nWith their Game 1 win, the Timberwolves stole homecourt advantage from the Nuggets. In order to even the series in Game and 2, the Nuggets are going to need more strong production from players like Jackson off the bench.\n\nReggie Jackson can play a key role for the Nuggets in Game 2\n\nWhen the Nuggets lost Bruce Brown and Jeff Green in free agency this past offseason, many believed that their depth had taken a hit. And for the most part that's kind of been true. The Nuggets haven't really got the same level of bench production that they did during last season's championship run.\n\nBut one player whose role has expanded this season and into the postseason in Reggie Jackson. Jackson was signed as a free agent on the buyout market last year, but didn't play that much during the Nuggets title run.\n\nThis year though, Jackson has been a key player off the bench as a backup guard. He appeared in all 82 games for the Nuggets, including 23 starts, at a little over 22 minutes per game. He averaged 10.2 points per game, 1.9 rebounds and 3.8 assists with split of 43.1 percent shooting from the field, 35.9 percent shooting from the three point line and 80.6 percent shooting from the free throw line.\n\nIn Game 1 against the Wolves, Jackson played 15 minutes off the bench and finished with five points, three rebounds, one assist and one steal while shooting 2-3 from the field and 1-1 from the three point line.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_yapkowitz@clutchpoints.com", "name": "David Yapkowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Why-Reggie-Jackson-finds-it-fun-to-be-down-1-0-to-Anthony-Edwards-Timberwolves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Jamal Murray didn't make a shot in the first half but finished with 17 points and 4 assists, while Nikola Jokic had 32 points on 25 shots, along with 8 rebounds and 9 assists. The reserves were all positives in their minutes - this loss came down to Denver's starters falling behind by 14 points in the first quarter and then getting out-executed by the Timberwolves down the stretch in the fourth. Anthony Edwards had 43 points and 7 rebounds while Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points, and Naz Reid made several big buckets in the final frame to finish with 16 points. Whatever lessons Denver needs to take from this have to be applied quickly - they've now lost home court and have to salvage a Mile-High split of the first two games on Monday.\n\nKAT picked up a foul on the opening tip, but Anthony Edwards stopped Jamal and created a three-second violation on Nikola Jokic. Both teams then missed shots before Ant buried a three over KCP. Jamal barely grazed rim on a missed corner 3, and KAT made a traditional 3-point play to make it 6-0 Minnesota. Murray missed again, then fouled Ant for another traditional 3 while Jamal passed to Aaron Gordon for a dunk. Edwards hit another 3 for a 12-2 Timberwolves lead to force a timeout, though. Out of the timeout Denver missed again and Ant finished a drive the other way for 11 early points, and Jokic missed his second shot. MPJ hit a 12 footer to stop the bleeding, but Jokic was stripped on the next drive. MPJ missed a pullup, then had a turnover on a pass out to AG as Denver just looked confused down 16-4 halfway through the quarter and Rudy Gobert's dunk made it a 14 point lead. Jokic made his first shot in 5 attempts for Denver's third bucket of the game, then MPJ's rebound turd into a Porter 3 off a Jokic screen. Gobert blocked MPJ's next shot, but Mike got a steal and Jokic got to the line a couple of times as Denver went on a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to 18-13 before a Reggie Jackson steal led to a beautiful hammer dunk by MPJ.\n\nReggie drove the hoop the next time down to cut it to 1 before Ant had another traditional 3-point play to stop Denver's run. Jackson was in a groove as he hit a step-back 3, and MPJ's free throws gave Denver its first lead at 22-21. Denver got a steal on the inbounds and Jokic buried a three over Towns as the arena roared down the stretch with Denver finishing the quarter up 25-23.\n\nPorter grabbed a rebound for Denver but missed a three to start Denver's scoring chances in the second. Jamal Murray missed his fourth shot of the game facing different defenders and playing a bit too slow. Porter made a three after getting dunked on at the other end, then Gordon got a steal off of Towns and it lead to a Christian Braun dunk. MPJ made a free throw to put Denver up 31-27, and Jokic backed down Gobert for a paint bucket. Edwards got his first bucket of the second quarter while Jokic and Reggie both missed shots before a steal turned into a Braun dunk.\n\nPeyton Watson came in with some defense and rebounding, but the lack of shooting stagnated the offense. Watson was stuffed inside by Gobert then airballed a three the next time down while Ant made a bucket, but Jokic-to-KCP resulted in a three and a 38-32 Denver lead. Ant made a three and then grabbed a steal for a layup. Jokic missed a 3, but grabbed a rebound then lead the transition for a tough bucket past Gobert. Towns hit a three for Minnesota, Gordon finished an oop off a Jokic pass, then Jokic made a paint bucket in the closing seconds to put Denver up 44-40 at the half.\n\nKAT opened the second half with a big three, but Gordon answered with a dunk, and then a Jokic steal turned into a Gordon kickout to MPJ for a three. KAT made a baseline floater, but Jamal's buzzer-beating 3 got him his first make of the game. Jokic had a layup, Conley made a layup, Ant blocked MPJ's layup, and KAT finished the other way to close Denver's lead to 54-52. Jokic got called for a charge on KAT, but KCP made a 3 to halt KAT's efforts. Jamal Murray made a circus reverse finish to get past Gobert for a bucket, and then MPJ's steal led to free throws for Jokic.\n\nMike Conley made a three, then grabbed a steal and assisted a Naz Reid dunk to tie the game at 62. Murray and Conley exchanged buckets, Holiday hit a Jokic-assisted 3, and Ant buried his first jumper of the third. He made another one to give Minny a one point lead, then a missed Denver 3 lead to a Nickeil Alexander-Walker corner 3. Ant got a ridiculous tech after a nice baseline finish, Jokic got a paint bucket but MPJ missed a 3 and Denver went into the final frame down 73-71 after the Wolves went 14-of-19 in the quarter.\n\nMPJ missed a three and KAT failed to back down AG to open the fourth, but Jamal Murray got to the line for free throws. Naz Reid had a glass finish, then MPJ's block led to a Jamal Murray finish. Reid and Gordon exchanged layups, then Jamal Murray finished a 4 point play after KAT's fifth foul on Murray's 3. Ant finished a drive to put Minnesota back up 82-81, then drained a jumper after a Jokic travel. Christian Braun finally made a three, his first in the playoffs, but Reid answered with a bank three, then dunked back an Ant miss. Jokic finished through contact to make it 89-86 Minnesota, but Reid just kept attacking with another layup. Murray hit a runner, Naz Reid hit a 3, and Jokic made a tough finish through contact to close the deficit to 3. Gobert slammed home an offense rebound then broke up an oop attempt from Jokic to AG. Gobert kissed a 15 footer in off the glass, MPJ was called for an offensive foul on a deep jumper, and then Edwards slammed the door with a stepback under 2 minutes to go to put Minnesota up 102-91. Jokic made a paint shot and then a 3 to cut it to 6, but the ending was already locked in and Minnesota won 106-99.\n\n- This is the same team that was sleep-walking to the series win over the Lakers. The problem is the Timberwolves are not the Lakers. The Nuggets came out slow and unprepared again, falling behind big early. Jamal Murray is struggling to get separation and has no afterburners whatsoever. He's having to deploy a lot of Old Man Moves that did not work in the first half and had limited effectiveness in the second. Jokic was careless with the ball tonight, with 7 turnovers to go with his 9 assists, and also lacked his customary shooting touch. The Nuggets are not going to win a series where their two main players turn the ball over a bunch and cannot find efficient ways to score.\n\n- Denver's failure in the clutch was startling. The advantage Denver always has is its ability to run the 2-man game in the waning minutes, with a kickout to MPJ or KCP for an important 3. That did not happen tonight, nor were they able to turn away the Timberwolves on the other end. Some of that is luck (Minnesota was making bank shots out to 3, Naz Reid and Mike Conley could not miss, etc), and some is just Anthony Edwards being Him, but some of it was a failure on Denver's part to force the issue. Aaron Gordon and KCP both fell short defensively. In fact, on both ends Denver was a passive acceptor of what Minnesota wanted rather than imposing themselves on either end. In a close game, the team that imposed its will won. Usually that is Denver, so they had better find that gear again if they want to win this series because Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves are not going to let the Nuggets have even one easy thing the rest of the way.\n\n- It's going to be a long series. The Timberwolves played hungry and aggressive basketball, the Nuggets for the most part did not, but the playoff adjustments will be key - as will who steps up for both teams. Denver doesn't look like they're having fun out there, and I hope they find their playoff joy again soon. Defending a title is one of the hardest things in sports, and the grind can be soul-sucking. For a long series after a very long year, the Nuggets need to find the joy in competition to match Minnesota, and that more than anything is the challenge ahead for this squad. The tight, awkward play is not their style. Fans and players alike are taking these performances hard. The Nuggets have the skills to match and exceed the Timberwolves, but the onus is on Denver to do so. The next game in that struggle is on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "denverstiffs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver Stiffs"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gordon_gross@denverstiffs.com", "name": "Gordon Gross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Braun_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Braun (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson_(basketball,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson (basketball\\, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.denverstiffs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23191172.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Plenty of value sits on the BetMGM betting market, including moneyline, spread and over/under picks.\n\nWill the Knicks continue their torrid run under Jalen Brunson and his college teammates Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo? Or, will Tyrese Haliburton and Indy carry over momentum from an impressive series victory over the hobbled Bucks?\n\nWill Anthony Edwards and the Wolves take a commanding 2-0 series lead over the defending-champion Nuggets on their floor, or will Nikola Jokic and company respond to the Game 1 upset with force?\n\nMORE BETTING:\n\nAnt-man drawing MJ comps after Game 1 upset | Knicks unbeatable with OG?\n\nSporting News has identified the top-value bets on BetMGM for Monday night's NBA playoff action. Let's get right to the best moneyline, spread, over/under, and player prop bets for Monday.\n\nThe Nuggets should come out guns blazing tonight, as they know how important it will be to avoid going down 2-0 at home to start a series. Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid were hot fire last game, but will they be that special in Game 2?\n\nDenver tends to rebound well after postseason losses. The Nuggets have led at the end of five of the past six halves of games directly following playoff losses, and many of those leads were humongous. Bet on Nikola Jokic and the reigning champions to get back into the swing of things in front of a raucous crowd at Ball Arena, where Denver went 33-8 this season.\n\nA quick look at New York's home splits and Indy's road splits both straight up and against the spread indicates that every point literally matters.\n\nSee? The Knicks are great straight up at home, but give the opponent a bunch of points and they're barely breaking even. Similarly, the Pacers have gone under .500 on the road but over .500 ATS in away games. That's why the best bet against the spread is to buy New York three points and take the Knicks to win by three.\n\nEveryone loves the OVER, but there are plenty of reasons to hate it tonight. Indiana being the top scoring team in the NBA always seems to over-inflate its projected totals, but it's important to understand that almost every team clamps down on defense a little more in the postseason. Scoring is way down in the playoffs in general.\n\nThe betting trends throughout the season support the UNDER, too. The OVER has gone just 17-27 in Knicks home games and 18-23-2 in Pacers road games. The UNDER also hit each of the past two times these teams met (Feb. 1 and Feb. 10 in NY), and it's 13-5 over the past 18 times they have dueled at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIt's time to deploy the triple-dub bets, people! It's a rare sight for Denver to trail a playoff series these days -- it didn't happen at all during the Nuggets' incredible 16-4 run to the title last year. However, the Wolves have Michael Malone's squad on the ropes, so the biggest hoops heavyweight in the world has to start delivering some haymakers.\n\nMinnesota maintained the No. 1 defense in the Association all season, and will be extra confident after punching Denver in the mouth in Game 1. Don't expect Jokic to drop 50 points or anything, but do expect him to get everyone going and to go extra hard on the offensive and defensive glass.\n\nLook at Joker's stats after a loss this season: 26.4 points, 12.4 rebound, 9.0 assists.

Even as they gave away homecourt advantage on the very first match of their semifinal round series against the resplendent Timberwolves, he remained cognizant of their capacity to keep track of what avid followers of the pro scene would describe as time and score. Anything can happen in any given game, let alone a best-of-seven affair -- and there's still a lot of hoops left to be played.\n\nJokic is right, of course, and not simply because he's slated to claim his third Most Valuable Player award in four years. In spearheading the cause of the Nuggets, he knows full well the value of the experience they have as defending champions vis-a-vis the relatively wet-behind-the-ears Timberwolves. It's why he refuses to get too low following setbacks, or too high in the face of victories. That said, he's no fool, and understands the severity of the hurdles they need to overcome if they are to succeed in their quest to retain their title.\n\nCertainly, the Nuggets need to be at their best in order for them to take the measure of the competition. In a postseason where the typical names on the marquee -- LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry included -- have been compelled to take in the action from afar, the Timberwolves represent a veritable changing of the guard. The latter brandished broomsticks in the first round versus the vaunted Suns, with the outcome of Game One serving to extend a pristine slate in the 2024 Playoffs. And leading the charge is certified megastar Anthony Edwards, whose utter lack of fear belies his age and fuels his extraordinary skill set.\n\nWhich is why Jokic was equally complementary of the Timberwolves and optimistic of the Nuggets' chances. After all, they did beat the upstarts twice in the regular season, with Edwards going scoreless in the final quarters of both outings. In other words, all they need to do is perform to potential under pressure. The rest will then follow. Easier said than done? Perhaps. But for as long as there are contests left to play, they -- and especially he -- deserve the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnthony L.

I gave out the UNDER 194.5 in Game 7 of the Orlando Magic vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers series, and it lost when Cleveland beat Orlando 106-94. Magic-Cavaliers trended UNDER heading into the fourth quarter, so my analysis was sound. Nevertheless, I got screwed because they shot a combined 56-for-66 from the foul line.\n\nUnfortunately, that can happen when you're betting NBA totals lower than 200 nowadays. All in all, the 2024 NBA Playoffs have been profitable thus far. Including the play-in tournament, my record is 30-21 for +9.21 units (u) with a +16.3% return on investment. I need to duplicate that performance in the second round to get back to even this NBA season.\n\nThe odds chosen are the best available at the time of writing.\n\nSportsbooks are begging for bettors to take the Over 217. The average total of the three Pacers-Knicks regular-season meetings was 240.5. That fact alone will get people to take the Over Monday. Figuring out the pace is the most important thing for betting totals and I'm predicting the Knicks will turn this series into a rock-fight.\n\nThey played at the slowest pace in the NBA during the regular season. New York can dictate the pace because Indiana isn't aggressive on defense and doesn't force turnovers. Knicks All-Star PG Jalen Brunson is one of the best floor generals in the NBA.\n\nFurthermore, NYK will control the pace in Game 1 because they'll own the boards. During the regular season, New York grabbed 4.6 fewer rebounds per game than its opponents and Indiana hauled in 1.9 fewer rebounds. Also, Indiana shoots worse on the road and Game 1 is in New York.\n\nThe Pacers have a 58.8% effective field goal rate at home, which accounts for 2- and 3-point shooting, and 56.9% on the road. As home favorites in the regular season and playoffs, the Knicks are 14-19 Over/Under (O/U) with a -4.0 margin on the total. Oddly, NYK scores 3.2 more points per game (PPG) on the road but allows 5.8 fewer PPG in Madison Square Garden.\n\nNew York went 2-1 O/U vs. the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1st round of the playoffs. Yet, the Over 204 cashed in Philly's 112-106 Game 5 win because 24 points were scored in overtime. That plus 76ers-Knicks Game 6 going Over the 202.5 total in NYK's 118-115 win might lead to some \"recency bias\" in the market. It's wise in sports betting, and the NBA playoffs, to fade recent results.\n\n_____________________________\n\nNew York forwards OG Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa played with Siakam at the Toronto Raptors earlier this season, so they know his game and tendencies. Achiuwa didn't get much playing time in Round 1. But, Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau should throw him out there because of his familiarity with Siakam.\n\nMore importantly, OG will be Pascal's primary defender and Anunonby is one of the best defensive players in the NBA. OG didn't play in either Pacers-Knicks game after Indiana acquired Siakam and Anunoby went to New York. Achiuwa started those games in OG's absence and Siakam scored 18 and 19 points.\n\nFinally, the Knicks have one of the best interior defenses in the NBA and Pascal isn't a 3-point shooter. In the first round, Siakam shot just 27.3% from behind the arc against the Milwaukee Bucks. He shot 26.7% from three in four games against the Knicks during the regular season and, predictably, Siakam's 3-point shooting rate lowers on the road.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThe Timberwolves jumped out to a series lead with a 106-99 upset Game 1 win at the Denver Nuggets Saturday. T-Wolves All-Star SG Anthony Edwards and Minnesota's defense put on a show. Edwards scored a game-high 43 points on 17-for-29 shooting.\n\nThe Timberwolves forced eventual 2023-24 NBA MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 to turn it over seven times and held Nuggets PG Jamal Murray to just 17 points. Game 1 was Denver's 5th time this season it scored less than 100 points. One of those games was against Minnesota and Murray missed four of them.\n\nMurray is the difference-maker for Denver. If Murray can score 25+ points, the Nuggets are tough to beat. He'll have to do so against the best defensive backcourt in the NBA featuring Edwards and T-Wolves wing Jaden McDaniels. Murray averaged only 17.3 PPG in three meetings with Minnesota in the regular season.\n\nMoreover, the Timberwolves have three bigs to throw at Joki\u0107, including the probable 2023-24 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, C Rudy Gobert, PF Karl-Anthony Towns (KAT), and Sixth Man of the Year, C Naz Reid. Joki\u0107's numbers are almost guaranteed. Yet, if they can hold him to under 50.0% from the field and force turnovers, it's a win for the T-Wolves.\n\nThere's too big of a tax based on the logic \"Edwards won't score 40 again and the Nuggets won't lose Games 1 and 2 at home\". Denver closed Game 1 as -4.5 favorites and it's a full point higher Monday. Edwards has a much easier matchup than Joki\u0107 and Murray.\n\nNuggets PF Aaron Gordon is their best defender and SG Kentavious Caldwell-Pope cannot guard Edwards. That said, Gordon is preoccupied with Towns, making it tougher for Denver to double-team Edwards. Between Ant-Man, KAT, and Minnesota's defense, the Nuggets aren't 5.5 points better than the Timberwolves.\n\n_____________________________\n\nOffensively, McDaniels was awful in Game 1. He scored 0 points on 0-for-7 shooting. But, his offense is gravy because McDaniels is one of the best on-ball defenders in the NBA. Plus, McDaniels has gone from dud to stud in all five postseason games this year. He scored 9 points in Game 1 vs. the Phoenix Suns last round, 25 in Game 2, 5 in Game 3, and 18 in Game 4.\n\nEither way, I'm calling for a bounce-back game for McDaniels. He will probably defend Murray most of the game, so the Timberwolves need him out there. McDaniels played 39 minutes in Game 1. He is a capable 3-point shooter and is the only Minnesota starter who cuts without the ball.

A third MVP will disprove that myth: \"Just put your TV on mute.\"", "body": "The celebrity cameo on the early-morning bus didn't get any less surprising after the first time. In fact, it became even more so, once Christian Braun realized it was a trend and not a one-time occurrence.\n\nOptional shootarounds are only optional for a select few. \"It's always mandatory for the first-, second-, third-year guys,\" Braun said. \"Guys that don't play as much.\" Starters are off the hook if they choose to prioritize rest and recovery. When the Nuggets are on the road, there's often an 8 a.m. bus to the gym for these informal opportunities to get extra shots up.\n\nThis is Braun's second season in the NBA. That bus is for him. It's not for Nikola Jokic.\n\n\"I would say he's probably the most frequent (starter) that's on that bus,\" Braun told The Denver Post. \"And there's other guys that do that too. ... But Nikola, you don't see the MVP of the league on an optional shooting bus at 8 a.m. It surprises you every time because the game before, he probably had a 30-point triple-double.\"\n\nWhy is the center's attendance record so pristine when it doesn't need to be? Jokic doesn't say much on the bus. Maybe, Braun wonders, there's some minutia not discernible to the naked eye that bothers him, that he wants to clean up between games. Maybe he's just imagining a flaw that doesn't actually exist to keep himself motivated.\n\nOr maybe Jokic just relishes having a basketball in his hands. Maybe it's for the love of the game.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets' soft-spoken Serbian center is on the cusp of his third MVP, an enshrinement the NBA typically hands out in early May and that Jokic famously recoils from despite its prestige. He will be the ninth player in league history to win the prize three times.\n\nWhen he was asked about the 2023-24 race against Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander late in the regular season, he sarcastically applauded local reporters for not asking about it sooner. Then he reiterated his past stance: \"I think the whole MVP conversation is getting out of control.\"\n\nDon't mistake that for ambivalence toward his profession as a whole. As Jokic's star has grown the last four seasons, first with MVPs and then a championship, so grew the public perception that he doesn't care much for basketball.\n\nPart of it is his own doing. The notion reached maximum exposure last June. While confetti rained in Ball Arena, a stoic Jokic said to the TV cameras and the world, \"The job is done. We can go home now\" -- only to be informed later that night that he wasn't in the clear quite yet. He groaned upon realizing Denver's parade would keep him in town a few days longer. The networks ran with it.\n\nIt's possible that impression, like the annual MVP debate, has gotten out of hand. Nuggets teammates are adamant it's nonsense. \"Nah, I'm gonna perpetuate that,\" Aaron Gordon said sarcastically. \"He don't give a (crap).\"\n\nOne thing is certain: For a player who sometimes presents himself as indifferent, all other evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n\"If you really want to see Jokic, you want to see how special he is, you want to understand the passion that he has for the game, the joy that he has for the game -- put the TV on mute,\" Reggie Jackson said. \"Just put your TV on mute and watch, and then you'll see.\"\n\nFor a more nuanced grasp of Jokic's relationship to basketball, it helps to understand the fundamental differences between American workaholism and European work-life balance. When Jokic was a rising draft prospect with the Serbian club Mega Vizura, \"I don't think he was watching basketball as much,\" said longtime friend Nenad Miljenovic, who played point guard for Mega. \"I don't think he was, like, a basketball fan.\"\n\nBut he was fascinated by it. Mega's system was particularly friendly toward experimental young players. Jokic wasn't recognized yet as being good enough to play point center, but whenever the ball went through him, he tried moves that startled even his older teammates.\n\n\"He was trying some up-and-unders. Turnarounds and floaters. Not like today, because today it looks so much more automatic, in terms of the move,\" Miljenovic said. \"At that time, he was searching for himself on the court, and it looked very unorthodox. Sometimes he goes through with this zigzag up-and-under against a player that's Euro League level, and you're like, 'Man, we've never seen anybody do that to that player.' Nobody even tried.\"\n\nThe mystery was how Jokic even conjured those tricks without watching large samples of basketball and finding favorite players to steal moves from. \"I think it's just talent,\" Miljenovic said. Jokic was naturally imaginative, without needing a specific example to follow. He didn't need to be a consumer of the sport to be enamored by it.\n\nLike his teammates, he would sometimes stay after practice. He continued his experiments. \"Trying some crazy shots and just having fun with the ball,\" his friend remembers. \"Not really working on the game, but you could see he wanted to be with the ball. You could feel the love, for sure.\"\n\nThe contradiction between Jokic's skill and his physical shortcomings back then is well-documented. After the Nuggets drafted him, he prioritized getting in shape. \"I think his perspective probably changed most when he got to the States,\" Miljenovic said. \"Because up until then, talent was enough.\"\n\nJokic saw basketball as a job in Serbia and realized he needed to adapt to the American ideology about it being a lifestyle once he was exposed to the rigors of the NBA, and the dedication of other star players. Succeeding in the U.S. required not just getting in shape, but staying in shape. It also demanded more studious tendencies. It's almost impossible to be an NBA All-Star, much less an MVP, without being obsessed with the game.\n\nAnd once those accolades begin piling up, being outspoken becomes more weighty. More stressful. Jokic's words gained power and scrutiny over time. He and Miljenovic weren't in close contact for a couple of years, but now they talk frequently. The most common topic of conversation? The NBA.\n\n\"I think sometimes because he's such a staple in worldwide basketball and he's so influential in worldwide basketball, for him to always give his opinion on things -- and English is his second language -- is something where I think he's sometimes reserved,\" Nuggets wing Peyton Watson told The Post. \"Because he'll talk basketball to us. But he's not so outward with what he thinks.\"\n\nYoung players in Denver idolize Jokic -- the mental and physical discipline he's learned to harness. Watson started accompanying him in his postgame weight-lifting routine this season, wanting to get to know Jokic better and learn from him. Gordon, who's as athletic as any individual in the NBA, is in awe of Jokic's conditioning, enough to relent on his sarcastic stance. \"His discipline, his focus, his level of commitment to the game of basketball and to his body is second to none,\" Gordon said. \"I don't think there's anybody that works harder than he does.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm reveals itself in flashes. Back at Nuggets training camp in October, Jokic admitted that he occasionally looks up coaching seminars by prominent Serbian basketball minds, such as Zeljko Obradovic, Dusan Alimpijevic and Igor Kokoskov. \"I think if you want to be good, you need to be a fanatic in basketball,\" he said at the time. During the heat of March Madness, his eyes lit up as he shared admiration for North Carolina State center DJ Burns' bag of left-handed tricks.\n\nThen the moment is gone, and Jokic will return to his usual bored, droll tenor.\n\n\"Nobody goes out there and continually has that much success without caring,\" Watson said. \"I think that it's asinine to think that he's going out there and just doing this by luck. That he woke up and he's the best player in the world. He works more than anybody. It's ridiculous to ever say that he don't touch a ball for the whole summer, and he doesn't care about basketball. He doesn't care about the attention that comes with basketball. He cares about basketball more than anything. He's in America playing basketball for a living. ... This is overseas for him.\"\n\nWhen Braun arrived in Denver as a rookie, his assigned player development coach was the same as Jokic's: Ognjen \"Ogi\" Stojakovic, who is Serbian. Braun was eager to hear Jokic's advice, to follow his lead.\n\nHe had to come to terms with a new sensibility.\n\n\"They teach basketball a little different. They're both Serbian. They practice perfect reps,\" Braun said. \"I think that's why you see that Nikola doesn't really see anybody in front of him. He shoots the ball high every time. And that way, in a game, it doesn't matter who's in front of you. You shoot it high in practice anyway. We never learned that growing up. ... Doesn't matter if it's Rudy Gobert, doesn't matter if it's a 7-footer. Wemby.\n\n\"That's why you see him, every time Wemby can't block it, it's just because it's over the top. He practices the same way every time. He wants perfect reps. They don't do a lot of reps. But they do perfect reps. In the U.S., a lot of it's like, 'Let's shoot 2,000 shots.' And over there, it's like, 'Let's shoot 200 shots, but 200 perfect shots.'\"\n\nQuantity is effective but a little showy, Braun learned. Quality is quieter but more valuable.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_durando@denverpost.com", "name": "Bennett

Mandatory Credit: Jeffrey Swinger-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDenver Nuggets coach Michael Malone is clearly fed up with one of the habits his team appears to have developed during this year's playoffs.\n\nMalone called out his team on Sunday ahead of Game 2, pointing out that their habit of falling behind in the first quarter of games is not sustainable. Denver lost the first quarter in all five of their games against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, then fell behind Minnesota 18-4 to start Game 1 on Saturday before coming back to take the lead.\n\n\"We have to do a better job, our starters in particular, have to do a better job of being ready to play and setting the tone early,\" Malone said, via Dave McMenamin of ESPN. \"What are we waiting for? I mean, now we're down 0-1, what are you waiting for?\n\n\"I talked to our players this morning about how for five games against the Lakers, we were down [virtually] every first quarter. So, do I believe that our guys are fully ready to give whatever it takes to try to defend our title? Of course I do. But at some point, man, you got to stop doing the same thing.\"\n\nMalone is correct that the Nuggets cannot keep doing this. It did not end up costing them against the Lakers, but the Timberwolves are better equipped to take advantage of those slow starts. Even though Denver did come back to take the lead in Game 1, they wound up losing the game.\n\nThe Nuggets are being presented with plenty of issues against Minnesota. An improved performance will be necessary if they want to avoid going down 2-0 and losing both home games to the Timberwolves.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grey_papke@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Grey Papke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivint_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivint Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/michael-malone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-05", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 11}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Like they're running on fumes.\n\nAnd who could blame them? Same thing happened to the Colorado Avalanche at this point last season. After a long and successful playoff run, followed by the shortest offseason in franchise history, they were asked to run it back with a roster that's not as good as it was the season before, when they won it all.\n\nAnd they've gone into a rugged playoff series beat up as well. Sound familiar?\n\nLet's be honest. Denver earned/got a great draw last spring when everything fell into place, including having home court all the way through the playoffs. Those things matter. Lots of championship teams get those kinds of breaks - well earned in most cases - along the way. No shame in having Miami knock out Boston a year ago and setting the Nuggets up for an easier run to the title.\n\nIt's been different this year, starting with an offseason that saw the bench get significantly weaker while the Western Conference got substantially stronger. That has forced Denver's starters to play a lot more highly competitive minutes. Then there was what appears, at the moment at least, to be an ill-advised decision to stand pat at the trade deadline, even when it was clear the bench needed a significant upgrade. The icing on the cake was the meltdown in San Antonio in the second to last game of the regular season, when the Nuggets let a 23-point lead slip away against a last place Spurs team that beat Denver at the buzzer and cost them the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nThat top spot mattered. A lot.\n\nAs a result of all that, the exhausted Nuggets didn't get the easier path this spring. Had they had enough in their tank - and on their bench - to take care of the Spurs, they would have gotten an easier first round matchup against New Orleans, then had to take on the \"Allas\" Mavericks, (who have no idea what the D is supposed to stand for) in Round 2. Instead, they have to deal with a loaded Minnesota team that's built specifically (by the same person, Tim Connelly, who built most of Denver's roster) to beat them.\n\nAll of this is coming home to roost, as they say. And now things look bleak for Nuggets Nation.\n\nCould things still work out for the defending champs? Sure. They could rally and win Game 2, then go back and win one in the Twin Cities and get to come home even while still possessing home court in a potential Game 7. But here on Earth One, everyone can see that the Timberwolves look very much the better team, starting with their first round beat down of the Pelicans and continuing with their impressive Game 1 win at Ball Arena. They are fresher, (much) deeper and can even beat Denver's size and strength inside.\n\nBut the Nuggets have the best player in the world and all that playoff savvy. We'll find out if that's enough.\n\nChances are really good that it won't be.\n\nIt's more likely that Denver will get a longer offseason to try to rest up, regroup, and hopefully restock their roster. Simply put, standing pat - again - with the roster as is would be a terrible mistake. The vaunted Nuggets core is still in its collective prime, but the self-anointed \"best starting five in the NBA\" still needs help to return to the top of the mountain. Counting on Peyton Watson or Christian Braun to suddenly develop into a \"Sixth-man of the Year\" candidate is fallacy. Not going to happen. The Nuggets collection of young players are talented, but far from ready for prime time, as we can all see.\n\nDenver needs veteran help off the bench. Someone who can perhaps, you know, shoot?\n\nConnelly's replacement at the top of the Nuggets front office pyramid, Calvin Booth, has done a very good job to this point. He made the key acquisition of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope before last season. By all accounts, he's drafted well, too. But the spotlight will soon shift, and begin to shine directly on him. Booth will need to do something even more significant during the coming offseason. He has to address Denver's glaring deficiencies off the bench so that the championship window can remain open for the talented Denver core. The Nuggets have to be aggressive in the draft, free agency and via the trade route. Using some of their young unproven talent as a trade chip should not be off the table.\n\nOtherwise, the team built by Booth's predecessor may slam the Nuggets title window shut permanently.", "source": {"uri": "milehighsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mile High Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_knudson@milehighsports.com", "name": "Mark Knudson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Connelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Connelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Braun_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Braun (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Booth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Booth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://milehighsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23191413.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

He's seen that can do it here. He knows he can do it here now. That's where the satisfaction is.\"\n\nThis is where the road to \"more\" hardens: Denver hosts Minnesota Saturday night in Game 1 of the kind of 50-50 series that determines if the Nuggets were a one-hit wonder or built for more. It's the kind of series a dynasty wins.\n\nIt's also a family feud and passing the torch in the Western Conference.\n\nThe family feud would be more of a jab-filled roast between Booth and Tim Connelly, the president of basketball operations for the Timberwolves, whose lot is forever linked to the Nuggets' first championship and basketball sea change that came with it.\n\n\"Cal's a superstar,\" Connelly said in 2017 on the day he hired Booth into Denver's front office.\n\nAnd the passing of the torch?\n\nThe NBA superteam is dead. RIP. The Nuggets and Timberwolves helped end it. For the first time in 19 years, LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant were bounced from the playoffs before May. Barging into their place are Nikola Jokic, Anthony Edwards and Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, among others.\n\nAnd doesn't it seem this next wave of hoopers would rather sweep you out of the postseason than convince you to join their team?\n\nThe Nuggets remain close with Connelly, who helped set the table for what Booth finished.\n\n\"I don't like that guy (Connelly),\" Jamal Murray tells me, adding with a smile, \"Great guy, great dude. Always puts a smile on my face -- all of our faces. He's a guy that we built a relationship with off the court. But for right now I don't like him. I don't like him at all.\"\n\nJokic praised Minnesota's acquisition of center Rudy Gobert, a move derided at the time.\n\n\"When Tim Connelly made that trade everybody was laughing at him and what he was doing,\" Jokic said Friday. \"But he made a great team. I think he deserves credit for doing that.\"\n\nBooth and Connelly -- the men running two powerhouses with no semblance of ego -- still talk and text weekly.

Connelly was the assistant video coordinator with the Wizards.\n\n\"I remember Tim was always buried way in the back of the video room,\" Booth laughs.\n\nMaybe Booth and Connelly would've risen to this point without the other. Maybe not.\n\n\"Tim was a mentor, somebody that helped me get to where I am. Now we're competing,\" Booth says. \"Outside of this series, we're guys that have been lifelong friends, at least as adults in basketball. I'll always have a great appreciation for all the stuff he did for me.\"\n\nNBA things change, but this series looks like a playoff preview for the next half-dozen years.\n\nFor the Nuggets, Booth's brain can make it so.\n\nWith Jokic, Murray and Michael Porter Jr. due for a combined $123.3 million next season alone, Booth's post-championship challenge was getting younger -- and cheaper.\n\n\"I think we've accepted the fact that if you're going to be that top-heavy there's going to be some concessions elsewhere,\" Booth says. \"I think we have one of the best and most expensive starting lineups. But they still play above their value even though their monetary number is way up there. That allows us to have a younger bench and bring guys along.\"\n\nDenver's model with Jokic is San Antonio with Tim Duncan.\n\n\"When I was with Seattle,\" Booth says, his Sonics faced the Spurs in a playoff series. Spurs icon Tony Parker, the No. 28 overall draft pick, was the starting point guard as a rookie.\n\n\"San Antonio, they always took chances with getting young guys out there and getting them experience. After a while, you benefit from that,\" Booth says. \"Credit to Coach (Michael) Malone and Josh (Kroenke) and Tim, (because) they did that with Joker and Jamal early on. They gave them that runway and allowed them to play through some hard times.\"\n\nHe adds, \"You had to go through those difficult periods of time to get where we are right now.\"\n\nWith full knowledge of 50 years of Nuggets heartbreak, I still argue winning Denver's first title was the easy part. The hard part will be doing it a second time -- with the likes of Minnesota and Oklahoma City having witnessed Denver do it where it's not supposed to be done.\n\nAll the sudden, the Nuggets are not the youthful up-and-comers. Edwards, the Minnesota star, is 22. Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City star, is 25. Luka Doncic, the Dallas star, is 25.\n\nJokic (29), Murray (27), Porter (25) and Aaron Gordon (28) wear the target.\n\nColorado prays Jokic follows Denver greats John Elway and Joe Sakic as a one-team man.\n\n\"I think he (Jokic) is comfortable here. He enjoys his teammates. He enjoys the city,\" Booth says. \"I think as long as he's having fun playing the game, because he plays with such passion and enjoyment, I feel pretty good about him being in a Nuggets jersey.\"\n\nNuggets fans should feel splendid with Booth in charge, even if he'll be the last to say so.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"},

Touted as one of the toughest players to beat, there have been major contributors in his journey so far. Without a doubt, Micah Nori is one of them. However, after Jokic was drafted, coach Nori stated, \"I didn't even know his name then\", maybe because they had the likes of Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic and couldn't find a spot for the Serbian in the squad. Now, the 50-year-old has some issues with the Joker as he believes he doesn't get enough credit for shaping the athlete.\n\nDuring a recent conversation on 'SiriusXM', the former assistant coach for the Nuggets said that he is still waiting to be acknowledged by Jokic for everything he did for him in the initial years of his NBA career. Nori claimed that Jokic didn't take professional decisions to heart, and, now, they share a good relationship.\n\nHowever, the Wolves assistant coach unveiled that the Nuggets star still hilariously takes a dig at him at every opportunity, \"He kids with me all the time. To this day, he still sends me gifs of Forrest Gump running across country because he says that's what he did that Summer League.\" Even though it's all fun and games between them, it doesn't mean that Nori isn't looking for the credit.\n\nHe added,\n\n\"I told him that it was a motivational tactic to make him the player that he is today, and I would just appreciate if he'd just say thank you. He's got three MVPs and he's yet to mention my name in any acceptance speech.\"\n\nIn all probability, Jokic is about to bag his third league MVP title. This could be the perfect time to include Micah Nori's name in his acceptance speech. For now, the Wolves are the next hurdle in the Nuggets' run.\n\nThe defending champions have been brilliant yet again throughout the season and after blowing out the Lakers in the first round, their confidence must be at an all-time high facing Nori' Wolves. His numbers against the Wolves have been impressive and fans would expect him to bring the same energy again.\n\nThe 29-year-old has a career average of 21.9 points, 10.7 rebounds and 6.5 assists with a 53.9 FG% against the Wolves. He has only faced the Minnesota franchise once in the postseason in 2023, with 27.2 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 9.0 assists.\n\nBesides numbers, Jokic has pulled off miracles on the court because of his brilliant game knowledge. Several league stars would co-sign on that. After getting swept by the Nuggets in 2023, LeBron James heaped praise on the Joker for his ability to read the opposition in time and instruct his teammates on how to break their plans, \"He sees plays before they happen.\" Naturally, he will need all his skills if the defending champs aim to take down his former coach's team, who are hot right now.\n\nUndoubtedly, Jokic is almost an anomaly in the way he approaches his game and despite ruling the league at the moment, he likes to stay out of the limelight. For a guy who still trolls Nori with a Forrest Gump reference, the stats and his humility show that Jokic has come a long way.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jusuf_Nurki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jusuf Nurki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forrest Gump (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/b1bc148a-untitled-design-2024-05-06t014613.374.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Aaron Gordon recently took it up a notch by drawing parallels between his Denver Nuggets teammate and the great Larry Bird. The 28-year-old even called the Serbian a cheat code while shedding light on his impact in deciding the outcome of the games.\n\nDuring Gordon's latest appearance on SiriusXM NBA Radio, he outlined that the Nuggets players always remained aware of the position of their teammates. In the process, he highlighted how Jokic had perfected this craft, forcing the opposition to be drawn towards him. This opened up scoring opportunities for the rest of the roster while the talisman manipulated the opponent's defense at his will.\n\nGordon believed this gameplay had similarities with Bird's endeavors for the Boston Celtics in the 1980s. Comparing these two icons, he mentioned, \"He [Nikola Jokic] is like 7ft 1'', 7ft 2'' Larry Bird. He is Larry but taller, bigger, and stronger. He is a cheat code for sure\".\n\nAmidst the high praise, the comparison carried a certain volume. During his prime years, Bird made basketball look like an effortless sport. From scoring at his whim to uniquely facilitating for his teammates. At times, Larry Legend could seemingly do whatever he wanted on the court. Interestingly, modern-day NBA fans carry a similar perception of Jokic, validating the comparison between them.\n\nAs a result, this was not the first time these two talismanic figures were put into the same bracket. Several had done so previously, prompting the supporters to thoroughly consider the comparison.\n\nFollowing his emergence in recent years, many analysts have compared Jokic to Bird. However, George Karl, the former head coach of the Nuggets, took matters a step further by incorporating various such greats in the discussion. A few days back, he wrote on X (formerly Twitter), \"He has some Bird in his game, some Magic [Johnson], some [Tim] Duncan, and a lot a Sabonis. But really he's 1 of 1. And maybe a GOAT one day\".\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding the debate, Bird admitted that he held Jokic in high regard. Expressing his admiration for the 2x MVP, he once mentioned, \"I would love to play against him. He's good. There are so many great centers over the history of our game, man, is he good. I just hope he stays healthy and be able to continue to do what he does because he is fun to watch\".\n\nSo, such comparisons may surface time and again in the future, prompting the fans to engage in debates and discussions. However, all these only point toward one ulterior point. Undoubtedly, the international star remains on track to be one of the greatest players to ever play in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sourav_bose@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Sourav Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/67909ed6-untitled-design-2024-05-05t103139.044.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537977", "eventUri": "eng-9537977", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 98, "relevance": 1}

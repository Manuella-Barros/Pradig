His case was sent to Liverpool Crown Court for sentence on August 29.\n\nREAD MORE: Army should be deployed to end UK riots, says expert - but there'd be a catch\n\nClick for more of the latest news from across the world from the Daily Star.\n\nBefore the proceedings started, the court heard from Wharton's solicitor Isaac Mirza who said the defendant had been \"attacked in the cells\" prior to appearing. Mr Mirza said the defendant had \"a bloodied nose and an injury to his eye.\"\n\nWharton's charge comes in relation to the violent disorder in Liverpool and around the country over the weekend. A planned protest at the Pier Head on Saturday afternoon turned violent, with Merseyside Police forced to use riot gear after people were seen throwing bricks and debris at officers.\n\nScenes later spilled onto County Road in Walton, with rioters causing major damage in what police described as \"serious violent disorder\". Chaos, violence and destruction followed as looters targeted businesses, bins were used to start fires and the Spellow Library and Community Hub was set alight, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Sanderson-Kirk described the chaos to the court, saying: \"Officers were dealing with large scale violent disorder. Officers dealt with arson, throwing bricks and glass. A police helicopter observed a male entering Spellow Hub Library, which had previously been burnt out and looted.\"\n\nHe revealed that one man was nabbed inside the library with a computer monitor and continued: \"Outside, the police found this defendant. He was wearing a balaclava and appeared to be profusely sweating. The crown says this defendant was acting as a lookout.\"\n\nThe prosecutor informed the court that the offence has a starting point of one year behind bars. It emerged that Wharton has a rap sheet with 16 previous convictions for 26 offences, including robbery and burglary.\n\nDefence solicitor Mr Mirza confirmed there would be no plea for bail. When the defendant asked, \"Am I allowed to speak? \" District Judge Timothy Boswell instructed Mr Mirza to have a word with his client before addressing him directly.\n\nHe told the defendant: \"Mr Wharton, I am committing your case for sentence to the crown court. It will be up to the crown court to decide what the right sentence is.\"\n\nAfter a question about getting a pre-sentence report sorted, the defendant quipped \"nice one lad\" as he was escorted to the cells.\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_williams@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Kelly Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "patrick_edrich@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Patrick Edrich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "adam_everett@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Adam Everett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walton,_Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walton, Liverpool"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Wharton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Wharton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II_Law_Courts,_Liverpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Elizabeth II Law Courts, Liverpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balaclava (clothing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Head", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pier Head"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Star_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Star (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33400507.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Adam-WhartonJPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791584", "eventUri": "eng-9791584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 239}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 510, "textEnd": 519}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Adam Wharton appeared before Liverpool Magistrates' Court this morning, Monday, August 5 where he pleaded guilty to burglary in relation to the serious disorder on Saturday night.\n\nWharton, who wore a prison issue tracksuit in the dock, was caught inside Spellow Library and Community Hub after it was set alight by violent rioters. The 28-year-old, of Selwyn Street in Walton, said \"nice one lad\" as he learnt he would be returned to the city's crown court for sentence on August 29.\n\nHowever, Wharton is no stranger to the city's courts and has appeared before a number of judges for various burglary-related offences. The ECHO previously reported how Wharton broke into the home of a pensioner on Christmas Day in 2015 along with two co-conspirators.\n\nBizarrely his partners in crime - William Read and Gary Scott - thought it would be a good idea to scrawl their first names on the walls and doors of the house. The three men targeted the \"vulnerable\" pensioner's and stole two TVs, cash and jewellery, including a pendant with \"personal sentimental value\".\n\nWhen the case got to court in March 2017, Wharton pleaded guilty to burglary and admitted stealing the pendant after climbing in through a broken window. By the time he appeared in court, Wharton had already been sentenced to six months for other offences and had been on remand for nine months since the end of that term. He was locked up for 20 months in relation to his involvement targeting the pensioner.\n\nThe ECHO covered Wharton appearing back at crown court in March 2021 after he, along with a fellow bungling burglar, targeted a young family's home which was being renovated for a disabled child. The court heard Wharton had been robbing and stealing from victims since he was just 15, and in September of the previous year had teamed up with career crook Paul Warburton for another despicable burglary.\n\nThe pair struck the family home in Harley Street, Orrell Park, breaking a window to gain entry. Although the family wasn't in, a neighbour rang the police. When officers arrived they found one window damaged and another smashed and forced open. An officer who attended with a police dog was called to the scene and shouted into the property, ordering anyone inside to move to the kitchen.\n\nBoth crooks came down stairs and were arrested. The pair claimed to the police they had \"simply been there to sleep\". When interviewed by police Wharton gave a prepared statement, in which he denied the burglary and said he was only there \"to get his head down for the night\".\n\nHe denied moving or bagging up any property and then wouldn't answer any questions. However, he later pleaded guilty to burglary at a hearing. His defence told the court he was remorseful for his involvement and since being in prison on remand had been unable to assist his sick mum. He also said he had been unable to see his newborn daughter.\n\nWharton's defence said he had autism and ADHD and was on medication for schizophrenia. Judge Stuart Driver KC accepted Wharton had mental health difficulties but jailed him for two-and-a-half years.\n\nWharton did not come to the attention of the courts again until this morning. His most recent offence comes in relation to the violent disorder seen in Liverpool and around the country over the weekend. A planned protest at the Pier Head on Saturday afternoon turned violent, with Merseyside Police forced to use riot gear after people were seen throwing bricks and debris at officers.\n\nScenes later spilled onto County Road in Walton, with rioters causing major damage in what police described as \"serious violent disorder\". Chaos, violence and destruction followed as looters targeted businesses, bins were used to start fires and the Spellow Library & Community Hub was set alight.\n\nLiverpool Magistrates' Court heard from prosecutor Joshua Sanderson-Kirk this morning who said: \"Officers were dealing with large scale violent disorder. Officers dealt with arson, throwing bricks and glass. A police helicopter observed a male entering Spellow Hub Library, which had previously been burnt out and looted.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said one man was found inside the library carrying a computer monitor. He added: \"Outside, the police found this defendant. He was wearing a balaclava and appeared to be profusely sweating. The crown says this defendant was acting as a lookout.\"\n\nMr Sanderson-Kirk told the court the offence carries a starting point of one year with a range of a community order to two years in prison. The court hears that Wharton has 16 previous convictions for 26 offences, including robbery and burglary.\n\nHis solicitor Isaac Mirza said there would be no application for bail. His defence added Wharton had been \"attacked in the cells\" prior to appearing in court.\n\nDistrict Judge Timothy Boswell said: \"Mr Wharton, I am committing your case for sentence to the crown court. It will be up to the crown court to decide what the right sentence is.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_everett@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Adam Everett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Wharton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Wharton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellow_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spellow railway station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Wharton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Wharton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walton,_Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walton, Liverpool"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remand (court procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrell_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orrell Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harley Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boswell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Boswell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Head", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pier Head"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balaclava (clothing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29678983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_NDR_LEC_240321wharton02jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791584", "eventUri": "eng-9791584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 395, "textEnd": 403}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 789, "textEnd": 798}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-03-", "textStart": 1408, "textEnd": 1418}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Here are the details of some of their court appearances today.\n\nPeople arrested in connection with riots across the country last week have appeared in court.\n\nThe riots began in Southport last Tuesday - a day after three girls were killed in a knife attack in the Merseyside town.\n\nThe demonstrations - whipped up by far-right agitators sharing misinformation about the suspect online - spread to cities and towns including Manchester, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Rotherham and Bolton.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested across the country. Here are the details of some of those who have appeared in court accused of taking part in the riots.\n\nA 14-year-old boy - Liverpool\n\nThe youngest of those to appear in court was a 14-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons due to his age.\n\nHe said he understood how \"foolish and silly\" he had been after pleading guilty to violent disorder over the rioting in Liverpool city centre, a court heard.\n\nLiverpool Magistrates' Court heard the teenager, from Liverpool, was part of a group of eight to 12 males who were lighting fireworks and setting them off in the direction of members of the public and police officers near a branch of B&M in Clayton Square that had already been looted on Saturday night.\n\nUK riots latest: Army of specialist officers to target disorder\n\nThe teenager was caught on CCTV footage with a firework in his hand but when arrested told officers: \"I'm sorry, I wasn't firing them at you\".\n\nThe court heard he had no previous convictions and had never been in trouble with the police before.\n\nHis lawyer Iqbal Singh Kang said the incident was \"completely out of character for him and his family\". The boy's father and uncle were in court.\n\nHe said the youngster went to the city centre to catch a bus and amid the \"widescale disorder across the city became involved with people he didn't know who were offering out various fireworks\".\n\nMr Kang said the teenager was held in police custody for two days, adding: \"Now he's thought it through properly he understands how foolish and silly he has been and wishes he could turn the clock back.\"\n\nThe teenager was granted bail, with a condition he does not enter Liverpool city centre, ahead of sentencing on 27 August.\n\nWilliam Nelson Morgan - Liverpool\n\nA 69-year-old welder, the oldest to appear in court so far, has admitted his role in Saturday's riots in Liverpool, where he came armed with a wooden bat.\n\nWilliam Nelson Morgan, from Walton, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe court heard around 100 people set fire to bins, damaged local businesses, and set fire to other buildings in County Road, Walton, on Saturday night.\n\nMorgan, who had no previous convictions, was said to be part of a crowd involved in throwing bricks and had a wooden bat or cosh with him.\n\nDistrict Judge Timothy Boswell remanded him in custody ahead of sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court on 29 August.\n\nDerek Drummond - Liverpool\n\nDerek Drummond, 58, admitted punching a police officer in the face during a riot in Southport. Members of his family wept as he appeared in court.\n\nThe Southport resident pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assault during last Tuesday's violence in the Merseyside town.\n\nThe prosecutor told Liverpool Magistrates' Court the officer was trying to protect his colleagues as they put their riot gear on, when Drummond called them \"shithouses\" and punched the officer in the face.\n\nBody-worn video footage captured the incident, which left the officer with cuts and bruises, while Drummond was struck with a baton.\n\nThe prosecutor said he was part of the group that began throwing bricks, having broken down a garden wall, although the court heard he denied throwing bricks himself.\n\nDrummond was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court on 29 August.\n\nAs he left the dock, he spoke to two female family members, who were in tears throughout the hearing.\n\nAdam Wharton and Ellis Wharton - Liverpool\n\nTwo brothers appeared at Liverpool magistrates' court accused of crimes relating to a library which was set on fire during the riots.\n\n28-year-old Adam Wharton appeared first, admitting burglary with intent to steal from the Spellow Lane Library Hub, which suffered severe damage to the ground floor due to the fire.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nPM warns anyone whipping up online violence will face justice\n\nExplainer: Why are people rioting across the UK?\n\nThe library was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country.\n\nWharton, who has 16 previous convictions for 26 offences, including robbery and burglary, stood in the dock at Liverpool Magistrates' Court wearing a grey, prison-issue tracksuit.\n\nAs he left the dock, Wharton said: \"Nice one, shitty arse judge man.\"\n\nHis younger brother Ellis Wharton, 22, admitted trying to steal a computer screen from the library - but denied assaulting a police officer.\n\nMerseyside Police said about 300 people were involved in violent disorder on County Road, Walton, on Saturday night, which included community facilities being set on fire.\n\nDistrict Judge Timothy Boswell remanded both in custody ahead of their

Violence has flared up in Southport, Liverpool city centre and Walton over the past week.\n\nPolice vans were set alight and officers were attacked during protesting on St Luke's Road in the seaside town on Tuesday last week, which came following the fatal stabbings of six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar. A planned protest at the Pier Head on Saturday afternoon then turned violent, with Merseyside Police forced to use riot gear after bricks and debris were thrown towards PCs.\n\nThe disorder then continued on County Road that evening as chaos, violence and destruction ensued as looters targeted businesses in the area. This included a fire being started at Spellow Library and Community Hub.\n\nThree of the 12 defendants who appeared before Liverpool Magistrates' Court today, Monday, were charged with violent disorder in relation to events in Southport. Derek Drummond, of Pool Street in the town, pleaded guilty to this charge and an additional count of assaulting an emergency services worker.\n\nThe 58-year-old's supporters wept as Joshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, described how around 300 people were seen \"marching towards a mosque\" on St Luke's Road shouting \"this is our f***ing country\", \"scumbag b*****ds\", \"England till I die\" and \"lets get them\", as well as chanting \"who the f*** is Allah?\". The defendant then shouted \"s***houses\" before punching one police officer, PC Thomas Ball, in the face.\n\nDrummond was said to have subsequently thrown bricks at the scene after \"breaking down a wall\", although this was not accepted by his solicitor Jack Sweeney. He will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on August 29 and was remanded into custody until this date, turning to two women in the public gallery and saying \"love you\" as he was led down to the cells.\n\nGareth Metcalfe, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, did not indicate a plea to the charge of violent disorder. The 44-year-old was remanded into custody ahead of an appearance before the crown court on the same date.\n\nJohn O'Malley, also of Cambridge Gardens, however pleaded guilty to this charge. The 43-year-old - who claims that \"his involvement was standing in a group of people shouting and gesticulating, but not throwing objects, damaging property or assaulting anyone\" - will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on August 29, being remanded into custody until this date.\n\nThree men and a youth meanwhile appeared before District Judge Timothy Boswell in relation to the disturbances in the city centre. A 14-year-old boy from South Liverpool, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to violent disorder.\n\nMr Sanderson-Kirk told the court that this related to the teenager throwing fireworks at a police van near to B&M on Clayton Square, a store which had earlier been \"looted\". He was found with five fireworks and a lighter following his arrest and told officers: \"I'm sorry, I wasn't firing them at you though.\"\n\nHis solicitor Iqbal Kang told the judge: \"He has no prior convictions whatsoever, he has never been in trouble with the police before. It is completely out of character for him.\n\n\"He tells me he headed into the city centre with the intention of catching a bus home. He was on his own. It seems, perhaps through inexperience and lack of maturity, he became involved with people he did not know who were offering out fireworks.\n\n\"He says he does not know why he became involved, but did not think things through. He did not head into the city centre with the intention of causing any kind of disturbance.\n\n\"He has had plenty of time to think about his actions. He has spent two nights in custody. He understands how foolish and silly he has been and wishes he could turn the clock back.\n\n\"It is completely out of the blue. One could positively say if he had not been heading into the city centre to catch a bus, we would not be convened here like this.\"\n\nThe boy will be sentenced at the youth court on August 27. He was released on bail until this date under conditions not to enter the L1, L2 or L3 postcode areas.\n\nJimmy Bailey, of Station Avenue in Ellesmere Port, was meanwhile charged with committing violent disorder on Paradise. The 45-year-old pleaded not guilty, and was remanded into custody ahead of an appearance in the crown court on August 30.\n\nDeclan Geiran, who attempted to set a Merseyside Police van on fire on William Brown Street, pleaded guilty to arson and violent disorder. The 29-year-old, of Kelso Road in Kensington, was seen on CCTV \"using an implement to attempt to set fire to the vehicle before making off\", later being arrested in possession of two lighters.\n\nHe has a total of 13 previous convictions for 18 offences, including breaching a community order and a malicious communications offence. Geiran was remanded into custody ahead of his sentencing before the crown court on August 30.\n\nLloyd Killner, of Burton Road in Lincoln, meanwhile denied a count of violent disorder on Stanley Street and Victoria Street. The 35-year-old, who was remanded into custody ahead of an appearance before Liverpool Crown Court on August 30, said from the dock: \"No, not guilty. I was on my own.\"\n\nLiam Riley, of Walton Road, admitted violent disorder and racially-aggravated threatening behaviour. The 41-year-old was said to have formed part of a \"large crowd\" of around 100 people - some of whom were \"throwing rocks and bricks towards\" police officers on Whitechapel, where a number of shop windows were also smashed.\n\nMr Sanderson-Kirk outlined how \"the rest of the crowd began to run, but the defendant stood his ground, shouting and waving his arms\". After being taken to the ground, a \"very drunk\" Riley continued to shout at PCs by calling them \"traitors\" and \"Muslim lovers\".\n\nHe was also found in possession of a banner reading \"this is our city\" following his arrest, having been wearing a St George's flag. Under interview, he \"said he'd heard through word of mouth\" of a protest at the Pier Head and attended \"in sympathy\" and had \"been to the pub and had three or four pints at Ranelagh's Tavern\", but \"accepted he did get involved.\"\n\nThree men were also in the dock in relation to the violence in Walton. Brothers Adam and Ellis Wharton, of Selwyn Street in Kirkdale, admitted burglary with intent to steal at Spellow Library.\n\nThe former, aged 28, apparently acted as a \"lookout\" while his 22-year-old sibling entered the \"burnt out and looted\" building and stole a computer monitor. The latter however denied a further count of assaulting emergency services worker PC Thomas Nielsen, being remanded into custody ahead of an appearance in the crown court on August 29.\n\nAdam Wharton, who was apprehended wearing a balaclava and \"profusely sweating\", has a total of 16 previous convictions for 26 offences including robbery and burglary. He was heard to say \"nice one lad\" as he was led to the cells, having been remanded into custody ahead of his sentencing on the same date.\n\nWilliam Morgan, of Linton Street in Walton, admitted violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. The 69-year-old, who was armed with a wooden bat, was said to have thrown bricks towards officers at the scene before attempting to resist arrest.\n\nHe as no previous convictions. Morgan will be sentenced in the crown court on August 29, and was remanded into custody until this date.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"},

It comes after 11 people appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Monday charged with similar offences.\n\nA 15-year-old boy, from Toxteth, has been charged with violent disorder in Liverpool city centre on Saturday, August 3. He cannot be named for legal reasons. Dylan Carey, 26, of Castle Hill Road in Hindley in Greater Manchester has also been charged with violent disorder. This was in connection with the scenes on St Luke's Road in Southport on Tuesday, July 30. They will both appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court today, Tuesday, August 6.\n\nThe first series of incidents happened on Tuesday, July 30 on St Luke's Road in Southport. Police vans were set alight and officers attacked. A large group of people, many of whom police said were believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, began to throw items towards a local mosque. Cars were also set on fire and bricks were thrown at police.\n\nA planned protest at the Pier Head on Saturday, August 3 was also followed by violence. Merseyside Police were forced to use riot gear after people were seen throwing bricks and debris at officers.\n\nScenes later spilled onto County Road in Walton, with rioters causing major damage in what police described as \"serious violent disorder\".

Liam Riley, 41 and of Walton Road, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court this afternoon, Monday, August 5 after he was charged with violent disorder in relation to events in the city centre on Saturday afternoon.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Sanderson-Kirk told the court that Riley formed part of a \"large crowd\" of around 100 people, some of whom were \"throwing rocks and bricks\" towards police officers on Whitechapel, where a number of shop windows were also smashed. The prosecutor added: \"The rest of the crowd began to run but the defendant stood his ground, shouting and waving his arms.\"\n\nRiley was taken to the ground by officers, but continued to shout calling them \"traitors\" and \"Muslim lovers\". The court heard the defendant \"appeared very drunk to officers\".\n\nThe defendant was found in possession of a banner reading \"this is our city\" following his arrest. Under interview, he \"said he'd heard through word of mouth\" of a protest at the Pier Head and attended \"in sympathy\".\n\nRiley was said to have been wearing a St George's flag and \"said he'd been to the pub and had three or four pints\", but \"accepted he did get involved\". Riley, who was brought into the dock wearing a grey jumper and with a shaved head, spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth before he pleaded guilty to the violent disorder charge, as well as a count of racially-aggravated threatening behaviour towards a police officer.\n\nRiley's offending comes in relation to the violent disorder in Liverpool and around the country over the weekend. A planned protest at the Pier Head on Saturday afternoon turned violent, with Merseyside Police forced to use riot gear after people were seen throwing bricks and debris at officers.\n\nScenes later spilled onto County Road in Walton, with rioters causing major damage in what police described as \"serious violent disorder\". Chaos, violence and destruction followed as looters targeted businesses, bins were used to start fires and the Spellow Library & Community Hub was set alight.\n\nMark Dallas, defending, said there would be no application for bail and added his client has no previous convictions.

Liam Riley, Derek Drummond and Declan Geiran had previously been due to learn their fates later this month, but their sentencings have now been brought forward.\n\nDrummond, of Pool Street in Southport, admitted violent disorder and assaulting an emergency services worker at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Monday. The 58-year-old's supporters wept as Joshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, described how around 300 people were seen \"marching towards a mosque\" on St Luke's Road shouting \"this is our f***ing country\", \"scumbag b*****ds\", \"England till I die\" and \"lets get them\", as well as chanting \"who the f*** is Allah?\".\n\nThe defendant then shouted \"s***houses\" before punching one police officer, PC Thomas Ball, in the face. Drummond was said to have subsequently thrown bricks at the scene after \"breaking down a wall\", although this was not accepted by his solicitor Jack Sweeney. He turned to two women in the public gallery and said \"love you\" as he was led down to the cells, having been remanded into custody.\n\nGeiran, who attempted to set a Merseyside Police van on fire on William Brown Street in the city centre on Saturday, pleaded guilty to arson and violent disorder. The 29-year-old, of Kelso Road in Kensington, was seen on CCTV \"using an implement to attempt to set fire to the vehicle before making off\", later being arrested in possession of two lighters. He has a total of 13 previous convictions for 18 offences, including breaching a community order and a malicious communications offence.\n\nRiley, of Walton Road, admitted violent disorder and racially-aggravated threatening behaviour. The 41-year-old was said to have formed part of a \"large crowd\" of around 100 people - some of whom were \"throwing rocks and bricks towards\" police officers on Whitechapel, where a number of shop windows were also smashed.\n\nMr Sanderson-Kirk outlined how \"the rest of the crowd began to run, but the defendant stood his ground, shouting and waving his arms\". After being taken to the ground, a \"very drunk\" Riley continued to shout at PCs by calling them \"traitors\" and \"Muslim lovers\".\n\nHe was also found in possession of a banner reading \"this is our city\" following his arrest, having been wearing a St George's flag. Under interview, he \"said he'd heard through word of mouth\" of a protest at the Pier Head and attended \"in sympathy\" and had \"been to the pub and had three or four pints at Ranelagh's Tavern\", but \"accepted he did get involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_everett@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Adam

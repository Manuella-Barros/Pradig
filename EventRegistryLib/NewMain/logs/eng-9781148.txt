And it wasn't until Matt LeBlanc gave her a game-changing piece of advice that she was finally able to relax.\n\nThe Friends star continued, \"The things she said were so outrageously illogical that in order for me to justify them, you know, I felt like, 'oof.' It just took a lot of work to figure out, 'All right, how is it possible that I think this is true or a good idea or a reasonable thing to say?'\"\n\n\"It's like a puzzle,\" Ted Danson said, and Kudrow agreed.\n\n\"Yeah, to make it look real,\" she said. \"And so I think it's second season or third season and I'm doing it and I'm like, 'Something's wrong.' Because I'm not doing the work I was doing. I'm slacking off. I'm being lazy and I was getting really mad at myself.\"\n\nLuckily, her co-star LeBlanc, who played Joey Tribbiani, was there to snap her out of it.

I'm not doing the work I did for Phoebe, so it can't be good,' and he went, \"No, you know who the character is now. You don't need to do the work you did. You got it,' and I went, 'What?

I wasn't literally getting hysterical -- you know, like if you're getting hysterical, someone slaps you back. Like, 'Oh thanks. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I needed, yeah.'\"\n\nDanson could relate to the experience, as he himself didn't feel like he was pulling off his Cheers role as Sam Malone until Season 2.\n\n\"I didn't know how to play Sam Malone until about a year and a half in,\" he told her. \"Because I did not know what arrogance meant. I had never been to a bar. I did not pick women up. I was not a womanizer. Maybe I wanted to be, but I wasn't.\"\n\nThe key to getting over it for Danson was his realization that he couldn't please everyone.\n\n\"It was only after about getting the feedback after a year and a half and realizing, 'Oh, half the people like me, half the people hate me, so what the fuck? I'm gonna do this for myself,\" Danson said. \"'I don't care what you think.

She is someone who doesn't know the concept of sugarcoating, she is plain, simple yet outrageously illogical. Although brutal, all you get from her is an honest opinion, which without a doubt comes from a genuine place of love. Playing such a role wasn't an easy task for Lisa Kudrow and she admitted it on Siruis XM's Where Everybody Knows Your Name podcast on July 31.\n\nThe Friends alum, 61, noted it took her maybe over two seasons to completely understand her character, majorly because it was \"a lot of work\" to figure Phoebe's unabashed shades. In between the second and third season, Kudrow sensed something was off with her. The negative spiral prompted the veteran to doubt her acting and believe she was \"slacking off\" or \"being lazy.\"\n\nHer anxiety reached Matt LeBlanc who played another fan-favorite role of Joey Tribbiani. He helped her relax with his reassuring advice, \"(Kudrow) You know who the character is now. You don't need to do the work you did (after two seasons). You got it.\" The positive encouragement from her co-star was \"enough\" for Kudrow.\n\n\"It's sort of like someone shook me 'cause I was getting hysterical. I wasn't literally getting hysterical, but you know like if you're getting hysterical, someone slaps you back. You're like, 'Oh, thanks.

It just took a lot of work to figure out,\" she said.\n\nThe Better Nate Than Ever star revealed how she thought she was being \"lazy\" by the time the second year came around and said she was extremely grateful to her co-star, Matt LeBlanc, and his wise words.\n\nShe added: \"I'm slacking off. I'm being lazy and I was getting really mad at myself, and LeBlanc came. He said, 'What's going on with you?' I said, 'I'm being lazy. I'm not doing the work that I did first season, second season. I'm not doing the work I did for Phoebe, so it can't be good.\n\n\"And he went, 'No, you know who the character is now. You don't need to do the work you did. You got it,\" and I went, 'What? Oh'.\n\n\"That was enough,\" she said.\n\n\"It's sort of like someone shook me 'cause I was getting hysterical. I wasn't literally getting hysterical, but you know like if you're getting hysterical, someone slaps you back. You're like, 'Oh, thanks. That's what I needed.\"\n\nFor more TV news, click here", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoebe Buffay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Kudrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courteney_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courteney Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schwimmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Schwimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Nate_Than_Ever_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Better Nate Than Ever (film)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/0020b271-1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781148", "eventUri": "eng-9781148", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

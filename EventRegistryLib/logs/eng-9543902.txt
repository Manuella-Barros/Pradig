The meeting decided that all the areas of the investigation department should be improved with modern technological innovation, with the introduction of comprehensive reforms. They also discussed the investigation department's upgrade and its integration with the legal department.\n\nThe crime and investigation DIGs gave detailed briefings about the infrastructure, reforms and other necessary points of the investigation department as well as the facilities required by the department.\n\nMemon said computer training courses should be made mandatory for IOs and their teams to make important units like the investigation department effectively integrated and solid. He directed the investigation department that filing challans within the stipulated time of cases, protecting the witnesses, digitally monitoring the cases and conducting crime analysis should also be made part of their priorities.\n\nHe said that opportunities should be given to young police officers in the investigation department, and expert, talented and experienced IOs should provide them all possible guidance and cooperation. Steps are also being taken to give case rewards along with additional financial incentives in the investigation department, he added.\n\nNYPD delegation\n\nA delegation of officers of different cadres of the New York Police Department (NYPD), led by Pakistani American Law Society President Ahmed Khalil, called on the IGP at the Central Police Office to discuss issues of mutual interest.\n\nMemon briefed the guests about various steps being taken in public interest by the Sindh police, the use of modern techniques to fight crime, and its results. He said the Sindh police are moving ahead to prevent crime just like in developed cities of the world, including New York, with an eye on the ongoing policing practices and priorities.\n\nThis is the reason the Sindh police have made significant achievements against crime by taking full advantage of modern technology over the last few years, he added. A member of the delegation said that the Sindh police's use of geofencing and their tracking system to fight crime and catch offenders is commendable.\n\nHe said that since Karachi and New York both are metropolitan cities, the measures taken to protect them and their priorities regarding law and order are almost the same. Khalil said the Sindh police can take advantage of the measures the NYPD employs against street crime, drug mafia, vehicle theft and snatching among other crimes.\n\nIt was later decided that for better and more effective policing, it is necessary that the two police departments promote mutual cooperation. In this regard, the headquarters and IT DIGs were appointed as focal persons by the Sindh police.\n\nMeeting with CM\n\nSindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah met with a delegation of 22 members from the Pakistani American Law Enforcement Society (PALES) of the New York Police Department and discussed their respective policing systems and shared experiences.\n\nDuring the meeting, PALES offered the chief minister to train provincial police officers in dealing with street crime, petty crimes, intelligence work, traffic management, and vigilance. The delegation was led by Rohail Khalid, and incuded officers of different police assignments such as integrity control officer, traffic enforcement, intelligence, training bureau, identification bureau and patrol and others.

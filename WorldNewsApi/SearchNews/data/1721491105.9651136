With his resignation from the post scheduled on Tuesday - which will bring down the number of opposition BJP MLAs in the Aam Aadmi Party-majority House to seven in the 70-member Assembly - the process to choose his replacement has begun gathering pace, as per BJP sources. \u201cThe party will abide by the national leadership\u2019s choice for the post, which is likely to become clear by Tuesday morning, and will be based on various factors ranging from the performance of BJP candidates in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha, 2022 MCD and even the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections,\u201d a senior Delhi BJP leader said. In a letter to Nadda on the matter, Ramvir Bidhuri, who represents the Badarpur Assembly constituency, stated that as per the rules, he needs to resign from either the Assembly or the Lok Sabha within 14 days and will step down from the post of MLA on June 18. Factors ranging from caste to community representation as well as seniority and which area the existing BJP MLAs in the Assembly have been elected from will also be considered, according to another BJP leader. \u201cThe trans-Yamuna or Northeast and East Lok Sabhas, for instance, not only have the most representation in the House with six BJP MLAs from Assembly constituencies falling under these Parliamentary segments, but also at the Centre with the recent elevation of East Delhi BJP MP Harsh Malhotra as Minister of State (MoS) for Road Transport and Highways as well as Corporate Affairs,\u201d the leader said. \u201cFrom the point of view of seniority, Vishwas Nagar MLA O P Sharma, who also comes from the Brahmin community, is among the front-runners along with Karawal Nagar MLA Mohan Singh Bisht; Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta is the only representative who seems to check the right boxes of seniority, caste as well as experience with the post,\u201d a leader said.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/ramvir-bidhuri-requests-bjp-chief-to-relieve-him-of-delhi-assembly-opposition-leader-post-9398538/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Ramvir.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:51:39", "author": "Jatin Anand", "authors": ["Jatin Anand"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.359}

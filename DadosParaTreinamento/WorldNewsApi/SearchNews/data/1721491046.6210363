In a 911 call obtained by News Center 7, a nearby caller told dispatchers they heard a lot of arguing. \u201cThere was a lot of shooting going on,\u201d the caller told dispatchers. \u201cThey out here still arguing.\u201d >> RELATED: \u2018A lot of shooting going on;\u2019 911 caller details early morning shooting in Dayton Police say they found at least one car with windows shot out but no one reported injuries. Yolonda King lives down the street from Sugar\u2019s Lounge. \u201cNo problems for real, they don\u2019t bother me,\u201d King told News Center 7. The police department and the city have a different view. As reported on News Center 7 at 5:30, News Center 7 obtained records that show police asked the city to object to the renewal of the business\u2019s liquor license. They show police seized felony drugs and a gun from a security officer hired to work at the lounge. Another incident involved a shootout in the parking lot involving another security guard. Police claimed that the security guard was untruthful about what happened. The lounge does not have any outside signs but it occupies the same space once used by the popular Upper Krust Deli in Dayton. Now, it could close. City commissioners followed police department requests and voted to oppose the liquor license renewal. This latest incident of large amounts of gunfire does not help the business\u2019s case. \u201cYeah, I kind of hate to see it because they don\u2019t really bother anybody, it\u2019s the people that come, the crowd that comes down there,\u201d King said. If the city has objected to the renewal of the liquor license, there will be a hearing with an agent of the state liquor control commission. Both sides can prevent testimony and then a ruling will happen, which can be appealed, at least once. We will continue following this story.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/weekend-shooting-latest-string-violence-205810673.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/whio_cox_articles_828/aa7c79a47437785b15cfbe6c925572a2", "video": "", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:22:23", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.285}

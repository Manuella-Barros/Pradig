a keen cook - spending more time there in the coming months.\n\nThe Chiefs also play the Jacksonville Jaguars on Saturday night in a practice game ahead of the new season and head coach Andy Reid surprisingly hinted that Kelce and Patrick Mahomes could feature in the game for as much as a quarter.\n\nTeams usually opt against fielding star players in warmup games to avoid them getting hurt before the season properly begins but Reid has said before that he feels it helps players start the season in better form.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Funches", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron Funches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Leggero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natasha Leggero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Byer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Byer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801597", "eventUri": "eng-9801597", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-16", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 117, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-05", "textStart": 1697, "textEnd": 1703}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

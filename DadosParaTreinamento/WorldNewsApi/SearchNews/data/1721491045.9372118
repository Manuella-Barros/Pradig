In snaps obtained by The Sun the couple, who seen together for first time earlier his month, reportedly didn't 'give a hoot' who was saw their romantic display.

Conor Maynard, 31, was spotted locking lips with his new girlfriend during a boozy pub date in London on Sunday It comes amid the fall out from The Traitors star Charlotte Chilton, 32, (pictured) claiming he was the father of her unborn child According to the publication the pair shared a bottle Rose wine ahead of the singer ushering his date into a taxi. An onlooker said: 'There was no hint that Conor was at the centre of a celebrity pregnancy riddle. He looked like he didn't have a care in the world. 'He only had eyes for his pretty partner, and sealed a kiss before rushing her into an Uber taxi. It was neat work, he looked like the cat that got the cream and clearly didn't mind who saw them. They were kissing like school sweethearts in the middle of a busy boozer'. While another added: 'You\u2019d never guess he\u2019d made so many headlines. Conor didn\u2019t give a hoot who saw him and only had eyes for his glamorous companion'. MailOnline has contacted representatives for Conor Maynard for comment. Conor and his girlfriend were previously seen looked tense just days after Charlotte made her bombshell claims. The Traitors star shocked fans by claiming Conor is the father of her unborn baby and had been trying to 'silence' her. The reality star explained the pair had met at the wrap party for The Traitors, as Conor's sister Anna is the girlfriend of the show's winner Harry Clark. In snaps the couple, who seen together for first time earlier his month (pictured) reportedly didn't 'give a hoot' who was saw their romantic display Last week it was reported that Connor had been spotted on celebrity dating app Raya, but looked more loved up than ever with the stunning brunette The party was thrown in honour of the British Army Lance Corporal and 'Traitor', 23, after he shocked the nation when he snatched the \u00a395,150 prize fund from the Faithfuls in a nail-biting finale. Charlotte has now claimed that it was Harry who had 'pressured' her into attending the show wrap party in January because Conor had learnt she was newly-single and wanted to meet her. In an Instagram video, she revealed that she had fallen pregnant with her 'miracle' daughter, after enduring several failed IVF rounds with her estranged wife Laura, and that Conor was the dad. She said: 'I\u2019ve really toyed with whether this is the right thing to do or not... I\u2019ve sort of hidden a lot of things in the protection of somebody else through this process. \u2018I decided that the best thing is to always be open and honest. Essentially I have not named the father in protection of him.\u2019 Charlotte claimed she was warned by a PR that she could be hated if she revealed the news but said the baby means more to her and said keeping a secret had a detrimental impact on her mental health. She said: \u2018I\u2019m prepared to do this alone, but I\u2019m not prepared to have my daughter have to grow up and not be able to say who her father is, or should I say, birth father, or hide it from her.

I\u2019m not a secret, she\u2019s not a dirty secret. I won\u2019t be silenced.\u2019 \u2018I am standing up for myself regardless of if it comes back to me. I just can\u2019t do this be quiet, and shut up anymore. \u2018I feel like I just don\u2019t matter, and I just don\u2019t want that for my daughter so even though this makes me feel sick to do because everyone\u2019s told me not to, in terms of his PR and stuff.\u2019 She concluded: \u2018My friends and family are behind me. The cast are behind me that I need to put Penelope first. When I say the cast, I mean the majority of the cast. But I\u2019m speaking out, I won\u2019t be silenced anymore and now you all know.' Following the shock announcement, Charlotte - who is currently five months pregnant - gave an interview sharing more details on the ill-fated fling. Read More Charlotte Chilton is seen for the first time after revealing Conor Maynard is the father of her baby She told Metro: 'I very nearly didn't go at all [to the party] because I didn't even know who Conor Maynard is. Harry was putting on the pressure. 'Conor was next to me all night pursuing me. I was rude as hell to him for hours, which apparently was the thing he liked. But he was also a gentleman. 'I'd just got out of a really toxic relationship, and I was quite vulnerable to someone being nice to me. If I wanted to go to the toilet, he escorted me. He'd wait outside holding my bag, and take me back.' She revealed the pair ended up sleeping together and hung out the next day, keeping in touch over the phone. They had planned to meet up again but their schedules got in the way and talk soon fizzled out. However, after feeling unwell, Charlotte - who believed she was infertile after her IVF struggles - took a pregnancy test on her mother's advice and discovered she was expecting. Having previously experienced seven miscarriages, she opted to wait until a few weeks later when she was feeling more confident about her pregnancy. Following the shock announcement, Charlotte - who is currently five months pregnant - gave an interview sharing more details on the ill-fated fling She claimed that Conor was initially 'lovely' about the news, but that he later expressed that he was not ready to be a dad She claimed that Conor was initially 'lovely' about the news, but that he later expressed that he was not ready to be a dad. Charlotte shared: 'The minute I started talking about co-parenting and being understanding of his work schedule, he obviously was a bit disappointed that I was doing that.' She now is 'unclear' about the involvement Conor will have in their daughter's life, while the Can't Say No hitmaker has not commented publicly on the news. Meanwhile, her estranged wife Laura Chilton, has since claimed that she and Charlotte were still together when Charlotte slept with the singer in London. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the telecommunications engineer, 33, said she wanted to speak out after being left hurt by comments Charlotte had made about being in a previous 'toxic' relationship and wanted to set the record straight. She said: 'Charlotte has stated in interviews that she was single and had been single since the filming of Traitors which wasn't the case at all. We were still in a relationship when she was filming the show.' Pictures show Charlotte was still wearing her wedding ring when she attended the event in London in January. Meanwhile, her estranged wife Laura Chilton, has since claimed that she and Charlotte were still together when Charlotte slept with the singer in London (pictured together at wedding) Responding to the claims, Laura said she 'had her suspicions' something had happened between Charlotte and Conor as she had cheated on her previously Responding to the claims, Laura said she 'had her suspicions' something had happened between Charlotte and Conor as she had cheated on her previously. Discussing the event where Conor and Charlotte met Laura said: 'She went down to the London for this wrap party - I read she had been forced to go down - she wasn't forced to go at all. 'She was seizing that opportunity. I had a feeling something had gone on because she decided she would stay an extra day - which was obviously the night she got with this Conor Maynard which I had caught wind of as she mentioned to me he had a crush on her and she wasn't interested - we were still together. 'But she is making out to everyone that we weren't together at the time - I want to make it clear that we were.' Read More Conor Maynard 'spotted on dating app Raya' after Charlotte Chilton claimed he's her baby's father Speaking about the baby Laura said: 'I just think more than anything people need to grow up - stop trying to grab a headline by revealing who the father of her baby is and just take accountability and some responsibility - all jokes aside there is another life coming into this now. 'I spoke to Charlotte last night and just said stop it, stop feeding this media attention but it is becoming clear it is what she wants.' The couple had been together for seven years after meeting online and endured a failed IVF attempt. Laura only discovered Charlotte's pregnancy after seeing pictures online, and asked about how she felt she said: 'I can't say that I am sad, the main feeling that I have, I just hope that she and him and the family make the right decision for that child and keep it out of the limelight.' 'I have so many good people around me that have helped me through this whole thing. I can't thank them enough as I might not even be here now but it really does teach to resilience it really does.' Laura said all she wanted now was for everyone involved to do the 'right thing' by the baby. While, Harry has found himself dragged into the middle of the bitter feud between his co-star Charlotte and friend Conor (pictured with Conor last year) Charlotte starred on series two of The Traitors last year alongside eventual winner Harry and was a faithful She said: 'I just want everyone to step up now. She has always loved the attention, she is such a charismatic person, and fun and very witty but unfortunately she can hurt the people who are closest to her.' While, Harry has found himself dragged into the middle of the bitter feud between his co-star Charlotte and friend Conor. A source told The Sun: 'People want Harry to take sides and are getting annoyed that he won\u2019t. 'Harry is doing his best to keep out of it, which is understandable \u2014 not least because he is blameless in the situation. But he is obviously associated with both the show and the Maynard family.'

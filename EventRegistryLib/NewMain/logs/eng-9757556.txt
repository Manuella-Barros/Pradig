Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark, the No. 1 overall draft pick, and Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, the No. 7 pick, lead the debate after Cameron Brink's season ended due to injury.\n\nHistorically, the ROY voting delivers a clear-cut winner. The last close race was in 2019 between Napheesa Collier, the Minnesota Lynx's No. 6 pick, and Arike Ogunbowale, the Dallas Wings' No. 5 pick. Collier won with 29 of the max 43 points, while Ogunbowale pulled the rest. They have each gone on to prolific careers and participated in the 2024 All-Star game. Ogunbowale won MVP for Team WNBA and Collier played limited minutes returning from a foot injury for Team USA.\n\nThe 2015 season was also close between Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd (21 points) and Kiah Stokes (16), with Natalie Achonwa pulling two votes away. And 2014 featured Chiney Ogwumike (23) beating out Odyssey Sims (12), Kayla McBride (2) and Shoni Schimmel (1).\n\nOgwumike and Schimmel were the last rookie duo voted to an All-Star game before Clark and Reese this month. Schimmel earned MVP with a then-record 29 points along with eight assists. Back in Phoenix this year, Clark set a rookie assists record and Reese secured a double-double.\n\nYahoo Sports broke down the cases for and against Clark and Reese in the Rookie of the Year race, and what each can do to strengthen their candidacies.\n\nThe case for Caitlin Clark\n\nClark is tasked with doing more for her team than any rookie in the class, including those veteran first-year players with time overseas. And she's doing it well, even if it's not to the standard fans have become accustomed to when she played in the NCAA's Big Ten. The level of talent in the WNBA was never going to allow for that immediate scoring success, nor is that what the Fever need from her. Plus, she's facing the most defensive pressure any rookie might have ever seen in league history.\n\nThe Fever needed a floor general to feed reigning Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston and former No. 2 overall pick NaLyssa Smith, as well as find guards Kelsey Mitchell and Katie Lou Samuelson on the wing. And she's done that incredibly well.\n\nAlready, she owns the franchise's single-season assists record and secured her first career triple-double. It was the first triple-double by a rookie in the league's 28-year history. The game before the break, she broke Courtney Vandersloot's WNBA single-game assists record with 19 and could have had a few more.\n\nAt the All-Star game, she led Team WNBA to a strong first half and fell one assist shy of Sue Bird's All-Star record. The rookie could have had the mark if she played more down the stretch, but Clark waved off subbing back in for Ogunbowale's record performance.\n\nClark leads the league in assists, lifting the Fever from 11th in assists (18 apg) to sixth this year (20.2). Those numbers could still be higher as teammates aren't always expecting Clark's passes, though recently players are more prepared for her behind-the-back bounces on drives to the basket. In seven of Clark's last nine games, she's had double-digit assists and all were double-doubles.\n\nHer current average would break the rookie record set by legendary point guard Ticha Penicheiro (7.5 apg for Sacramento, 1998) and make her only the fourth rookie averaging at least six assists per game. Not even Sue Bird or Dawn Staley accomplished it in their first years. It would also stand as the fifth-best in league history, trailing four seasons by Vandersloot ('18-21).\n\nTeam success usually doesn't play into a Rookie of the Year race, but it's notable how Clark has changed this franchise within three months. The Fever are two wins away from tying their 2023 record, which was their best since 2019 (when the season was six fewer games). Three wins over the final 15 games, and the Fever will have their best record since 2016 (17-17) when Tamika Catchings was on the court. In the last month, four of their wins are against teams with .500 or better records, including league-leader New York and Commissioner's Cup champion Minnesota. Clark was pivotal in those victories.\n\nAmong rookies, her numbers are almost unilaterally the best. She leads Reese in scoring average by nearly four points with a shooting line of 40.5/32.7/89.1. Her free throw percentage leads the class (of those attempting at least one per game) as does her 1.5 steals per game (which is tied with Reese). She ranks fourth in blocks (0.8), double Reese's average.\n\nClark has more responsibility and a trickier learning curve as a rookie point guard for a franchise mired in disappointment over the last half-decade. And even with that weight of leading the offense, she's breaking franchise and league marks most weeks. Clark will go down as having one of the best rookie seasons in point guard history.\n\nThe case against Caitlin Clark\n\nThis is where everyone is going to yell, \"But the turnovers!\" She leads the league in turnovers (5.6) by a large margin. Alyssa Thomas is second (3.6) with a 27.1% turnover ratio that ranks bottom-third.\n\nIs it great? Of course not. Natasha Cloud, a nine-year veteran, is turning the ball over at a career-high rate of 3.4 times per game leading the Phoenix Mercury offense. Still, that's two times fewer per game than Clark. The context around the numbers is that teammates are still learning Clark's style and high basketball IQ that put passes where most don't attempt. But she has also been turnover prone and averaged at least 4.2 every season in college. She's a high-risk, high-reward player and voters will determine if they feel its more risk or reward when voting.\n\nShe also hasn't been as effective from 3-point range as she was in college. Clark is shooting 32.7% from deep, ranking 47th in the league and down from marks of near 40% as a junior and senior at Iowa.\n\nClark is also at a disadvantage because she's set the standard for which she's judged so high. She makes difficult passes look easy, and has become so synonymous with the logo 3 that when she's not hitting them at the rate we've become accustomed to, she's criticized as struggling.\n\nClark's numbers aren't astronomically higher than other rookies as they were against opponents in college. She'll be dinged for that by some voters, who see Reese's unexpected success as worthy of the best rookie award. It's easy to lose sight of exactly what Clark is doing as a rookie in the best women's basketball league in the world.\n\nWhat Caitlin Clark needs to do in the second half\n\nClark's Rookie of the Year case is already strong, but it could be lifted with less turnovers and a better shooting clip from logo land. That's attainable with the Olympic break. Clark has been playing nonstop at an elite team-leading level since November and it's clear her legs aren't as fresh. She said during All-Star weekend that not picking up a basketball for a week would be good for her. Defense is a years-long process for elite guards in the WNBA, but showing some progress there would help as well.\n\nRest and practice time with new teammates will only make Clark stronger in the now, and create a solid Rookie of the Year candidacy that will be hard to ignore. But she needs to continue to pack the stat sheet, rather than shoot only for points, as that gives Indiana the best chances at winning -- and some voters have already said the race might come down to team success.\n\nLet's start with the obvious: Double-doubles. Reese owns the record for most consecutive double-doubles with 15. Not only does that mean she's accomplished a feat no other rookie has, it means she's done something no one else in the league -- past or present -- can lay claim to. It's impressive, especially when you consider that she passed Candace Parker to earn the accolade.\n\nAnother facet that sets Reese apart is her ability to hit the glass on offense. She's averaging 4.7 offensive rebounds per game, which is the most in the WNBA by a wide margin. That means her team gets nearly five more possessions a game, thanks to her ability to hunt the ball. For evidence of her prowess, look no further than the All-Star game. Reese finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds against Team USA, proving her ability to score and rebound against the best players in the world. Five of those rebounds came on offense, meaning her squad got five more opportunities to score.\n\nFor Chicago, Reese is averaging 13.5 points and 12 rebounds per game. As a rebounder and defender, she leads all rookies, and her 1.5 steals per game is the 10th-best mark in the league. She's also leading the league in total rebounds per game, grabbing more than players like A'ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier and Dearica Hamby, who have earned reputations as elite rebounders.\n\nWhat Reese is doing on the glass is unprecedented, and her records put the rookie in elite company. In an 88-87 win over Indiana on June 23, Reese propelled the Sky to victory with 25 points and 16 rebounds, making her the first rookie since Wilson to have 25 points and 15 boards in a game.\n\nThe case against Angel Reese\n\nThere are two arguments against Reese when it comes to her merit as ROY. The first is her low shooting percentage, and the second is the notion that most of her offensive rebounds come on her own misses. Let's address the shooting percentage first, because it is a legitimate knock on Reese's performance this season. She's shooting 40.9% from 2-point range, which is in the bottom 12% of WNBA players. As a post player whose shot attempts typically come around the rim, that number is much lower than it should be. However, it is steadily rising as the season progresses. In June, Reese was shooting 34.5% from the field. In college, Reese shot 49.8% from the field, which, coupled with her ever-improving percentage as a pro, it's likely that her overall numbers will improve throughout her career. That bodes well for Reese's career, but doesn't mean anything for the ROY race. If she wants to take home the award, she needs to be much more efficient around the rim.\n\nThe second argument against Reese actually doesn't have much merit. Stephen Noh of the Sporting News debunked the myth earlier this month, and calculated that even without the rebounds Reese collects on her own misses, she is still far and away the best offensive rebounder in the country. If you deduct those rebounds from her average, Reese is still grabbing 0.8 more offensive boards per game than any other player, with Ezi Magbegor coming in second.\n\nPlus, even if all of Reese's rebounds came on her own misses, that still doesn't negate the fact that she's getting the rebound. There are nine other players on the court with her, and they all want the ball as well. But Reese is the one coming up with it. That speaks to her basketball skills, motor and effort all at once.\n\nWhat Angel Reese needs to do in the second half\n\nIf Reese becomes more efficient in the second half of the season, her Rookie of the Year resume gets much stronger. The top bigs in the league, players like Wilson, Nneka Ogwumike and last season's ROY, Aliyah Boston, are all shooting around 50% from the field. That's the number Reese should be striving for in the second half.\n\nReese is a solid defender with length and quick hands, as evidenced by her 1.5 steals per game, but she could still do more on the defensive end. As a 6-3 forward, Reese is averaging just 0.4 blocks per game. In college she was a solid shot-blocker, averaging 1.3 per game during her time at LSU. And who could forget the iconic video of her rejecting an opponent with one hand, while holding her shoe in the other? More of that would certainly help her case for ROY.\n\nChicago also needs to continue winning if Reese wants to take home the award. Typically, wins don't matter in the ROY race. The top rookies are often drafted to losing teams, and last season Boston won the award while playing for the 13-27 Fever. But in a tight competition for the award, wins could come into play. Especially since both Clark's Fever and Reese's Sky are fighting for playoff spots. The top eight teams earn postseason bids. Indiana is currently in seventh with an 11-15 record, and Chicago is eighth with a 10-14 record. If one rookie plays a major role in her team earning a playoff spot with a strong end to the season, that could give her a level up in the ROY race.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

The last close race was in 2019 between Napheesa Collier, the Minnesota Lynx's No. 6 pick, and Arike Ogunbowale, the Dallas Wings' No. 5 pick. Collier won with 29 of the max 43 points, while Ogunbowale pulled the rest. They have each gone on to prolific careers and participated in the 2024 All-Star game. Ogunbowale won MVP for Team WNBA and Collier played limited minutes returning from a foot injury for Team USA.\n\nThe 2015 season was also close between Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd (21 points) and Kiah Stokes (16), with Natalie Achonwa pulling two votes away. And 2014 featured Chiney Ogwumike (23) beating out Odyssey Sims (12), Kayla McBride (2) and Shoni Schimmel (1).\n\nOgwumike and Schimmel were the last rookie duo voted to an All-Star game before Clark and Reese this month. Schimmel earned MVP with a then-record 29 points along with eight assists. Back in Phoenix this year, Clark set a rookie assists record and Reese secured a double-double.\n\nYahoo Sports broke down the cases for and against Clark and Reese in the Rookie of the Year race, and what each can do to strengthen their candidacies.\n\nClark is tasked with doing more for her team than any rookie in the class, including with time overseas. And she's doing it well, even if it's not to the standard fans have become accustomed to when she played in the NCAA's Big Ten. The level of talent in the WNBA was never going to allow for that immediate scoring success, nor is that what the Fever need from her. Plus, she's facing the most defensive pressure any rookie might have ever seen in league history.\n\nThe Fever needed a floor general to feed reigning Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston and former No. 2 overall pick NaLyssa Smith, as well as find guards Kelsey Mitchell and Katie Lou Samuelson on the wing. And she's done that incredibly well.\n\nAlready, she owns the franchise's single-season assists record and secured her first career triple-double. It was the in the league's 28-year history. The game before the break, she broke Courtney Vandersloot's and could have had a few more.\n\nAt the All-Star game, she led Team WNBA to a strong first half and fell one assist shy of Sue Bird's All-Star record. The rookie could have had the mark if she played more down the stretch, but Clark waved off subbing back in for Ogunbowale's record performance.\n\nClark leads the league in assists, lifting the Fever from 11th in assists (18 apg) to sixth this year (20.2). Those numbers could still be higher as teammates aren't always expecting Clark's passes, though recently players are more prepared for her behind-the-back bounces on drives to the basket. In seven of Clark's last nine games, she's had double-digit assists and all were double-doubles.\n\nHer current average would break the rookie record set by legendary point guard Ticha Penicheiro (7.5 apg for Sacramento, 1998) and make her only the fourth rookie averaging at least six assists per game. Not even Sue Bird or Dawn Staley accomplished it in their first years. It would also stand as the fifth-best in league history, trailing four seasons by Vandersloot ('18-21).\n\nTeam success usually doesn't play into a Rookie of the Year race, but it's notable how Clark has changed this franchise within three months. The Fever are two wins away from tying their 2023 record, which was their best since 2019 (when the season was six fewer games). Three wins over the final 15 games, and the Fever will have their best record since 2016 (17-17) when Tamika Catchings was on the court. In the last month, four of their wins are against teams with .500 or better records, including league-leader New York and Commissioner's Cup champion Minnesota. Clark was pivotal in those victories.\n\nAmong rookies, her numbers are almost unilaterally the best. She leads Reese in scoring average by nearly four points with a shooting line of 40.5/32.7/89.1. Her free throw percentage leads the class (of those attempting at least one per game) as does her 1.5 steals per game (which is tied with Reese). She ranks fourth in blocks (0.8), double Reese's average.\n\nClark has more responsibility and a trickier learning curve as a rookie point guard for a franchise mired in disappointment over the last half-decade. And even with that weight of leading the offense, she's breaking franchise and league marks most weeks. Clark will go down as having one of the best rookie seasons in point guard history.\n\nThis is where everyone is going to yell, \"But the turnovers!\" She leads the league in turnovers (5.6) by a large margin. Alyssa Thomas is second (3.6) with a 27.1% turnover ratio that ranks bottom-third.\n\nIs it great? Of course not. Natasha Cloud, a nine-year veteran, is turning the ball over at a career-high rate of 3.4 times per game leading the Phoenix Mercury offense. Still, that's two times fewer per game than Clark. The context around the numbers is that teammates are still learning Clark's style and high basketball IQ that put passes where most don't attempt. But she has also been turnover prone and averaged at least 4.2 every season in college. She's a high-risk, high-reward player and voters will determine if they feel its more risk or reward when voting.\n\nShe also hasn't been as effective from 3-point range as she was in college. Clark is shooting 32.7% from deep, ranking 47th in the league and down from marks of near 40% as a junior and senior at Iowa.\n\nClark is also at a disadvantage because she's set the standard for which she's judged so high. She makes difficult passes look easy, and has become so synonymous with the logo 3 that when she's not hitting them at the rate we've become accustomed to, she's criticized as struggling.\n\nClark's numbers aren't astronomically higher than other rookies as they were against opponents in college. She'll be dinged for that by some voters, who see Reese's unexpected success as worthy of the best rookie award. It's easy to lose sight of exactly what Clark is doing as a rookie in the best women's basketball league in the world.\n\nClark's Rookie of the Year case is already strong, but it could be lifted with less turnovers and a better shooting clip from logo land. That's attainable with the Olympic break. Clark has been playing nonstop at an elite team-leading level since November and it's clear her legs aren't as fresh. She said during All-Star weekend that not picking up a basketball for a week would be good for her. Defense is a years-long process for elite guards in the WNBA, but showing some progress there would help as well.\n\nRest and practice time with new teammates will only make Clark stronger in the now, and create a solid Rookie of the Year candidacy that will be hard to ignore. But she needs to continue to pack the stat sheet, rather than shoot only for points, as that gives Indiana the best chances at winning -- and some voters have already said the race might come down to team success.\n\n-- Negley\n\nLet's start with the obvious: Double-doubles. Reese owns the record for most consecutive double-doubles with 15. Not only does that mean she's accomplished a feat no other rookie has, it means she's done something no one else in the league -- past or present -- can lay claim to. It's impressive, especially when you consider that she passed Candace Parker to earn the accolade.\n\nAnother facet that sets Reese apart is her ability to hit the glass on offense. She's averaging 4.7 offensive rebounds per game, which is the most in the WNBA by a wide margin. That means her team gets nearly five more possessions a game, thanks to her ability to hunt the ball. For evidence of her prowess, look no further than the All-Star game. Reese finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds against Team USA, proving her ability to score and rebound against the best players in the world. Five of those rebounds came on offense, meaning her squad got five more opportunities to score.\n\nFor Chicago, Reese is averaging 13.5 points and 12 rebounds per game. As a rebounder and defender, she leads all rookies, and her 1.5 steals per game is the 10th-best mark in the league. She's also leading the league in total rebounds per game, grabbing more than players like A'ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier and Dearica Hamby, who have earned reputations as elite rebounders.\n\nWhat Reese is doing on the glass is unprecedented, and her records put the rookie in elite company. In an 88-87 win over Indiana on June 23, Reese propelled the Sky to victory with 25 points and 16 rebounds, making her the first rookie since Wilson to have 25 points and 15 boards in a game.\n\nThere are two arguments against Reese when it comes to her merit as ROY. The first is her low shooting percentage, and the second is the notion that most of her offensive rebounds come on her own misses. Let's address the shooting percentage first, because it is a legitimate knock on Reese's performance this season. She's shooting 40.9% from 2-point range, which is in the bottom 12% of WNBA players. As a post player whose shot attempts typically come around the rim, that number is much lower than it should be. However, it is steadily rising as the season progresses. In June, Reese was shooting 34.5% from the field. In college, Reese shot 49.8% from the field, which, coupled with her ever-improving percentage as a pro, it's likely that her overall numbers will improve throughout her career. That bodes well for Reese's career, but doesn't mean anything for the ROY race. If she wants to take home the award, she needs to be much more efficient around the rim.\n\nThe second argument against Reese actually doesn't have much merit. Stephen Noh of the Sporting News debunked the myth earlier this month, and calculated that even without the rebounds Reese collects on her own misses, she is still far and away the best offensive rebounder in the country. If you deduct those rebounds from her average, Reese is still grabbing 0.8 more offensive boards per game than any other player, with Ezi Magbegor coming in second.\n\nPlus, even if all of Reese's rebounds came on her own misses, that still doesn't negate the fact that she's getting the rebound. There are nine other players on the court with her, and they all want the ball as well. But Reese is the one coming up with it. That speaks to her basketball skills, motor and effort all at once.\n\nIf Reese becomes more efficient in the second half of the season, her Rookie of the Year resume gets much stronger. The top bigs in the league, players like Wilson, Nneka Ogwumike and last season's ROY, Aliyah Boston, are all shooting around 50% from the field. That's the number Reese should be striving for in the second half.\n\nReese is a solid defender with length and quick hands, as evidenced by her 1.5 steals per game, but she could still do more on the defensive end. As a 6-3 forward, Reese is averaging just 0.4 blocks per game. In college she was a solid shot-blocker, averaging 1.3 per game during her time at LSU. And who could forget the iconic video of her rejecting an opponent with one hand, while holding her shoe in the other? More of that would certainly help her case for ROY.\n\nChicago also needs to continue winning if Reese wants to take home the award. Typically, wins don't matter in the ROY race. The top rookies are often drafted to losing teams, and last season Boston won the award while playing for the 13-27 Fever. But in a tight competition for the award, wins could come into play. Especially since both Clark's Fever and Reese's Sky are fighting for playoff spots. The top eight teams earn postseason bids. Indiana is currently in seventh with an 11-15 record, and Chicago is eighth with a 10-14 record. If one rookie plays a major role in her team earning a playoff spot with a strong end to the season, that could give her a level up in the ROY race.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

This incudes Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark, who was an All-Star in her rookie season, but was not named to Team USA.\n\nClark has expressed a level of excitement to finally get an extended break after what has been a hectic few months since being drafted first-overall after a historic collegiate career at Iowa. Entering the Olympic break, Clark shared a post on Instagram that has been going viral.\n\nThe post included 10 pictures of Clark from All-Star Weekend, and a four-word caption that read, \"First WNBA All-Star.\"\n\nWhile Clark did not shoot well in the All-Star Game, she did record a rookie record 10 assists to help lead Team WNBA to a victory over Team USA. As she has done so many times this season, Clark achieved something in the All-Star Game that no rookie in league history had achieved.\n\nAfter Team WNBA's victory over Team USA, many argued that both Clark and Dallas Wings star Arike Ogunbowale (who won All-Star Game MVP) proved they should have made USA Basketball's Paris Olympics roster.

Speaking on SiriusXM NBA Radio on Monday, Lobo declared Clark the \"best passer in the league,\" a praise that comes just halfway through Clark's inaugural WNBA season.\n\n\"She's incredible,\" Lobo added, per Scott Thompson of Fox News.\n\nClark, known for her remarkable three-point shooting, has consistently showcased exceptional court vision, a skill she honed during her college career at Iowa. Her ability to involve teammates on the floor has translated well to the professional level. As of the All-Star/Olympic break, Clark leads the league with an average of 8.2 assists per game. Indiana Fever head coach Christie Sides noted that the team has adapted well to Clark's dynamic playmaking.\n\n\"The team has gotten used to how Clark wants to move the ball when it is in her hands on offense,\" Sides said.\n\nHowever, Clark's aggressive style of play has also resulted in a high turnover rate, averaging 5.6 per game.\n\n\"Her turnovers are always going to be a little bit high because of the chances she takes, especially with get-ahead passes. She's looking to thread the needle. Oftentimes, it makes it there, and sometimes it doesn't,\" Lobo said.\n\nCaitlin Clark breaks WNBA assist record\n\nClark's record-breaking performance against the Dallas Wings on July 17, where she set a new WNBA single-game record with 19 assists, underscores her exceptional playmaking abilities. Despite the Fever's loss in that game, Clark's achievement was a notable highlight. Additionally, Clark shined in the WNBA All-Star Game, where she recorded 10 assists, setting a rookie record for the event. She fell just one assist short of tying the overall All-Star Game record held by Sue Bird.\n\nLobo believes that Clark's game will continue to evolve, reducing turnovers and improving her shooting accuracy.\n\n\"And what's remarkable, too, is that she still hasn't found her 3-point shot at the rate that she will, but has adjusted,\" Lobo said.\n\nCurrently, Clark is shooting 32.7% from three-point range, attempting 8.3 per game, and overall shooting 40.5% from the field, averaging 19.6 points per game.\n\nLobo added, \"She's taking fewer logo bombs, she's driving more and finishing.\"\n\nDuring the All-Star Game in Phoenix, Clark not only excelled in passing but also demonstrated her leadership on the court. Despite not making any three-pointers in the game, her ability to facilitate scoring for her teammates was obvious. Arike Ogunbowale, who scored 34 points and was named MVP, benefited from Clark's assists, particularly during a critical 9-2 run that helped Team WNBA pull ahead of the Team USA Olympians.\n\nClark assisted on several key baskets, including those made by her Fever teammates Kelsey Mitchell and Aliyah Boston.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Lobo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Lobo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fever-news-Caitlin-Clark-earns-best-passer-declaration-from-Rebecca-Lobo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1372, "textEnd": 1379}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Entering the Olympic break, Clark shared a post on Instagram that has been going viral.\n\nThe post included 10 pictures of Clark from All-Star Weekend, and a four-word caption that read, \"First WNBA All-Star.\"\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nWhile Clark did not shoot well in the All-Star Game, she did record a rookie record 10 assists to help lead Team WNBA to a victory over Team USA. As she has done so many times this season, Clark achieved something in the All-Star Game that no rookie in league history had achieved.\n\nAfter Team WNBA's victory over Team USA, many argued that both Clark and Dallas Wings star Arike Ogunbowale (who won All-Star Game MVP) proved they should have made USA Basketball's Paris Olympics roster. While that may be a fair argument, Clark pushed back against this narrative after the game.\n\n\"They're really good,\" Clark said of Team USA. \"They have plenty of talent on that team...

After this incredible stretch, she followed it up with a great performance in her victory over Team USA in the All-Star Game.\n\nUnfortunately, this All-Star Weekend was the last to be seen of Clark for nearly a month, as the WNBA goes on their break for the Olympics. That said, fans are still raving about Clark online, even over a video of her incredible evolution that went viral.\n\nThis video shows a growth from Clark as she went from being 5'7 at 14 years old, to now 6'0. While this may not seem like much in comparison to the NBA, she's incredibly tall for a guard in the WNBA. It's also remarkable that she grew a couple inches in her later years when most stop growing.

Another hyped supporter even exaggerated it and said that Clark isn't only the best passer in the league but also \"on the planet, in the galaxy.\"\n\n\"Adapt, adjust, attack. Multidimensional players are the hardest to scheme for. Clark has always been an excellent passer (1st All Time scoring BUT ALSO 3rd ALL Time in Assists for NCAA women).

There are over twice the number of women betting on WNBA games in the first half of this season using the same year-over-year comparison metrics.\n\n\"BetMGM has already taken as many bets for the first half of the 2024 season as we did for all of 2023,\" said Michael Ranftle, BetMGM senior sports trader. \"Between more player prop offerings, the 'Caitlin Clark Effect' and the incredible rise in popularity of the WNBA, we're experiencing historic increases in betting on the WNBA.\"\n\nPer BetMGM, WNBA bettors are placing nearly five times more player prop bets on Clark than any other WNBA player during the first half of the season, followed by fellow rookie, Angel Reese.\n\nEntering the WNBA as the No. 1 overall pick from the University of Iowa, Clark hasn't taken much time to grab the spotlight.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever are also the most heavily bet team to win the WNBA Championship, receiving 21.6% of tickets at BetMGM. Clark is the overwhelming favorite to win MVP, earning 54.9% of tickets and 43.9% of the betting handle for the award.\n\nOptimove Insights studies found a similar outcome, with a 380% increase in Fever wagers placed in 2024. This has led to a 162% rise in non-Clark games over the baseline.\n\nPerhaps the biggest off-the-court indicator of Clark's impact can be measured with fan attendance this season. The average attendance at a 2024 WNBA game is 9,300, which is the highest mark the league has seen in more than two decades. This includes two games with more than 20,000 fans in attendance.\n\nBefore 2024, only four games recorded 20,000 spectators since the WNBA became a league in 1997. Fever home game attendance has spiked from 4,000 fans per game in 2023 to 16,800 with Clark on the court in 2024.\n\nClark leads the league in assists per game (8.2) and recently broke the WNBA record for most assists in a game, finishing with 19 assists in a losing effort against the Dallas Wings on July 17.\n\nShe also performed well in the WNBA All-Star Game, helping the All-Star lineup beat Team USA 117-109, with 10 assists, two steals, four points, and one rebound.\n\nClark has scored 20-plus points in 10 out of 26 games played during her rookie campaign with the Fever. She's also recorded at least 10 assists per game in seven of her past nine games, demonstrating her elite passing ability and helping the Fever rank sixth in total points (81.8) per game.\n\nHer biggest single-game feat came in taking down the league's best team, the New York Liberty, when she recorded a triple-double, finishing the game with 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/ddd27c25-c1e9-473d-acea-ef9eec7977a4.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 2319, "textEnd": 2326}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Caitlin Clark belongs on the Olympic team.'\n\nClark's popularity aside, Cowherd brought up how her ability to spread the floor would be beneficial to the team in France this summer.\n\nDuring the All-Star game, Clark lead both sides in assists with 10 dimes despite a slow scoring performance. Meanwhile, Dallas Wings star Arike Ogunbowale tallied 34 points in the victory.\n\nClark is in a head-to-head race with Chicago's Angel Reese for the Rookie of the Year award\n\n'The more I watch Caitlin Clark, the more I'm convinced basketball is not quite ready,' He said. 'She is more than ready. She helped her WNBA All-Star team beat the USA Olympic team this weekend.'\n\n'She was the best playmaker. One of her teammates had 34 points, and Caitlin just kept feeding her the ball. The most assists in the win, double-digit assists in seven of her last eight games.'\n\n'She's also, in my opinion, a perfect Olympic or All-Star player, especially Olympics. All-Star games are a little bit of showing off. But [in the] Olympics, you have to be a facilitator, not a ball hog. I would argue Clark passes too much.'\n\nSo far this season, Clark is averaging 17.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists as the Indiana Fever have emerged as a playoff team.\n\nWith 14 games left in a season with handprints of her popularity all over, Clark is also in a head-to-head race with Angel Reese for the Rookie of the Year honor.\n\n'The women's Olympic team said: 'You know if we put her on the team, there's no question she's gonna be a distraction.' You know what's a distraction? Her not [being] on the team.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not only does she consistently break records with her play, but she's also broken a ton of viewership records.\n\nThis effect has been around since college, as she revolutionized the women's March Madness tournament, creating countless unforgettable moments. That said, the same has been happening in the WNBA, and most recently in the All-Star Game, in which she \"destroyed\" the previous viewership record. Many fans believe this to be another result of the \"Caitlin Clark Effect\".\n\nWhile some fans don't like the term, her impact on the league is undeniable.\n\nThough Clark deserves a lot of credit, fans do believe that fellow rookie Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky deserves credit too.\n\nFurthermore, multiple fans were still upset that they weren't playing together on Team USA, especially after their victory over them.\n\nAnother fan added that All-Star Game MVP Arike Ogunbowale also deserved a spot on the team. She withdrew herself from consideration, but it's still cool to see the support from fans.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this will be the last time they play together for a while, but it will certainly happen again. It is remarkable what both Clark and Reese have done for the league in such a short amount of time, and it will be even more remarkable to see what they'll do after multiple years in the league.\n\nRelated: WNBA Fans Unite in Agreement with Caitlin Clark After her Head-Turning Comment On Upcoming Break", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hunter_simpson@postandcourier.com", "name": "Hunter Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-star_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-star game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After being left off the U.S. women's basketball team roster, she will not return to the floor until the Fever play again on August 16.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Drops Clear Seven-Word Message About Watching Team USA in Paris After Olympics Snub", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_dougherty@postandcourier.com", "name": "Nathan Dougherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 1202, "textEnd": 1211}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

In the same breath, the former All-Star also dropped a truth bomb about one specific area of Clark's game that the 22-year-old has yet to unlock.\n\n\"What's remarkable too is she still hasn't found her 3-point shot at the rate that she will,\" Lobo said. \"She's adjusted. She's taking less of the logo bombs. She's driving more and finishing. So she's getting she's getting her points that way.\"\n\nThat's an excellent observation that should strike fear in the rest of the league.\n\nClark is knocking down 2.7 triples per game at a 32.7 percent clip. For context, the former Iowa superstar averaged 5.2 makes from beyond the arc in her senior year with the Hawkeyes. In her iconic four-year college career, Clark averaged 37.7 percent from deep.\n\nThe level of competition in the NCAA and the WNBA is obviously miles apart, but as Lobo implied, it should only be a matter of time before Clark finds her 3-point shot now that she's in the pros.", "source": {"uri": "athlonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Athlon Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paolo_songco@athlonsports.com", "name": "Paolo Songco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Lobo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Lobo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://athlonsports.com/.image/t_share/MjA3MTQ5MTE4NjM4NzkzOTE1/usatsi_23541918.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

'CAITLIN CLARK IS NOT QUITE READY! LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES!'... The more I watch Caitlin Clark, the more I think WOMEN'S BASKETBALL is not ready. Caitlin Clark is more than ready.\n\nShe helped her WNBA All-Star team beat the U.S. Olympic Team this weekend. She had 10 assists and was the best playmaker. One of her teammates scored 34 and she just kept feeding her the ball. She had the most assists in the win and has had double-digit assists in seven of her last eight games. The WNBA butchered her early schedule and snubbed her from the Olympics. Now the Indiana Fever are a potential playoff team. She stretches the floor, she's great with spacing, and she's a perfect Olympics or All-Star player, especially Olympics. All-Star Games are a little showing off, but the Olympics - if you're not the first, second, or third-best player on the team; and she wouldn't be yet - you need to be a facilitator, not a ball hog. I would argue that she passes too much.\n\nThe women's Olympic team said 'IF WE PUT HER ON THE TEAM, THERE'S NO QUESTION SHE'S GOING TO BE A DISTRACTION!'... Well, you know what's a 'distraction'? Her NOT on the team. That's what everyone's talking about.\n\nI've learned with women's basketball as a whole, they're very much like men's soccer in America. They're a little petty, they've been ignored to a larger degree than other sports, they've got a chip on their shoulder, and they're sort of a 'PROVE YOU BELONG!'... With men's soccer, it's like you have to have a passcode to even talk about the sport online, and for women's basketball it's this constant 'PROVE YOU BELONG!'... Caitlin Clark BELONGS on the Olympic team, she BELONGS on the All-Star team, she BELONGS in the Skills Competition...\n\nAnd here's the other thing, women's basketball. You can't use the excuse that she 'caught you off-guard.' A lot of times, overnight sensations do catch businesses off-guard, but two years before she entered the WNBA, Caitlin Clark, for little Iowa, was setting college basketball records. You knew two years in advance 'oh, we got a star', and one year in advance 'she'll be the number one pick.' There was no excuse butchering her early schedule [making it too difficult]. There's no excuse not having months and months of discussions on the Olympic team. She's clearly one of the better long-range performers in the league, and I'd argue she's the first or second-best playmaker. She leads the WNBA in assists, and this is for a team that doesn't have a lot of finishers.\n\nShe always says the right thing at the right time at the podium, and she's gonna downplay this win by her All-Star team over the 'coveted' Olympic team that 'SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ON!'... So far, she's more than prepared and capable, it's women's basketball that's not quite ready for Caitlin Clark.\"\n\nMark Carnevale, PGA Tour Winner Turned Announcer, Dies at 64\n\nAubrey Plaza

The two played four years together, leading the program to two straight national title appearances in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThey turned the women's basketball program into one of the most talked-about teams in sports. Martin believes the Hawkeyes can pick up where they left off, as long as they don't put limitations on themselves.\n\n\"For the rest of the summer, have the mindset, like, 'Why not?

Nneka Ogwumike flew to Houston to spend time with family. And Sabrina Ionescu spent so much time off her feet trying to get healthy, she said, \"I don't think I touched a basketball for a month.\"\n\nFor some of the top picks in past WNBA drafts, the league's Olympic break -- which started July 21 and runs until Aug. 14 this season, with almost 30 of the league's 143 players scheduled to compete in Paris -- was more than nice.\n\nIt was necessary.\n\nThe American women begin the journey to defend their Olympic gold medal for a record eighth time July 29 when they meet Japan in the first game of pool play at the 2024 Paris Games. Missing from the roster: Record-setting rookie Caitlin Clark, who some believed was a lock for Team USA.\n\nClark, who has no senior national team experience, was left off in favor of older, more experienced guards (the youngest player is 26-year-old Ionescu). Clark has put on a show her first 26 games as a pro, leading the league in assists per game (8.2), rookies in scoring per game (17.1) and recording the first triple-double by a rookie. Given her stats, some were outraged at her exclusion, convinced it was a snub. Others said the break would be welcome for the 22-year-old phenom.\n\nThe numbers back up the latter assertion. A USA TODAY Sports study of past top picks and their WNBA stats proves rookies who got nearly a month off in the middle of their first professional season benefited from the break.\n\nConsider Jefferson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2016. While No. 1 pick and UConn teammate Breanna Stewart made her Olympic debut in Rio -- the third major tournament she'd played with the senior national team -- Jefferson took a few weeks to breathe.\n\nLike Clark, Jefferson had just played in consecutive Final Fours and barely had time to sleep before being drafted by the San Antonio Stars and starting training camp. When the league paused play for the Olympics in early August, Jefferson hopped on a plane bound for the Caribbean.\n\n\"It's huge, that break,\" Jefferson, now with the Chicago Sky, told USA TODAY Sports. \"You're in college and two weeks later, you're trying to score against the best (players in the world). Especially for point guards, you're trying to be a leader for your team while you're figuring all that out. The break is gonna give (rookies) a chance to decompress -- they need that -- and then to break down the game and see, 'This is where I've been good, this is where I've been bad.' \"\n\nAfter WNBA Olympic break, a big boost in production\n\nWhen she returned to San Antonio after a week of sunshine, Jefferson studied film of her first 23 games, when she averaged 12.2 points and 4.0 rebounds. At just 5-foot-6, 130 pounds, Jefferson learned quickly that her body could not handle non-stop drives to the rim, where she was likely to be body checked by bigger, stronger, older pros.\n\nJefferson needed to be able to get in the lane and get a shot off without getting clobbered. So she started working on her floater package and midrange game, studying where and when she could exploit matchups with her speed.\n\nThe boost in production was noticeable: In 11 games after the Olympics, she averaged 17.5 points and 4.6 assists, an uptick she credits to time off.\n\n\"Jumping right into the pros, it's a lot,\" said Jefferson, who scored in double figures every game after the break. \"You're learning new plays, new teammates, transitioning to a whole different game. When I got back and was working out two, three times a day, we had a strategic and very specific routine. I really started learning my spots: When do I come off this screen, how do I get to the elbow, when am I hesitating and getting downhill, how can I use my speed to my advantage and learn change of pace in the WNBA.\"\n\nAnother positive: Because of those few weeks of extra rest, Jefferson never felt like she hit the dreaded rookie wall.\n\nClark, who's been playing since last August without a break, has already proven to have nearly unlimited stamina. But because the Fever opened with a brutally tough, and packed, schedule, she's also looking forward to a few weeks off.\n\n\"It'll be huge,\" said Clark, who set the WNBA single-game assist record in her final game before the Olympic pause. \"Obviously we'll get a little bit of a break at the beginning, but then we'll have quite a bit of time to just practice and really get better. Once we come back, those (last 14) games are going to be super important for the playoff push that we hope to make.\"\n\nIndiana coach Christie Sides is looking forward to it, too, not only because the Fever will finally have some quality practice time.\n\n\"During that break, you also get a lot of team time,\" Sides said. \"You get to spend time with each other where there's not games, so you can do team (bonding) events. We've got some stuff planned for them that we're really excited about.\"\n\nIn first pro season, three weeks off is 'golden' for WNBA rookies\n\nThe best player comparison for Clark is probably Ionescu, the No. 1 pick in 2020 who, like Clark, loves to stuff the stat sheet, has deep shooting range and is of similar size and build (Ionescu is 5-foot-11, 165 pounds; Clark is 6-foot, 152 pounds).\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Ionescu's true rookie season was 2021. She suffered a severe ankle sprain in her third game of 2020, and missed the rest of the COVID-shortened season.\n\nAfter offseason surgery, she returned to the floor in 2021 and did a little bit of everything for the New York Liberty. She averaged 9.9 points, 6.0 assists and 5.7 rebounds in her first 19 games despite the fact that \"I literally could not walk without excruciating pain,\" Ionescu said.\n\nDuring her almost month off during the Tokyo Olympics, Ionescu flew home to the Bay Area and rehabbed like crazy, desperate to get healthy. She stayed off the basketball court, watching film as she iced, stretched and strengthened her ankle.\n\nIt worked. Ionescu's stats improved to 14.8 points and 6.3 assists per game, while her field goal percentage rose from 35.2% to 41.2%. What's more, she came back happier and healthier.\n\n\"Without that break, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish the season,\" Ionescu said. \"... That time off gives you an opportunity to reset, get your mind off basketball and then you come back to practice feeling fresh. There are no more 'firsts' -- you've already played your first game, and now you know what to expect. That break gets you excited to play again.\"\n\nHighly drafted guards aren't the only ones who benefit from a break. Forwards like the vacation, too -- which means Chicago rookie Angel Reese, Clark's biggest competition for 2024 Rookie of the Year after setting a WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles (15), should also profit.\n\nOgwumike would know. Like Jefferson, Ogwumike began her pro career after playing in four consecutive Final Fours, a rare, and exhausting, feat. The Stanford grad was an instant contributor for the Los Angeles Sparks after going No. 1 overall in 2012, averaging 14.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in her first 20 games. While her points and rebounds mostly stayed the same after the London OIympics (13.9 points, 7.4 rebounds), her shooting percentage vaulted from 50.7% to 58.1%; she finished fourth in the league in that category.\n\n\"It's rare to get this sort of chance to breathe in the middle of the season,\" said Ogwumike, now in her first season with the Seattle Storm. \"Especially your first year in the league, you can reset, reorient and figure out, 'What do I want to get better at, how do I want to do things differently?' \"\n\nOgwumike gushes about the Olympic pause to anyone and everyone, especially newcomers.\n\nHer specific phrasing of choice: \"I tell them, this Olympic break is golden.\"\n\nMaybe it's not of the medal variety, Ogwumike acknowledged.

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Have feedback for the Layup Lines Crew? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey. Now, here's Prince J. Grimes.\n\nHi, folks. Welcome back to Layup Lines. With Summer League officially over, I know we'll all be turning our full attention to the Olympics soon, but before that I want to talk about one strange anomaly I've noticed with this year's rookie class.\n\nI can't remember a time where my confidence in a Rookie of the Year front-runner has diminished so much through each stage of the summer quite like it has this year.\n\nBefore the draft, I was pretty sure Alex Sarr was the best player entering the league and the likely best Rookie of the Year candidate. After Sarr slid to No. 2 in the draft, I still felt good about him but had to at least consider there was maybe a better bet out there. Now, after Summer League, I'm not even sure he's the best bet on his own team (I see you Bub Carrington!). And I have absolutely no clue who should be considered the favorite.\n\nI know I'm not alone because Bronny James is BetMGM's most-bet player and biggest liability to win the award. Bronny James!\n\nOddsmakers still favor Zach Edey, who only needed one Summer League game to overtake Sarr as the favorite. But even that doesn't feel quite right either.\n\nAt +600, Edey's odds at BetMGM are still relatively long. In fact, they'd be the longest odds of any Rookie of the Year favorite since at least 2006, the first year on record at SportsOddsHistory. Just think about that. Even in 2013 when Anthony Bennett was the No. 1 overall pick, the ROY front-runner had shorter odds than this year's favorite (Victor Oladipo at +300).\n\nThe 2024-25 award is shaping up to be the most wide open competition in that entire span, and probably before that time too. Just look at how little it took for Edey to move up from opening odds of +2500.\n\nReed Sheppard, who opened at +1100, is now second at +650. Sarr plummeted from +425 to +1000. No. 1 pick Zaccharie Risacher dropped too (+600 to +800). And this is all after just a few Summer League games.\n\nNine players have odds shorter than 20-1. That doesn't include Tidjane Salaun, who moved from +1000 to +3500, or Cody Williams, who moved from +1500 to +2000.\n\nIf nothing else, the unpredictability means there's money to be made on this race. But if you know who to bet on, please fill me in. I'd very much like a piece of that pot.\n\nThe Caitlin Clark effect is real\n\nIt's been fun to watch Caitlin Clark's growth as a professional the first two-plus months of her WNBA career, blossoming from a player who was trying to catch up to the speed of the game to a playmaking All-Star in what's basically been the blink of an eye.\n\nHowever, one thing that was never lacking as she entered the W was the attention that came from her record-breaking college career. Clark helped to bring new eyeballs to the league from the very start, and we've already seen that translate in record attendances and record television viewership.\n\nNow, we have another way to measure just how impactful the Caitlin Clark effect has been: betting.\n\n\"BetMGM has already taken as many bets for the first half of the 2024 season as we did for all of 2023,\" BetMGM senior sports trader Michael Ranftle said. \"Between more player prop offerings, the 'Caitlin Clark Effect' and the incredible rise in popularity of the WNBA, we're experiencing historic increases in betting on the WNBA.\"\n\nBetMGM has taken three times as many bets in the first half of the WNBA season as it did in the first half of 2023, and two times as many women have bet on the first half of the WNBA. Clark alone has almost five times more player prop bets than any other player in the first half of the season.\n\nOf course, she isn't the only one responsible for the league's growth. The W was already trending in a positive direction, and many of her fellow rookies also brought their own fanfare -- Angel Reese is second in player prop betting. But Clark is certainly the main catalyst, and with the fourth-best odds to win MVP, her rapidly improving game is only going to continue that trajectory in the second half.\n\nShootaround\n\n-- Nikola Jokic's new goatee has our Robert Zeglinski convinced he must be auditioning to be the next James Bond villain\n\n-- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope really said the Lakers had Denver's number in a series the Nuggets won\n\n-- Here's Paul George on constantly reminded the Clippers were Los Angeles' 'B Team'\n\n-- TNT is matching Amazon's contract with the NBA, and things might get messy", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prince_j_grimes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Prince J.

West Street. Emblazoned on the side of the massive glass hotel is a giant Gatorade ad featuring Indy's new favorite daughter, Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark.\n\nInside of the stadium, her fellow Iowa All-American, linebacker Jay Higgins, jokingly wonders what he has to do for his hometown to give him his own billboard. Or mural. Really any public piece of art would do.\n\n\"I'm 22, guys been here my whole life. I don't think no one's ever thought of putting a mirror of me anywhere, you know,\" Higgins joked, drawing laughs from reporters at Big Ten media days. \"I mean, at least artwork, a piece of canvas artwork would be fine, but she's got a whole wall.\"\n\nAll joking aside, Higgins is rooting for his fellow Hawkeyes standout through her first season with the Fever and understands the pandemonium around Clark given her incredible talent.\n\n\"What she's doing is special. If I could shoot the ball from half court, I'd probably get a mural, too,\" Higgins said. \"But the buzz that's going through the city, we value sports around here, and I feel like this was a great environment for her to come succeed in. It's cool to say, you know, the Indiana Fever, my hometown. So I'm repping the Fever. I'm repping Caitlin and Iowa.\n\n\"If I'm out in public and I got, like, a tigerhawk on, there's a high chance they're asking me if I know Caitlin Clark. And I keep it at that. I don't even tell them I'm an athlete. I just tell them I'm a normal student. You know, it's the Caitlin Clark show.\"\n\nIt took Clark a few weeks to adapt to the WNBA game, but she came on strong for the Fever going into her first All-Star weekend and the Olympic break. On the year, she's averaging 17.1 points and 8.2 assists, hitting double-doubles in seven of her past nine regular-season games including a record-breaking 19-assist game against the Dallas Wings on July 17.\n\nHiggins can fill the stat book, too. He recorded 171 total tackles for the Hawkeyes in '23 and returns for a fifth season with his eye on a trip to the new 12-team College Football Playoff, a reasonable goal if Iowa's offense can come close to reaching the productivity of its defense.\n\n\"Every win counts. And, you know, that's our goal,\" Higgins said, when asked about the Playoff. \"If we get to the end of the year and we won the games that we deserve to win, I think we can definitely be a part of those twelve teams. And it'd be cool to be a part of history.\"\n\nRelated: Iowa Football: 2024 Hawkeyes Season Preview and Prediction\n\nRelated: College Football 2024 All-America Team", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_lyons@postandcourier.com", "name": "Dan Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Indianapolis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Oil_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Oil Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marriott International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757556", "eventUri": "eng-9757556", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1995, "textEnd": 2002}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Kishan Reddy on Friday to make a representation in this regard.\n\nAddressing a press conference along with Agriculture Minister Tummala Nageswara Rao in Khammam, the Deputy CM said the state would seek allotment of new mines through nomination, not auction, as SCCL was a public sector company.\n\nThey said if Singareni was not allotted new coal mines, its very existence would be at stake.\n\nThe ministers urged Kishan Reddy, who hails from Telangana, to take the initiative in allotting mining blocks to SCCL. Vikramarka said the government, if necessary, would take an all-party delegation to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to request him to allot mining blocks to SCCL for its needs beyond 2030. He mentioned that currently coal is extracted from 40 mines in the state but 22 of these mines are nearing depletion. These mines are likely to close by 2030 and this will affect 42,000 direct employees and 26,000 outsourced workers of the SCCL.\n\nThe current coal production of 70 million tonnes is likely to drop to 15 million tonnes.\n\nThe ministers demanded that the Koyagudem coal block of Sattupalli that was auctioned recently should also be allotted to the SCCL.\n\nThey alleged that the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) had supported a bill brought by the BJP government in the Parliament to deprive the public sector companies of coal mines. The BRS MPs had supported an amendment made to the Mines and Minerals Act mandating the auctioning of coal mines and now the same party was opposing the auction. They said the then BRS government did not allow SCCL to participate in the auction and ensured that mining rights of the Koyagudem block were given to the companies whose leaders were closely associated with the party. Alleging that Singareni suffered losses during the BRS rule, they said the closure of old blocks and the non-allocation of new blocks resulted in a steep decline in the workforce.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallu_Bhatti_Vikramarka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singareni_Collieries_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singareni Collieries Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coal mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Kishan_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "G.

However, the Congress leaders are confident that they would be able to convince the Centre to allocate the coal block to Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL), instead of calling for the bids.\n\nAddressing the media in Khammam on Thursday, Deputy chief minister and energy minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said that he will meet Kishan Reddy to request him not to open auction Sravanapalli coal block.\n\nHe said that if possible, the State government was willing to take an all-party delegation to Delhi on the issue, to convince Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help SCCL get the coal block, as it has been in financial doldrums due to the policies of the previous BRS government.\n\n\"If the future of SCCL needs to be secured, the company needs to be allocated new coal blocks under its jurisdiction. As Kishan Reddy hails from this region, we have no second thoughts about asking him to protect the interests of SCCL,\" he said, adding that the State government would also request the Centre to allocate Sahtupalli and Koyagudem coal blocks to SCCL, as even after their open auction, mining works were yet to be taken up in those blocks.\n\nHe said that it was ironic to see BRS leaders demanding not to conduct open auction of Sravanapalli block in Mancherial district, as it was the BRS which had supported the NDA in 2015, when the latter had made amendments to the Mines and Minerals Act.\n\n\"The then BRS government had, on one hand taken the decision not to let SCCL participate in the auction of Sattupalli and Koyagudem blocks, and on the other, ensured that the company close to them won the bid. It is also surprising to know that the BRS government decided not to participate in the local auction, but to participate in the auction of coal blocks in Odisha in the past,\" he said.\n\nAdvising the BRS leaders not to spread false propaganda on SCCL, Bhatti said that it was during the BRS regime that SCCL was destroyed, its coal blocks were closed and no new blocks were allocated to the company.\n\nAssuring that the State government will do everything in its power to protect the interests of SCCL, Bhatti said that he has already met the former union minister of coal on this issue, and will speak with Kishan Reddy, and if necessary, will represent this issue to the prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, BRS working president KT Rama Rao (KTR) gave the issue an 'electoral turn' by saying that had the BRS won enough number of seats in the Lok Sabha elections, the party would have had a say in preventing such auction of coal blocks to private companies.\n\nAddressing media on Friday, he pointed-out that TDP with 16 MPs in the Lok Sabha, was able to prevent the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Had the BRS won so many seats, he said that his party would have played a decisive role at the Centre.\n\nAlso pointing-out that Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy had written a letter to the prime minister as the TPCC president in the past, urging the Centre not to auction coal blocks in the past, KTR wondered why the chief minister has said that he would attend the auction of Sravanapalli coal block now.\n\nRecalling how the Centre had allocated coal blocks directly to public sector undertakings in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu without conducting an open auction, KTR felt that a similar allocation could be done to SCCL without auctioning the Sravanapally coal block.\n\nThe Sravanapalli coal block is spread across 18.63 square kilometres, with 10.18 square kilometres of it called for auction. It has an estimated 119.9 million tonnes of coal reserves at a depth of about 420.5 metres.", "source": {"uri": "siasat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Siasat Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivek_bhoomi@siasat.com", "name": "Vivek Bhoomi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Kishan_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "G.

On behalf of the State government, the union Minister would be requested to allot the Sravanapalli coal block in Mancherial district, which goes for auctioning in a couple of months, to SCCL without auction.\n\nSpeaking to the media here, Bhatti Vikramarka said the union Minister would be asked to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appointment to consult him regarding the issue. An all-party delegation and all the stakeholders would request the Prime Minister to protect the interests of the SCCL. The State government was committed to protect the SCCL which employs 42,000 employees directly and 26,000 employees on an outsourcing basis while helping 50,000 to earn livelihood indirectly. The company was a lifeline for the State and coal was being produced through its 40 mines, he said.The company now produces 70 million tonnes of coal annually and it was estimated that by the year 2060 the coal production would come down to 17.28 million tonnes. In order to sustain the coal production capacity by 2030-32, the SCCL needs to explore new coal mines. If no new coal mines were acquired, the SCCL would become history, he said.\n\nThrough an amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957, the BJP-led Centre had in 2015 opened the way for auctioning of all coal mines and leasing them to private firms, Bhatti Vikramarka noted. In the auctions that followed, the Sathupalli-II and Koyagudem blocks were acquired by two separate private firms.

He found fault with the State government for opting to participate in the coal mine auctions instead of seeking direct allocation of coal mines to Singareni.\n\nThe Centre is auctioning more than 60 mines across the country, including coal blocks pertaining to Singareni, from Friday. The State government's participation in the auction contradicts their previous stance of opposing the auction and seeking direct allocation from the Centre to Singareni, Rama Rao said, pointing out several instances where coal mines were allocated without bidding to entities in other States, but not to Singareni.\n\nIn 2015, he said two mines in Odisha were given to Neyveli Lignite Corporation. Similarly, four coal mines were allocated to public sector companies in Gujarat without bidding. The BJP's Tamil Nadu president Annamalai had successfully lobbied to exclude coal mines in his State from auction, he said.\n\n\"But the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant's plea for the Bailadila coal mine in Chhattisgarh was ignored. Without a dedicated coal mine, the company was pushed into losses and attempts were made for its privatisation,\" he pointed out, cautioning that a similar strategy was being applied to Singareni, aiming to force the company into losses by denying it coal mine allocations, ultimately pushing it towards privatisation in the long run.\n\nThe BRS working president questioned the shifting stance of Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy, who as TPCC president had previously urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to auction the Singareni coal mines but was now suggesting the State's participation in the auction. \"While former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao resisted auctioning of Telangana's coal mines for 9.5 years to protect Singareni, Chief Minister Revanth Reddy seems to have joined hands with the BJP for its permanent closure,\" he said.\n\nCriticising union Mines Minister G Kishan Reddy, Rama Rao questioned whether the denial of direction coal mine allocations was a \"return gift\" from the BJP to the State which gave it eight MP seats recently. He demanded that all MPs including both the union Ministers from Telangana should immediately work together for cancellation of the Singareni mines auction.\n\nHe drew parallels with the TDP's success in preventing the privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, after winning 16 MP seats and safeguarding their State's interests. In contrast, he said the 16 elected MPs from Telangana, both from Congress and BJP, were remaining silent despite the Centre's attempt to harm the State's prospects through the mines auction.\n\n\"Former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has been proved right once again.

Rama Rao at a press conference in Telangana Bhavan, the party headquarters, here on Thursday.\n\nRao said \"if private companies take part in the auction then they should not blame us later as once we return to power, we will undo the auction.\"\n\nHe said \"as long as K. Chandrasekhar Rao was the Chief Minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy did not dare to auction coal blocks allotted to SCCL. Now the BJP and the Congress have joined hands to weaken Singareni by auctioning coal blocks and not giving the allotted mines to SCCL as was done with other public sector undertakings in other states like Gujarat, Odisha and Tamil Nadu.\"\n\nRao said \"this is why we said we need 16 of our voices in the Lok Sabha. People have given eight seats each to the BJP and Congress, whose representatives are not doing anything to stop the auction. We demand that the auctions be stopped and the coal blocks duly allotted to Singareni. N. Chandrababu with his 16 MPs in the Lok Sabha has stopped privatisation of the Vizag Steel Plant (VSP) in Andhra Pradesh.\"\n\nGoing further he said \"Knowing that the VSP playbook will be repeated here and despite the Centre placing a sword on our neck, KCR resisted coal block auctions for nine and a half years. VSP sought the Bailadila iron ore mines but that was given to a private company. Without its own captive mine, VSP went into losses because of which the Centre said that it must be sold. This is exactly what will happen to Singareni if coal block auctions take place.\"\n\nAfter KCR wrote to the Centre in 2021 saying that SCCL is a government-owned company and it must be given coal blocks without any auction, A. Revanth Reddy followed suit and opposed the auction.\n\n\"What has changed now? Why is the Chief Minister now saying SCCL will take part in the auctions?

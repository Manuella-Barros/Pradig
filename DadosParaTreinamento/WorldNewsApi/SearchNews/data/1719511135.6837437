The 30-year-old, a two-time PGA Tour winner and the world number 58, was found dead on Saturday, less than 24 hours after withdrawing from the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth Texas. Murray told his playing partners he was feeling unwell after 16 holes of Friday's second round and walked off the course. \"We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It\u2019s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It\u2019s a nightmare,\" Murray's parents said. \"We have so many questions that have no answers. But one. Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and \u2013 it seems \u2013 by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. \"We would like to thank the PGA TOUR and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now. \"Please respect our privacy as we work through this incredible tragedy, and please honor Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else. Thank you.\" There will be more to follow on this breaking news story and Mirror Sport will bring you the very latest updates, pictures and video as soon as possible.

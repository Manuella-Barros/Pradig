{"id": 243300348, "title": "Govt Likely to Allocate Special Funds for Implementation of the Three New Criminal Codes", "text": "The Narendra Modi government is likely to allocate a special fund or make budgetary provisions for the implementation of three new criminal codes \u2013 Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 and Bharatiya Sakhsya Abhiniyam 2023 \u2013 that will replace the colonial-era Indian Penal Code and related laws. The new legislations are scheduled to be implemented in phases starting July 1. In response to a communication from the central government seeking inputs and proposals on the new laws, states have submitted their budgetary requirements to the Ministry of Home Affairs, News18 has learnt. The communication from the central government to the states was sent in March after which the states evaluated the existing mechanism, the units and other required infrastructure needed to implement the new criminal code. The training for the investigating officers across agencies and police organisations in the state has been going on, while the training of senior officers in police and judiciary is also continuing. The central government also set up training modules for the new laws, different sections, forensic requirements and the investigation procedures. Re-Structuring the Criminal Justice System Speaking to News18, a top police officer of a state said: \u201cWe have sent proposals to the government mentioning the budgetary requirements. While training of the officers and security personnel is on, there are multiple infrastructural needs. It is a complete overhaul of the old system, and it will need time, training and funds to change the age-old system.\u201d The state and central police organisations need to rework the existing mechanisms, and requirements for new infrastructure are huge. From buying adequate numbers of video cameras to rebuilding evidence storage facilities and restructuring forensic laboratories, hiring forensic scientists and so on \u2014 it will take time to get the adequate infrastructure in place. \u201cTo comply with the new rules and legal provisions, state and central police organisations have submitted their proposals and budgetary requirements. The government will decide on the proposals and how the budgetary provisions would be made for that,\u201d said a senior IPS officer serving at the Centre. \u201cThis is a mammoth exercise and it will take time to be fully implemented across states. About the funds the states are asking for, the central government will take a call on that. We are expecting some budgetary provisions or some announcements related to this soon,\u201d he added.", "summary": "In response to a communication from the central government seeking inputs and proposals on the new laws, states have submitted their budgetary requirements to the Ministry of Home Affairs, News18 has learnt", "url": "https://www.news18.com/india/govt-likely-to-allocate-special-funds-for-implementation-of-the-three-new-criminal-codes-8948410.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/06/police-2024-06-1a3622e3ed0e984c4f06537d1afe43c2-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:04:36", "author": "Madhuparna Das,News18,Nitya Thirumalai", "authors": ["Madhuparna Das", "News18", "Nitya Thirumalai"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.121}

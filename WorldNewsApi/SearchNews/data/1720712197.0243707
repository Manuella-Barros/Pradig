{"id": 231974110, "title": "Why American fathers need to reject '3 damaging lies' in today's culture, says pastor", "text": "Ahead of Father's Day on June 16, a faith leader on the West Coast shared \"three damaging lies\" he believes American dads are being told, either directly or indirectly, in today's culture \u2013 and why fathers need to reject these untruths in order to do the best job possible in raising their children. \"Many dads are hardworking, fun, kind and intelligent,\" said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church in Auburn, Washington. Yet some of the \"damaging lies\" that are circulating today about fatherhood, he said, \"are deceptive and difficult to identify. They are sneaky, strong and simple.\" FATHER'S DAY 2024: AMAZON GIFT IDEAS FOR THE ADVENTURE-SEEKING DAD Once unearthed, though, \"they can be thrown away,\" Bradley said. He told Fox News Digital, \"Replacing lies with truth is powerful.\" With faith in God, \"dads can be set free from the mental traps that all too easily can entangle people.\" With just a week to go before Father's Day, he shared three lies that he believes \"need to be removed from the souls of fathers\" in order for dads to be the best parents they possibly can be for the well-being of their children. Lie No. 1: 'You can't be a good dad' Bradley said a \"false message of defeat can be debilitating\" for fathers. \"It echoes with every failure and mistake\u2026 It is too heavy a burden\" to carry. \"Your past experiences in life don't define you.\" Men who had dads who were \"absent, abusive or aloof,\" he said, may still carry scars from those experiences and perhaps are \"unintentionally living them out in their own lives.\" Bradley, himself a husband and father of four children, said, \"God is a healer and close to the brokenhearted. God is a Father to the fatherless. You have a heavenly Father who is always faithful and good \u2013 so receive His love that endures forever.\" \u2018JESUS IS HERE\u2019: THOUSANDS JOIN EUCHARISTIC PROCESSION IN WASHINGTON, DC For fathers who may be struggling in their roles, he said, \"God will bring other men into your life whom you can learn from and who will fill some of the \u2018dad void\u2019 you may have endured. Your past experiences in life don't define you.\" So, \"let the negative pieces motivate you to become very different,\" he advised. \"Your story is not over. The truth is, you can be the dad you never had.\" Lie No. 2: 'It's fine to be an independent dad' Many men today are tempted or encouraged to \"go solo \u2013 which initially can seem appealing,\" said Bradley. \"Relationships may be messy at times \u2014 but they're worth the investment.\" In a chaotic culture, \"independence appears to be less complicated and includes less drama. Retreating to the \u2018man cave\u2019 can give some desired shelter from the storm,\" he said. The Christian pastor said the problem with this thinking is that \"we are not made for isolation. We all need God and other people.\" The lie here, he said, \"is that we're self-sufficient and that we can control our lives better if no one is near us or around us. We indulge in entertainment and hobbies as a refuge. Or work becomes our escape. Life becomes shallow.\" In his view, it's \"common in a fast-paced and challenging culture to wander from God, drift from your spouse, have too much distance from your children \u2013 and not have many close friends.\" 15 FATHER'S DAY GIFTS FOR DADS WHO HAVE EVERYTHING Said Bradley, \"No dad wants the legacy of being distant. Relationships may be messy at times \u2013 but they're worth the investment.\" He added, \"Connecting with family bears much fruit.\" Lie No. 3: \u2018Being a father is not that important\u2019 While many other people \"can accomplish your job at work, replace you on your weekend men's league team or serve where you volunteer, you are the only person in the world who is the father of your children,\" said Bradley, addressing dads directly. That special role, he said, \"should be cherished and be very high up\" on the priority list.

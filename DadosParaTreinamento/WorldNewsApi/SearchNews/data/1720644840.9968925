A powerful video was shown echoing the theme, awaken new depths, warning of immediate protection needs and cautioning that there is no time for an \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d sense of complacency. In a statement marking the Day \u2013 which falls officially on Saturday \u2013 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the ocean sustains life on Earth and the problems are essentially man-made. \u201cClimate change is triggering rising seas and threatening the very existence of small island developing states and coastal populations\u201d, he said. Mr. Guterres also mentioned that ocean acidification is destroying coral reefs, with sea temperatures reaching record levels leading to extreme weather events. Overfishing and other factors are contributing to the destruction of the world\u2019s marine ecosystems. The President of the General Assembly, Dennis Francis, attended the event and voiced similar concerns about the current state of the ocean. \u201cThere is so much still to learn about oceans \u2013 and, importantly, to reverse the damage being caused to our precious lifeline resource.\u201d Mr. Francis said that the ocean is our strongest ally against climate change and therefore \u201cit is our joint responsibility to course correct \u2013 and recommit to sustainably manage the ocean\u2019s precious resources \u2013 so as to ensure their availability intergenerationally.\u201d The Secretary-General and General Assembly President said they are expecting reflections on and actions toward ways to restore and protect our oceans as the Summit of the Future in September 2024 and next year\u2019s UN Oceans Conference approach. State of the Ocean Report The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) released a State of the Ocean report earlier in the week pushing policymakers to think about \u201cthe ocean we need for the future we want.\u201d The report detailed threats to the ocean and trends that could help identify drivers of change. It warned that the rate of ocean warming has doubled in 20 years and that coastal species are suffocating due to decreased oxygen levels in the ocean, among other things. One of its conclusions is that \u201cocean literacy practice and research is a strategic ally to optimize resources, accelerate behavioural change and improve the implementation of ocean conservation programmes and sustainability practices.\u201d Soundcloud https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1297186681&visual=&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&color=%23ff5500 Calls to action Speakers at UN Headquarters on Friday included marine biologist and oceanographer Sylvia Earle, who said finding ways to share the importance of protecting our ocean with the world can lead to vital action to also preserve coastal wildlife. \u201cNow is the time for governments, businesses, investors, scientists and communities to come together in defence of our ocean,\u201d UN Secretary-General Guterres said. In a similar call to action, General Assembly President Francis said we should \u201credouble our efforts to support and advance ocean action, build much-needed capacity in [small island developing states]and other developing countries \u2013 and promote innovative financing solutions that drive transformation and scale up resilience.\u201d", "summary": "UN World Oceans Day, celebrated on Friday at UN Headquarters in New York, focused on \u201copening minds, igniting senses, and inspiring possibilities\u201d to protect marine life worldwide.", "url": "https://europeantimes.news/2024/06/world-oceans-day-protection-are-needed/", "image": "https://europeantimes.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/European-Pariliament-1-2.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:45:18", "author": "United Nations News", "authors": ["United Nations News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "es", "sentiment": 0.177}

The suit, filed by BSV Claims, accuses the exchanges of anti-competitive behaviour in delisting BSV in 2019.

This certification would mark the initial step in the lawsuit.\n\nBinance has requested the CAT to dismiss the part of the case concerning BSV's alleged potential to become a major cryptocurrency, which pertains to those who retained BSV after its delisting.

The case is filed against several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, and ShapeShift. The hearing, which began on June 5 under sunny skies in London, revolves around the 2019 delisting of Bitcoin SV (BSV).\n\nThe BSV delisting followed controversial claims by Craig Steven Wright asserting that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC). Moreover, BSV Claims Ltd. is demanding a staggering $9 billion in compensation on behalf of BSV holders.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the delisting deprived Bitcoin SV investors of significant growth opportunities. In addition, the company alleges that the exchanges' actions constituted collusion and unfairly influenced the market. This eventually resulted in substantial financial losses for BSV investors.\n\nAccording to BSV Claims Ltd., the losses were calculated based on the performance of other cryptocurrencies between 2019 and 2024. Additionally, they suggested that BSV holders missed out on substantial gains they might have realized had BSV not been delisted.\n\nThe defendants, comprising Bittylicious Limited, Payward Limited (parent company of Kraken), ShapeShift Global Limited, Payward, Inc., ShapeShift AG, and Binance Europe Services Limited, have assembled formidable legal teams to contest the claims. They argue that BSV investors had ample opportunity to sell their tokens following the delisting announcements.\n\nFurthermore, they argued that they could have reinvested in other cryptocurrencies, thereby mitigating any potential losses. In association, the defendants assert that BSV holders were not subject to any lock-ups that would have prevented them from selling their holdings. Therefore, should not be entitled to compensation for purported lost opportunities.\n\nCentral to BSV Claims Ltd.'s argument are the announcements made on social media, particularly Twitter (now X). They asserted that these posts indicated a coordinated effort among the exchanges to delist BSV.

The lawsuit claims Binance and other exchanges colluded to \"delist\" the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) cryptocurrency. This case is being heard at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) and involves over 200,000 BSV owners.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by BSV Claims, alleges that Binance, Kraken, and other exchanges engaged in anti-competitive behavior by delisting BSV in 2019. Lawyers for BSV Claims argue that this delisting caused BSV's value to drop significantly. They also claim it prevented BSV from becoming a \"top-tier\" cryptocurrency, valuing this aspect of the claim at up to \u00a39 billion.\n\nThe exchanges do not oppose the case's certification under the UK's collective proceedings regime, similar to the U.S. class action system. Certification would be the first step in the lawsuit. Binance, however, has requested the CAT to dismiss the part of the case concerning BSV's alleged potential to become a significant cryptocurrency. This part of the case is for those who retained BSV after delisting it.\n\nBinance's lawyer, Brian Kennelly, argued that those who kept BSV made \"an entirely voluntary decision.\" He said they \"could reasonably have sold it and reinvested it in comparable cryptocurrency.\" Kennelly further contended that this part of the lawsuit should not proceed.\n\nBSV Claims' lawyers, however, maintain that the issue should be tried in the same way as the rest of the case. They argue that the delisting was an anti-competitive behavior that affected the cryptocurrency's market position and value.\n\nA spokesperson for Binance declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. Meanwhile, a representative for Kraken described the lawsuit as \"baseless.\" The exchanges, including Binance and Kraken, removed BSV from their platforms in 2019. This decision was partly due to claims made by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright. Wright asserted that he was the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, known as \"Satoshi Nakamoto.\"\n\nEarlier this year, in separate litigation, Wright was found to have lied and forged documents to support his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright has indicated that he will appeal against that ruling. This context adds complexity to the ongoing lawsuit involving BSV's delisting.\n\nThe lawsuit's outcome could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market.

The lawsuit was filed by BSV Claims Ltd against six companies: Bittylicious Limited, Payward Limited, ShapeShift Global Limited, Payward, Inc, ShapeShift AG, and Binance Europe Services Limited.

Access COINTURK FINANCE to get the latest financial and business news.\n\nThe main issue of the trial is the decision by the defendant companies to delist BSV from cryptocurrency exchanges. BSV Claims Ltd argues that this action harmed investors holding BSV by preventing them from benefiting from potential increases in the cryptocurrency's value. The plaintiffs claim that the delisting deprived BSV investors of market growth opportunities and led to significant financial losses.\n\nThe Outcome of the Trial Could Set a Precedent\n\nBittylicious, Payward, ShapeShift, and Binance are some of the most significant names in the cryptocurrency exchange sector, and their collective decision to delist BSV had substantial market impacts. The outcome of this trial could set a precedent for how similar disputes are handled in the future, particularly regarding the responsibilities of exchanges towards the cryptocurrencies they list and the investors trading on their platforms.\n\nThe legal teams representing the defendants are expected to argue that the decision to delist BSV was made in accordance with their policies and in the best interest of their platforms and users.

The legal challenge arises from the exchanges' decision to delist Bitcoin SV (BSV) in 2019. The delisting followed controversial claims by Craig Steven Wright (CSW) that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nBSV Claims Ltd argues that the delisting of BSV was based on fraudulent claims and collusion among the exchanges, which severely impacted the value and liquidity of BSV. According to BSV Claims Ltd, the exchanges' actions were not only unfounded but also violated competition law. They specified the violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Section 2 of the UK's Competition Act 1998.\n\nMoreover, the case revolves around a series of tweets between April 12 and April 19, 2019. These posts are referred to as the \"Collusive Tweets,\" where various crypto exchanges, including Binance and Kraken, disclosed their intentions to delist BSV.\n\nThis culminated in the delisting events from April 15 to June 5, 2019, where these Binance and Kraken followed through on their announcements. Furthermore, BSV Claims Ltd alleges that these actions constituted an anticompetitive agreement aimed at distorting competition in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRobert Buckland MP, who is standing in the upcoming UK general election for Swindon South against Labour's Heidi Alexander, has been drawn into the controversy due to his advisory role with BSV Claims Ltd. Buckland, who receives \u00a35,000 per quarter for advising the company for six hours per month, has faced criticism from BitMEX Research. In a post on X, BitMEX spotlighted his involvement in what they described as a \"frivolous\" case.\n\nAlso Read: PEPE Price Soars As Fresh Wallet Scoops 202 Bln Coins From Binance, More Gains Ahead?\n\nMoreover, Justice Mellor's recent ruling found that Wright's claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto were built on fraudulent documents, adding a significant dimension to the current legal proceedings. Hence, the hearing will delve into whether the exchanges' decisions to delist BSV were influenced by these false claims and whether they acted in concert to harm BSV's market position.\n\nBSV Claims Ltd maintains that the value of blockchain technology underpinning BSV and other cryptocurrencies is substantial. They emphasized the offering innovations such as smart contracts and secure record-keeping. Moreover, the delisting, they argue, unfairly undermined this potential by damaging BSV's market standing.\n\nWright has long portrayed himself as a polymath, claiming to have authored the Bitcoin White Paper and developed the first version of the Bitcoin Source Code. However, the court found that Wright extensively lied and fabricated documents to support his Satoshi Nakamoto claim.\n\nThe recent judgment highlights Wright's deceit, revealing that he mixed partial truths with lies. In addition, it spotlighted the often use of complex jargon to confuse issues. When confronted with evidence against his claims, Wright resorted to further lies and evasions, blaming others.\n\nNotably, the court identified specific instances of his dishonesty. These include the false testimony about Mr. Matthews receiving the Bitcoin White Paper in 2008. Moreover, Wright's fabrications were found to be clumsy and easily detectable, leading the court to conclude that his attempts to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto were fraudulent.\n\nIn addition, his misconduct has spanned multiple jurisdictions, including the UK and Norway, and previous cases like the Kleiman litigation. The judgment details Wright's systematic efforts to deceive the court, marking a severe abuse of the legal process.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"},

BitMEX Research reported that six companies related to the four exchanges appeared with legal teams before the tribunal today.\n\nBinance asked the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal during a hearing to dismiss the part of the case claiming that BSV had the potential to become a major crypto.\n\nBinance lawyer Brian Kennelly said that investors who held BSV during the delisting did so voluntarily and could have exchanged it for another asset.\n\nBinance and other companies do not oppose certification of the case under the UK's collective proceedings regime, which will bring the case to trial.\n\nBinance's attempted dismissal concerns most of the value sought by plaintiff BSV Claims Ltd -- 9 billion of 10 billion GBP, or $11.5 billion of $12.8 billion.\n\nThe plaintiff's original statement alleges that exchanges deliberately colluded to damage BSV's prospects and delist the asset, including by communicating publicly on Twitter, now X.\n\nThe exchanges' actions supposedly caused the value of BSV to drop and gave investors no meaningful opportunity to withdraw.

Now, they're being sued for $13bn", "body": "Bitcoin SV was pulled from both exchanges in 2019 after Dr Craig Wright claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. Now, a class action alleges that caused the coin's investors big losses.\n\nFresh from a damning ruling that Craig Wright \"extensively and repeatedly\" lied about being Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, another crypto showdown is now unfolding in British courts.\n\nThe case currently being heard by the Competition Appeals Tribunal in London relates to Bitcoin Satoshi Vision -- Bitcoin SV for short -- which was created back in 2018 following a hard fork from another cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin Cash.\n\nDr Wright has long been a vocal backer of BSV -- even going so far as to claim it's the real Bitcoin -- and argues this digital asset, which has a considerably larger block size, paves the way for cheaper and faster transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThat background brings us back to the class action lawsuit being heard by the tribunal. A group known as BSV Claims Limited is suing four prominent crypto exchanges -- Binance, Kraken, Bittylicious and ShapeShift -- and demanding up to \u00a310 billion ($12.8 billion) in damages.\n\nWhy? Because it's alleged that these trading platforms had colluded to delist BSV back in April 2019. Lawyers representing the class claim that this artificially drove down the coin's price and caused financial harm to British consumers who had invested in it.\n\nIt's especially interesting to look at who's leading BSV Claims Limited. Lord David Currie of Marylebone has held a number of influential roles in Britain during his career -- serving as chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, as well as the very first chairman of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom.\n\nThe organization goes on to say that it's backed by a number of other prominent politicians. They include Lord Andrew Tyrie, a trained economist who was a Member of Parliament for 20 years and a former chairman of the Treasury Select Committee. A current MP, Sir Robert Buckland, is also on the advisory board. He used to be the justice secretary.\n\nAccording to BSV Claims Limited, the decision to delist BSV was \"an anti-competitive practice in violation of competition law.\" Their lawsuit is said to represent an estimated 244,000 Britons who owned the cryptocurrency and is on an \"opt out\" basis, meaning all investors would be deemed as eligible for damages unless they explicitly say they're not interested.\n\nThe case is being funded by a company called Softwhale Limited, which would receive a share of any damages if the class action is successful. Little is known about the business -- but according to Bloomberg, this firm's funding comes from Calvin Ayre. He's a Canadian entrepreneur and one-time gambling tycoon who has also thrown his support behind BSV.\n\nOne plank of the evidence put forward by BSV Claims Limited relates to tweets sent around the time of this cryptocurrency being delisted. Five years ago, a pseudonymous Bitcoiner called Hodlonaut had brandished Wright as a \"fraud\" and a \"scammer\" on Twitter. (A defamation lawsuit soon followed, which Hodlonaut went on to win.) Changpeng Zhao, Binance's then-CEO, had tweeted in support of Hodlonaut -- writing in April 2019:\n\nJust three days later, CZ followed through on this threat -- with the exchange announcing that all BSV trading pairs were to be listed. At the time, Binance had argued:\n\n\"We periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect.\"\n\nNews of the delisting by the world's largest exchange sent BSV's value plummeting -- leading to a precipitous fall of 50% within two days. And whereas the cryptocurrency was once the 12th biggest in terms of market capitalization in 2019, it's now 75th, with prices stagnating as other major altcoins enjoy a bull market.\n\nFor its part, Binance told the London tribunal on Wednesday that a large chunk of the case -- relating to whether BSV had the potential to become a major cryptocurrency -- should be thrown out. The exchange's lawyer, Brian Kennelly, said those who continued to hold onto this altcoin made \"an entirely voluntary decision\" and were free to invest in an alternative.\n\nMeanwhile, Kraken has previously described this lawsuit as \"baseless.\"\n\nThe current three-day hearing relates to BSV Claims Limited's attempt to get their class action certified with a collective proceedings order, meaning the case remains at a very early stage. If granted, it would then advance to a trial -- with the organization itself admitting it could take two to three years before any decision is made on damages.", "source": {"uri": "crypto.news",

The rest -- more than 180 companies -- did not respond to emails over several days.\n\nSo here's what we know: Out of the 17 corporate spokespeople who replied to CNBC, four said their CEOs planned to attend: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and the CEO of Edison International, Pedro Pizarro.\n\nAnother 13 of them said their CEOs will not be going to see Trump and Zients speak.\n\nBlackstone CEO and Trump ally Steve Schwarzman, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, Steelcase CEO Sara Armbruster, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, Delta CEO Ed Bastian, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and the company's executive chairman James Gorman, and Lynn Good, the CEO of Duke Energy, are among those who will be absent from the conference, according to their company representatives.\n\nSome of these, such as Armbruster, Good and Solomon, are not attending due to scheduling conflicts and travel. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, for instance, will reportedly be at the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nRepresentatives for Woods and Bastian did not reply to questions about why their chief executives aren't attending the meeting. Representatives for Fink and Nadella did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe meeting's attendee list could read like a roster of which CEOs are willing to head to Washington to hear Trump -- and which are not -- just weeks after his conviction in New York on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nTrump's comments to the group could also offer a split-screen comparison to what Biden said in his speech to the CEOs at a March 2022 Business Roundtable meeting he attended.\n\nAs the president campaigns for reelection, Biden is running on his administration's record of aggressive antitrust enforcement and blanket bans on so-called \"junk fees\" that companies charge for services that don't cost the company anything.\n\nThese policies have drawn the ire of some business leaders, and left them rooting for a second Trump administration and the regulatory easing up it could bring.\n\nBehind closed doors, however, Biden has made his own efforts to court corporate America. The president has regularly met with CEOs and industry executives to discuss the U.S. economy's post-pandemic recovery and global standing.\n\nRepublican former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Calif., said the willingness of busy CEOs to schlep to Washington for face time with Trump was a function of the tight presidential race.\n\n\"I think [CEOs] see what everybody else sees, that he's going to win,\" McCarthy said Wednesday on CNBC's Squawk Box.\n\nFor some of the CEOs planning to attend Thursday, the choice to be there represents a shift in their attitude towards the former president. Following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, several top executives broke sharply with Trump, either publicly or privately.\n\nLast year, Dimon told attendees at the New York Times' DealBook conference that they should \"help\" Trump's rival, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, win her primary fight against Trump.\n\nIf Haley were to do well, he said, voters might have \"a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\" The former president responded by ripping Dimon on social media, calling him an \"overrated globalist.\"\n\nBut just two months later, Dimon had changed his tune.\n\n\"Take a step back, be honest. [Trump] was kind of right about NATO, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Trade tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nTrump has sketched out a second-term economic agenda that many economists believe could reheat inflation, a dreaded prospect for investors and consumers who have spent the past year eagerly waiting for the Federal Reserve to respond to cooling inflation by cutting interest rates.\n\nThe former president has also proposed extending his first-term tax cuts past their 2025 expiration date, and imposing draconian tariffs on imports across the board, especially those coming from China.\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Dimon implied that his willingness to defend some of Trump's policies was at least partly in order to avoid a scenario where either he, or JPMorgan Chase, ends up on the bad side of a notoriously vengeful Trump.\n\n\"I have to be prepared for both [Trump and Biden to win]\" he said. \"I will be prepared for both. We will deal with both.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_picciotto@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Rebecca Picciotto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brian_schwartz@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Brian Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moynihan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Moynihan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fraser_(executive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fraser (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Edison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bastian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Bastian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Solomon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David M.

Ambassador Nikki Haley, win her primary fight against Trump.\n\nIf Haley succeeds, Dimon said, voters could have \"a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump's.\" The former president responded by ripping Dimon on social media, calling him an \"overrated globalist.\"\n\nBut just two months later, Dimon had changed his mind.\n\n\"Take a step back, be honest. [Trump] I was mostly right about NATO, and mostly right about immigration. It has developed the economy quite well. The commercial tax reform worked. He was right about part of China,\" Dimon said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nTrump has outlined a second-term economic agenda that many economists say could heat up inflation, a dreaded prospect for investors and consumers who have spent the last year anxiously waiting for the Federal Reserve to respond to the slowdown inflation by reducing interest rates.\n\nThe former president also proposed extending his first term's tax cuts beyond their 2025 expiration date and imposing draconian tariffs on all imports, particularly those from China .\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Dimon suggested that his willingness to defend some of Trump's policies was, at least in part, aimed at avoiding a scenario in which he or JPMorgan Chase found themselves on the wrong side of a notoriously vengeful Trump.\n\n\"I must be prepared for both [Trump and Biden to win]\", he said. \"I'll be ready for both. We will deal with both. \"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moynihan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Moynihan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Bastian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Bastian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Solomon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David M.

Trump emphasized tax cuts and deregulation, while Biden showcased economic improvements under his administration. Both candidates are focused on swaying influential corporate CEOs.\n\nU.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Jeff Zients, U.S. President Joe Biden's White House chief of staff, on Thursday met with top American business leaders in Washington as they seek to curry favor with corporate America months ahead of elections, two sources said. Trump was interviewed by conservative commentator Larry Kudlow, who served as a key economic adviser during Trump's 2017 to 2021 term, the sources said. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Xerox CEO Steven Bandrowczak, Gap Inc President Richard Dickson, and Truist CEO Bill Rogers were seen leaving the building after the meeting.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook was seen sitting in the front row, Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore said. The Trump meeting with the Business Roundtable, which counts over 200 CEOs as members, focused on the economy. Moore said the former president \"had a very pro-business message\" that emphasized tax cuts for businesses and reducing regulation.\n\nThe dualing Thursday pitches show both candidates are increasingly focused on wooing deep pocketed and powerful corporate CEOs as the election draws near. In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, 44% of registered voters said they believed Trump had a better plan for the economy compared with 33% in support of Biden's economic strategy. The Biden campaign's message was clear Thursday morning: In a statement showcasing economic improvements under the Democratic president, the campaign criticized Trump's economic proposals, and his past.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES, TAXES Biden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the Nov. 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.\n\nBiden has made protecting the environment a core part of his economic plans. His administration has created a series of incentives for the purchase and use of electric vehicles, and in January his administration paused approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas from new projects. Trump, while at times light on specifics, has attacked measures meant to hasten the transition of the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels and has repeatedly claimed that electric vehicles do not work.\n\nTrump \"said one of his first priorities when he is back in office he will be to unleash American energy,\" Moore said, adding that \"We are playing into the hands of China, Russia and OPEC by not producing more.\" While in office, Trump cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, cuts that Moore said Trump would seek to make permanent. Biden has proposed increasing the top rate for large corporations to 28%, below historic levels, but above the current figure.\n\nBUSINESS TITANS RETURN TO TRUMP Both men have broadly used tariffs to protect U.S. industry. Trump has proposed putting a 10% duty on all imports.\n\n\"President Trump's America First economic program will deliver middle class tax cuts, record-setting regulation cuts, fair trade, abundant energy, low inflation, better wages and a restoration of the rule of law in America,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. While in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the U.S. Capitol.

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Xerox CEO Steven Bandrowczak, Gap Inc President Richard Dickson, and Truist CEO Bill Rogers were seen leaving the building after the meeting.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook was seen sitting in the front row, Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore said.\n\nThe Trump meeting with the Business Roundtable, which counts over 200 CEOs as members, focused on the economy. Moore said the former president \"had a very pro-business message\" that emphasized tax cuts for businesses and reducing regulation.\n\nThe dualing Thursday pitches show both candidates are increasingly focused on wooing deep pocketed and powerful corporate CEOs as the election draws near. In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, 44% of registered voters said they believed Trump had a better plan for the economy compared with 33% in support of Biden's economic strategy.\n\nThe Biden campaign's message was clear Thursday morning: In a statement showcasing economic improvements under the Democratic president, the campaign criticized Trump's economic proposals, and his past.\n\nBiden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the November 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.\n\nBiden has made protecting the environment a core part of his economic plans. His administration has created a series of incentives for the purchase and use of electric vehicles, and in January his administration paused approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas from new projects.\n\nTrump, while at times light on specifics, has attacked measures meant to hasten the transition of the US economy away from fossil fuels and has repeatedly claimed that electric vehicles do not work.\n\nTrump \"said one of his first priorities when he is back in office he will be to unleash American energy,\" Moore said, adding that \"We are playing into the hands of China, Russia and OPEC by not producing more.\"\n\nWhile in office, Trump cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, cuts that Moore said Trump would seek to make permanent. Biden has proposed increasing the top rate for large corporations to 28%, below historic levels, but above the current figure.\n\nAlso Read: | President Joe Biden faces first lawsuit over new asylum crackdown at the border\n\nBusiness titans return to Trump\n\nBoth men have broadly used tariffs to protect US industry. Trump has proposed putting a 10% duty on all imports.\n\n\"President Trump's America First economic program will deliver middle class tax cuts, record-setting regulation cuts, fair trade, abundant energy, low inflation, better wages and a restoration of the rule of law in America,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.\n\nWhile in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the US Capitol. Those meetings are expected to focus on the policy priorities of a potential second Trump term.\n\nThe Business Roundtable routinely asks major party presidential candidates to address the group during election years.

Trump discussed economic policies in meetings with conservative commentator Larry Kudlow and Business Roundtable members. Their discussions highlighted contrasting economic visions between Trump and Biden.\n\nU.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Jeff Zients, U.S. President Joe Biden's White House chief of staff, on Thursday met with top American business leaders in Washington as they seek to curry favor with corporate America months ahead of elections, two sources said. Trump was interviewed by conservative commentator Larry Kudlow, who served as a key economic adviser during Trump's 2017 to 2021 term, the sources said. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was seen leaving the building after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting with the Business Roundtable, which counts 200 CEOs as members, focused on the economy, other sources said before it started. But the dualing Thursday pitches show both candidates are increasingly focused on wooing deep pocketed and powerful corporate CEOs as the election draws near. In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, 44% of registered voters said they believed Trump had a better plan for the economy compared with 33% in support of Biden's economic strategy.\n\nThe Biden campaign's message was clear Thursday morning: In a statement showcasing economic improvements under the Democratic president, the campaign criticized Trump's economic proposals, and his past. \"Donald Trump couldn't run a lemonade stand, let alone our country. He is a fraud, a crook, and a failed businessman and president who left America in economic ruin,\" campaign spokesperson James Singer said before the meeting.\n\nTrump economic adviser Stephen Moore said after the meeting the former president \"had a very pro-business message\" that emphasized tax cuts for businesses and reducing regulation. ELECTRIC VEHICLES, TAXES\n\nBiden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the Nov. 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.

Biden is in Italy for a G7 summit, where he is slated to sign a new security agreement with Ukraine.\n\nWhile in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the U.S. Capitol. Those meetings are expected to focus on the policy priorities of a potential second Trump term. The Business Roundtable routinely asks major party presidential candidates to address the group during election years. Even so, Trump's appearance underlines how some in the business community have warmed to the former president after many companies distanced themselves from him and his supporters following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the weeks after the attack, many major corporations said they would no longer donate to federal politicians who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 vote, which Biden won, though many have since appeared to quietly walk back that pledge. Business titans like Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, have previously forsaken Trump, only to announce in this election cycle that they would support him after he easily dispatched his rivals in the Republican presidential nominating contest earlier this year.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was seen leaving the building after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting with the Business Roundtable, which counts 200 CEOs as members, focused on the economy, other sources said before it started.\n\nBut the dualing Thursday pitches show both candidates are increasingly focused on wooing deep pocketed and powerful corporate CEOs as the election draws near. In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, 44% of registered voters said they believed Trump had a better plan for the economy compared with 33% in support of Biden's economic strategy.\n\nThe Biden campaign's message was clear Thursday morning: In a statement showcasing economic improvements under the Democratic president, the campaign criticized Trump's economic proposals, and his past.\n\n\"Donald Trump couldn\u00b4t run a lemonade stand, let alone our country. He is a fraud, a crook, and a failed businessman and president who left America in economic ruin,\" campaign spokesperson James Singer said before the meeting.\n\nTrump economic adviser Stephen Moore said after the meeting the former president \"had a very pro-business message\" that emphasized tax cuts for businesses and reducing regulation.\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLES, TAXES\n\nBiden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the Nov. 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.\n\nBiden has made protecting the environment a core part of his economic plans. His administration has created a series of incentives for the purchase and use of electric vehicles, and in January his administration paused approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas from new projects.\n\nTrump, while at times light on specifics, has attacked measures meant to hasten the transition of the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels and has repeatedly claimed that electric vehicles do not work.\n\nWhile in office, Trump cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Biden has proposed increasing the top rate for large corporations to 28%, below historic levels, but above the current figure.\n\nBUSINESS TITANS RETURN TO TRUMP\n\nBoth men have broadly used tariffs to protect U.S. industry. Trump has proposed putting a 10% duty on all imports.\n\n\"President Trump's America First economic program will deliver middle class tax cuts, record-setting regulation cuts, fair trade, abundant energy, low inflation, better wages and a restoration of the rule of law in America,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.\n\nWhile in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the U.S. Capitol. Those meetings are expected to focus on the policy priorities of a potential second Trump term.\n\nThe Business Roundtable routinely asks major party presidential candidates to address the group during election years.

Trump then told the CEOs a story about how excited tipped workers were about his proposal, prompting laughter from the corporate leaders, according to multiple sources.\n\nTrump spoke for about an hour at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting.

During the riot on Jan. 6, 2021 on Capitol Hill, executives, including members of the Business Roundtable, called on Trump to stop the violence.\n\nTrump also took a dig at Biden. \"We need a president who is at the top of his game and let's face it, this president is not at the top of his game.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Cook declined to comment on whether he attended the meeting.\n\nTrump told a meeting full of House Republicans earlier in the day about the idea of imposing an \"all tariff policy\" that would ultimately enable the U.S. to get rid of the income tax.", "source": {"uri":

The association of more than 200 CEOs will also host Jeff Zients, Biden's White House chief of staff, earlier in the morning, those people said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, meanwhile, will address the Economic Club of New York at 12:30 p.m., where she will discuss \"expanding the U.S. economy's productive capacity,\" according to a Treasury Department statement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what message Trump or Zients planned to deliver to the Business Roundtable, which counts Wall Street heavyweights including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman as members.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser are among those attending, according to three sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nConservative commentator Larry Kudlow, who served as a key economic adviser during Trump's 2017 to 2021 term, will interview the former president during the event, one of the people said.\n\nBiden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the Nov. 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.\n\nBiden has made protecting the environment a core part of his economic plans. His administration has, for instance, created a series of incentives for the purchase and use of electric vehicles, and in January his administration paused approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas from new projects.\n\nTrump, while at times light on specifics, has attacked measures meant to hasten the transition of the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels and has repeatedly claimed that electric vehicles do not work.\n\nWhile in office, Trump cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Biden has proposed increasing the top rate for large corporations to 28%, below historic levels, but above the current figure.\n\nBUSINESS TITANS RETURN TO TRUMP\n\nBoth men have broadly used tariffs to protect U.S. industry, though Trump's proposals - which include putting a 10% duty on all imports - are far more extreme than those of his rival.\n\n\"President Trump's America First economic program will deliver middle class tax cuts, record-setting regulation cuts, fair trade, abundant energy, low inflation, better wages and a restoration of the rule of law in America,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the content of Zients' address. Biden is in Italy for a G7 summit, where he is slated to sign a new security agreement with Ukraine.\n\nWhile in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the U.S. Capitol. Those meetings are expected to focus on the policy priorities of a potential second Trump term.\n\nThe Business Roundtable routinely asks major party presidential candidates to address the group during election years. Even so, Trump's appearance underlines how some in the business community have warmed to the former president after many companies distanced themselves from him and his supporters following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the weeks after the attack, many major corporations said they would no longer donate to federal politicians who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 vote, which Biden won, though many have since appeared to quietly walk back that pledge.\n\nBusiness titans like Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, have previously forsaken Trump, only to announce in this election cycle that they would support him after he easily dispatched his rivals in the Republican presidential nominating contest earlier this year.\n\n(Reporting by Gram Slattery in Washington;

Joe Biden was also invited; his chief of staff will attend while the US president is abroad, a Business Roundtable spokesperson said.\n\nThe meeting comes less than five months before the election and less than four years after CEOs raised the alarm about political polarization and threats to democracy when Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and incited an insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nBack then, the Business Roundtable - whose members include Apple's Tim Cook, General Motors' Mary Barra and JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon - led a chorus of condemnation from corporate America. \"The country deserves better,\" the Business Roundtable said in a statement on 6 January 2021, calling on Trump and his administration \"to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power\".\n\nToday, with Biden and Trump tied in the polls, Trump can expect a far warmer reception from corporate bosses. \"The reality is ... we as CEOs and we as a Business Roundtable, we're going to work with whoever is in the White House,\" Chuck Robbins, the lobby group's chair and the CEO of Cisco Systems, told Fortune in March.\n\n\"The way we think about it is, if we have a Trump administration or if we have a Biden administration, regardless, there are going to be things we can align on in both,\" Robbins said.\n\nWhile corporate America's views appear to have changed, Trump's have not. The former president still has not accepted the results of the 2020 election, nor has he committed to accepting the 2024 outcome. He maintains that the supporters who he urged to storm the Capitol \"were there with love in their heart\".\n\nAnd Trump and his campaign have promised a range of divisive and anti-democratic initiatives if he is re-elected, from mass firings of non-partisan government officials to the weaponization of the US Department of Justice against his perceived enemies.\n\nYet a second Trump term promises benefits for CEOs and their companies in a variety of policy areas, from lucrative tax breaks - Trump's recent pledges include a \"business class big tax cut\" - to sweeping rollbacks of Biden-era efforts to promote market competition and strengthen worker power.\n\n\"It has always been clear that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not what is going to preserve democracy, and that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 work for their investors who demand insatiable amounts of profit,\" said Lindsay Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group.\n\n\"If they think that President Trump is perilous for democracy but good for profits, I think it has always been clear where they are going to land on this question.\"\n\n'A sad time for our country'\n\nA few days after the 2020 election, dozens of CEOs gathered on a hastily organized 7am Zoom call to discuss Trump's refusal to accept that he had lost.\n\nThe executives met \"to share observations and talk about what possible roles they might play in encouraging a smooth transfer of power\", Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who has spent decades counseling chief executives, and who convened the post-election Zoom, later wrote.\n\nAttending the call were the heads of some of America's largest corporations, including Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Blackstone, Comcast and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe next day, the Business Roundtable, which counted many of the attending CEOs as members, issued a high-profile statement congratulating Biden and Kamala Harris and urging \"elected officials and Americans across the political spectrum to work in good faith to find common ground\".\n\nA similar pattern played out in the days surrounding the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol: CEOs and their companies quickly distanced themselves from Trump. Many pledged to stop making campaign contributions to Republican politicians who voted against certifying the election results. Executives were portrayed in the media as patriots who put their self-interest aside and their reputations at risk to speak out.\n\n\"It's just a sad time for our country,\" Robbins, the Cisco boss, told the New York Times. \"At a time where we have so many challenges, the partisanship is astounding.\"\n\n\"Our leaders must call for peace and unity now,\" tweeted Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, on 6 January. \"There is no room for violence in our democracy. May the one who brings peace bring peace to our country.\"\n\nWhile the full list of attendees of the 2020 Zoom call has not been published, the Guardian contacted a dozen companies and trade groups whose current or previous CEOs or members were reported to have joined the call or expressed concerns about Trump's commitment to the democratic process, such as Cisco and Salesforce.\n\nThe Guardian sought comment from the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, another corporate lobbying group, which on January 6 called for Trump's cabinet to consider removing him from office using the 25th amendment.\n\nOne company declined to comment. Of the other firms and trade groups, none responded to inquiries about whether they remained concerned about Trump's commitment to democracy, or whether they would speak out if Trump were to express an unwillingness to accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses.\n\n'They've done the math'\n\nCorporate America's relationship to Trump is complicated. \"The narrative that the business community is hedging their bets and that CEOs are 'softening towards Donald Trump' is escalating and fast becoming a fact-free echo chamber of unsupported pronouncements,\" Yale's Sonnenfeld argued earlier this year.\n\nFew chief executives of large US companies are personally donating to Trump's campaign, Sonnenfeld noted. \"The money trail, or lack thereof, speaks to the frayed ties between Trump and the business world.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Sonnenfeld pointed to a number of policy issues on which CEOs disagreed with the former president. Chief executives \"are pro-immigration reform. They are not xenophobes. And ... they are not protectionist. They believe in a globalized economy,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\n\"They also believe in social harmony, either out of personal character, patriotic values or enlightened self-interest. They don't want furious communities tearing apart the social fabric. They don't want shareholders screaming at them. They don't want employees sabotaging each other. They depend on social harmony to navigate their businesses.\"\n\n\"Today, there's no support of any public CEO for Trump, even though ... the polls are far more favorable to him than they were in the earlier two elections,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\nBut experts and advocates noted that on a range of issues - among them, tax cuts, efforts to undermine collective bargaining and worker power, and regulatory rollbacks, especially environmental protections - CEOs have plenty of reasons to expect that a second Trump term could prove lucrative.\n\n\"We actually don't need to overanalyze it,\" said Michael Linden, a former Biden administration official who is now a fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"At the end of the day, corporations and CEOs have always liked low taxes. They've always liked deregulation.\n\n\"For all of Donald Trump's heterodoxy on some issues, [on] those things\" - taxes and regulations - \"he is standard. He is indistinguishable from Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney or George W Bush or pick your standard Republican.\"\n\n\"I think they've done the math,\" said Timi Iwayemi of the Revolving Door Project, which tracks corporate political influence. \"They can say, 'We've already seen Trump. We had Trump 1.0. Yeah, sure, it was bad, but it wasn't the end of America. America is still here.'\"\n\n'The stakes are huge, and they are real'\n\nOne of Trump's few legislative achievements as president was a huge tax cut that permanently slashed the corporate tax rate by 40%.\n\nA recent report by the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep) found that the law saved some of America's biggest and most profitable companies $240bn in taxes between 2018 - the first full year it was in effect - and 2021.\n\nWalmart, for instance, paid an average effective tax rate of 31% between 2013 and 2016. After Trump signed his tax cuts into law, the company's average rate fell to 17%, Itep found. The change saved the consumer goods giant $9bn between 2018 and 2021.\n\nSalesforce, meanwhile, paid only $175m in federal taxes over the first five years of the Trump tax cuts, according to previous Itep research. Salesforce brought home about $6bn in profit during the same period.\n\n\"Obviously, the US government is a large customer of Salesforce, and depending on who's in office, it creates a whole stir with a different part of our employee base,\" Salesforce's Benioff told Bloomberg in January. \"So that's just a reality. But the reality is that, hey, we are the same company regardless of when that election is going to occur and regardless of who that president will be.\"\n\nTrump has promised to reduce the corporate tax rate even further if he wins a second term. But corporations are gearing up for an even bigger tax fight next year.\n\nCuts to individual income and estate taxes, as well as business \"pass-through\" rates - changes that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy and white Americans - are set to expire next December.\n\n\"Whether they just expire, whether they get replaced by something, whether they get extended, is a massive question, and it will be a question that Congress has to deal with and the president has to deal with one way or the other,\" said Equitable Growth's Linden. \"And so the stakes are huge, and they are real.\"\n\nFor corporations, these stakes are even higher following their failure earlier this year to secure passage of a congressional tax deal that would have rolled back some of the taxes meant to pay for Trump's 2017 tax law.\n\nCompanies and their trade groups lobbied aggressively for these provisions, which could have saved them hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, the Guardian previously reported.\n\n\"I think they assume under Trump they will not only get an extension of the status quo, which is very beneficial to them, but they will also have another bite at the apple to get even more than they currently have,\" said Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative.\n\n'A huge turn-off to business leaders'\n\nIn other policy areas, a second Trump administration would have more leeway to unilaterally pursue an agenda friendly to big business - and would enter office with a savvier understanding of how to achieve it.\n\n\"In 2024 Trump will be a much more professional operation,\" said the Revolving Door Project's Iwayemi. \"They have a much more clear and deep understanding of the executive branch. And they would have a team that would be fully equipped.\"\n\nLast year, the rightwing Heritage Foundation published \"Project 2025\", a policy-by-policy, agency-by-agency roadmap to \"dismantle the administrative state\", as the organization's president described it.\n\nProject 2025 includes a range of policy levers that would roll back efforts to promote economic competition and protect workers. Many of the recommendations align with positions that corporate interests have already taken.\n\nFor instance, Biden's Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved new requirements for public companies to disclose some of the risks that climate change presents to their businesses.\n\nThe final SEC rule was weaker than the agency's original proposal, and even incorporated recommendations from the Business Roundtable and other trade groups not to require companies to track or report on the climate impacts of their supply chains.\n\nNevertheless, immediately after the rule was finalized, Republican state attorneys general and the US Chamber of Commerce, another corporate lobbying group, sued the agency.\n\n\"Everybody here [at the Business Roundtable] is committed to climate change, to controlling our carbon footprint,\" Robbins told CNBC the day after the SEC finalized the climate disclosure rule. \"But some of the requirements - first of all, we're not sure it's the SEC's remit to do that. But secondly ... it's just an incredible amount of work that actually increases costs at a time when we're talking about inflation ...\"\n\nProject 2025 goes even further, suggesting that Congress prohibit the SEC from requiring these types of disclosures in the first place.\n\nIt also encourages repeal of other reporting rules that became law after the 2008 financial crisis, such as a requirement that public companies disclose the ratio of CEO compensation to median worker pay. The Business Roundtable spent years opposing federal efforts to require companies to disclose this measure of executive compensation.\n\nAnother agency that has drawn borderline-obsessive corporate ire is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which under Biden has taken a far more aggressive approach to challenging corporate power than any administration - Republican or Democratic - for decades.\n\nEarlier this year the FTC finalized a landmark ban on non-compete clauses. The ban, as the FTC chair, Lina Khan, described it, helps make sure workers \"have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business or bring a new idea to market\".\n\n\"Something that I think Americans have been hungry for, for a long time\" is for government \"in a muscular way [to] protect them not just as consumers but also as workers and small businesses from serious abuse from big corporations\", said Elizabeth Wilkins, a former White House official who recently stepped down as the FTC's chief of staff.\n\n\"This is stuff that people want, but ... it's also stuff that big corporations have been getting away with for a long time,\" said Wilkins, now a fellow at the anti-monopoly American Economic Liberties Project. \"I am sure that they aren't happy about it.\"\n\nThe day after the FTC finalized the ban on non-competes, the Business Roundtable filed a lawsuit to stop what it called \"this unwarranted regulatory overreach\".\n\n\"The Federal Trade Commission is a huge turn-off to business leaders,\" said Yale's Sonnenfeld.\n\n\"Corporations recognize that there's an alphabet soup of government agencies with the power to properly enforce longstanding laws and, when necessary, crack down [on] corporate exploitation,\" said Iwayemi.\n\nThey \"recognize that if you pull any acronym out of the pot - take the SEC or the FTC or whichever - they have the potential to sell out public interest. And that is just much more likely under the Trump administration.\"\n\n'They are not the central heroes of the economic story'\n\nDespite their complaints about the Biden agenda, the fact remains that US corporations have thrived during Biden's time in office, routinely reporting record profits and awarding sky-high CEO pay.\n\nIn 2023, the median head of an S&P 500 company took home more than $16m, an increase of nearly 13% from the previous year, according to a recent AP and Equilar analysis. Workers' wages grew only 4%, the report found.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations are salivating over hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax incentives created by Biden-era legislation to tackle climate change and spur domestic investment in infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAnd far from freezing out corporate America - as some progressives had hoped - the Biden White House has aggressively solicited executives' input. Wilkins described the administration conducting \"an enormous amount of outreach to the corporate community\".\n\n\"They engage, for sure,\" Robbins told CNBC in March. \"There's open communication - there always is. So that's not the issue.\"\n\nStill, bosses appear increasingly fed up with Biden's rhetoric.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has \"been great for business\" and most CEOs are not actively supporting Trump's re-election bid, that \"doesn't mean that they're pro-Biden,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\n\"There are plenty of issues that they have [with Biden] on certain areas. They don't like being vilified on the tax front, even though maybe some should pay some higher taxes. They smart on setting up a class warfare.\"\n\nThe president \"puts workers at the center of the economic universe: unions and labor power and competition and higher taxes on the rich\", said Linden. Corporations \"really get offended when people suggest that they are not the central heroes of the economic story. They really don't like that.\"\n\nTrump might praise wealthy CEOs, or at least refrain from saying they should pay higher taxes or suffer new consumer protections.\n\nYet one of the former president's defining characteristics remains his fanatical pursuit of grudges against perceived enemies and those who he believes have slighted him.\n\nThis track record suggests that CEOs' silence today - perhaps a result of Trump's coin-flip odds of ending up back in the White House - may not guarantee their protection from his vindictiveness tomorrow.\n\nThat, however, is a gamble that many executives appear willing to make.\n\nFor CEOs: \"There may be limited downside to making nice noises about Trump,\" suggested Rosanna Weaver, a consultant for the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. \"If Trump is elected you have some credit with him. If Biden is elected, he is unlikely to hold the same kind of vindictive grudge that Trump would.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Trump then told the CEOs a story about how excited tipped workers were about his proposal, prompting laughter from the corporate leaders, according to multiple sources.\n\nTrump spoke for about an hour at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting. The audience included Apple CEO Tim Cook, JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients addressed the group earlier in the day, according to a source.\n\nCNBC sources were granted anonymity in order to speak freely about a private gathering.\n\n\"We're going to give you more of the same for the next four years,\" a person in the room said, describing Trump's message for the company leaders.\n\nRepresentatives for the Trump campaign and the Business Roundtable did not return requests for comment before publication.\n\nFor Trump and the CEOs who attended, the meeting represented an effort to mend relations after some have distanced themselves from the former president.\n\nBusiness advisory groups were disbanded in 2017 after Trump tried to equivocate \"both sides\" of protests in Charlottesville, Va. that featured white nationalists. During the riot on Jan. 6, 2021 on Capitol Hill, executives, including members of the Business Roundtable, called on Trump to stop the violence.\n\nTrump also took a dig at Biden. \"We need a president who is at the top of his game and let's face it, this president is not at the top of his game.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Cook declined to comment on whether he attended the meeting.\n\nTrump told a meeting full of House Republicans earlier in the day about the idea of imposing an \"all tariff policy\" that would ultimately enable the U.S. to get rid of the income tax.", "source": {"uri":

He also met Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a roughly hour-long conversation with his former National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, Trump discussed his right-wing economic agenda and bashed President Joe Biden's handling of global events, from the US's withdrawal from Afghanistan to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Hamas's attack on Israel.\n\nThe former president told his audience he would consider lowering the 21 per cent corporate tax rate even further, after cutting it from 35 per cent in 2017, according to one person who attended.\n\n\"I thought he came across as solid, almost business-like, and not something else like we sometimes see,\" said an executive who was in the room.\n\nAnother CEO in attendance said: \"It was the same Trump we have seen and heard a hundred times but more subdued.\"\n\nTrump's economic adviser Stephen Moore said the former president had stressed deregulation and the use of tariffs on imports as a \"negotiating tactic\" with foreign countries. He said Trump would extend his 2017 tax cuts, some of which are due to expire in 2025.\n\nThe former president also mentioned his plan to remove taxes on tips, and drew laughter from the audience when he said he had spoken to a waitress and golf caddies who liked the idea.\n\nThe Business Roundtable invites both presidential candidates to address its 200 chief executive members ahead of every US election.\n\nAmong those who gave the event a miss were Microsoft's Satya Nadella, BlackRock's Larry Fink, Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, who has already endorsed Trump, as well as Darren Woods of ExxonMobil and Bill Thomas of KPMG.\n\nBiden's chief of staff Jeff Zients stood in for the president, who is at the G7 summit in Italy, and warned the CEOs they should not take political stability for granted, according to some people who were in the room. He praised several chief executives including Apple's Cook.\n\nCircling outside the Business Roundtable headquarters was a mobile advertisement paid for by the Democratic party, blasting out footage from Trump's recent fraud conviction in New York and the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol by a mob of his supporters.\n\nCorporate America has enjoyed record profits under Biden but many business leaders are wary of some of the president's budget proposals, including higher taxes for rich individuals and corporations, as well as on capital gains and stock buybacks.\n\nTrump has won growing support among Wall Street bosses in recent weeks, with hedge fund titans including Bill Ackman saying they are likely to support him in this year's White House race.\n\nThe Business Roundtable will launch an eight-figure ad campaign ahead of the election advocating to keep the 21 per cent corporate tax rate and low taxes on income earned abroad and on intellectual property.\n\nMany business leaders said they were sceptical of both Biden and Trump. One Business Roundtable member told the Financial Times: \"We are facing the most disastrous combination of presidential candidates in the history of the United States.\"\n\n\"No matter whether it's Trump or Biden [who wins in November], I think we're in a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny,\" added a chief financial officer of a Business Roundtable company. \"When it's all said and done we'll play the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Kudlow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Kudlow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Economic_Council_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Economic Council (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moynihan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Moynihan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Trump's address at the Business Roundtable highlights his policies on tax cuts and trade, while Biden's team emphasizes environmental protections and corporate tax increases.\n\nU.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and key advisers to Democratic President Joe Biden will lay out their dramatically divergent economic views in a series of conversations with America's top business leaders on Thursday.\n\nTrump is due to speak to the Business Roundtable at the group's headquarters in Washington, D.C., at approximately 11 a.m. local time (1500 GMT), according to two sources familiar with the event's planning. The association of more than 200 CEOs will also host Jeff Zients, Biden's White House chief of staff, earlier in the morning, those people said. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, meanwhile, will address the Economic Club of New York at 12:30 p.m., where she will discuss \"expanding the U.S. economy's productive capacity,\" according to a Treasury Department statement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what message Trump or Zients planned to deliver to the Business Roundtable, which counts Wall Street heavyweights including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman as members. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser are among those attending, according to three sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nConservative commentator Larry Kudlow, who served as a key economic adviser during Trump's 2017 to 2021 term, will interview the former president during the event, one of the people said. Biden and Trump, who are locked in a tight race five months before the Nov. 5 election, disagree on a number of major economic issues.\n\nBiden has made protecting the environment a core part of his economic plans. His administration has, for instance, created a series of incentives for the purchase and use of electric vehicles, and in January his administration paused approvals for applications to export liquefied natural gas from new projects. Trump, while at times light on specifics, has attacked measures meant to hasten the transition of the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels and has repeatedly claimed that electric vehicles do not work.\n\nWhile in office, Trump cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Biden has proposed increasing the top rate for large corporations to 28%, below historic levels, but above the current figure. BUSINESS TITANS RETURN TO TRUMP\n\nBoth men have broadly used tariffs to protect U.S. industry, though Trump's proposals - which include putting a 10% duty on all imports - are far more extreme than those of his rival. \"President Trump's America First economic program will deliver middle class tax cuts, record-setting regulation cuts, fair trade, abundant energy, low inflation, better wages and a restoration of the rule of law in America,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the content of Zients' address. Biden is in Italy for a G7 summit, where he is slated to sign a new security agreement with Ukraine. While in Washington, Trump is also slated to speak to Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives at locations close to the U.S. Capitol. Those meetings are expected to focus on the policy priorities of a potential second Trump term.\n\nThe Business Roundtable routinely asks major party presidential candidates to address the group during election years. Even so, Trump's appearance underlines how some in the business community have warmed to the former president after many companies distanced themselves from him and his supporters following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. In the weeks after the attack, many major corporations said they would no longer donate to federal politicians who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 vote, which Biden won, though many have since appeared to quietly walk back that pledge.\n\nBusiness titans like Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, have previously forsaken Trump, only to announce in this election cycle that they would support him after he easily dispatched his rivals in the Republican presidential nominating contest earlier this year.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Club_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic Club of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Kudlow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Kudlow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

The charges made Trump the first former president to also be a convicted felon.\n\nAs the highly publicized trial came to a close, the Trump campaign kicked its fundraising efforts into high gear. Last week, the campaign revealed that it raised $141 million in funding last month alone, with nearly $35 million of that coming in the hours following Trump's guilty verdict. Billionaire GOP donors that have already backed Trump this time around include magnate Miriam Adelson and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBusiness Roundtable, a nonprofit lobbying group that promotes business-friendly government policy, is comprised of more than 200 CEOs across industries. These executives represent companies that make up almost a quarter of U.S. GDP, according to the group.\n\nRoughly 100 CEOs are expected to attend Thursday's event, Bloomberg reported. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow will host talks with Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was also invited to the event, but is in Italy meeting with Group of 7 leaders.\n\nDespite the group's seeming embrace of Trump, Business Roundtable hasn't shied away from criticizing the former president.

Bank of America also confirmed Moynihans' presence.\n\nOthers expected to attend include Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo, Adena Friedman of Nasdaq and Steve Squeri of American Express.\n\nThe event also comes just two weeks after Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to the reimbursement of a secret payment to the star of adult film Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. These accusations made Trump the first former president to also be a convicted felon.\n\nAs the high-profile trial drew to a close, the Trump campaign ramped up its fundraising efforts. Last week, the campaign revealed that it had raised $141 million in funding last month alone, including nearly $35 million in the hours following Trump's guilty verdict. Billionaire Republican Party donors who have already backed Trump this time include tycoon Miriam Adelson and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBusiness Roundtable, a nonprofit lobbying group that promotes business-friendly government policy, is made up of more than 200 CEOs from across industries. These executives represent companies that account for nearly a quarter of U.S. GDP, according to the group.\n\nAbout 100 CEOs are expected to attend Thursday's event, Bloomberg reported. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow will host talks with Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was also invited to the event, but he is in Italy to meet with Group of Seven leaders.\n\nEven though the groups appear to support Trump, Business Roundtable has not shied away from criticizing the former president. Following the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, the group released a statement condemning attempts to overturn the 2020 election and calling on Trump to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.\n\nDuring his visit to Washington, Trump is also expected to meet with lawmakers from his party.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scharf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Scharf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quartz (publication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Joe Biden was also invited; his chief of staff will attend while the US president is abroad, a Business Roundtable spokesperson said.\n\nThe meeting comes less than five months before the election and less than four years after CEOs raised the alarm about political polarization and threats to democracy when Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and incited an insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nBack then, the Business Roundtable - whose members include Apple's Tim Cook, General Motors' Mary Barra and JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon - led a chorus of condemnation from corporate America. \"The country deserves better,\" the Business Roundtable said in a statement on 6 January 2021, calling on Trump and his administration \"to put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power\".\n\nToday, with Biden and Trump tied in the polls, Trump can expect a far warmer reception from corporate bosses. \"The reality is ... we as CEOs and we as a Business Roundtable, we're going to work with whoever is in the White House,\" Chuck Robbins, the lobby group's chair and the CEO of Cisco Systems, told Fortune in March.\n\n\"The way we think about it is, if we have a Trump administration or if we have a Biden administration, regardless, there are going to be things we can align on in both,\" Robbins said.\n\nWhile corporate America's views appear to have changed, Trump's have not. The former president still has not accepted the results of the 2020 election, nor has he committed to accepting the 2024 outcome. He maintains that the supporters who he urged to storm the Capitol \"were there with love in their heart\".\n\nAnd Trump and his campaign have promised a range of divisive and anti-democratic initiatives if he is re-elected, from mass firings of non-partisan government officials to the weaponization of the US Department of Justice against his perceived enemies.\n\nYet a second Trump term promises benefits for CEOs and their companies in a variety of policy areas, from lucrative tax breaks - Trump's recent pledges include a \"business class big tax cut\" - to sweeping rollbacks of Biden-era efforts to promote market competition and strengthen worker power.\n\n\"It has always been clear that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not what is going to preserve democracy, and that the CEOs of the Fortune 500 work for their investors who demand insatiable amounts of profit,\" said Lindsay Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group.\n\n\"If they think that President Trump is perilous for democracy but good for profits, I think it has always been clear where they are going to land on this question.\"\n\nA few days after the 2020 election, dozens of CEOs gathered on a hastily organized 7am Zoom call to discuss Trump's refusal to accept that he had lost.\n\nThe executives met \"to share observations and talk about what possible roles they might play in encouraging a smooth transfer of power\", Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who has spent decades counseling chief executives, and who convened the post-election Zoom, later wrote.\n\nAttending the call were the heads of some of America's largest corporations, including Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Blackstone, Comcast and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe next day, the Business Roundtable, which counted many of the attending CEOs as members, issued a high-profile statement congratulating Biden and Kamala Harris and urging \"elected officials and Americans across the political spectrum to work in good faith to find common ground\".\n\nA similar pattern played out in the days surrounding the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol: CEOs and their companies quickly distanced themselves from Trump. Many pledged to stop making campaign contributions to Republican politicians who voted against certifying the election results. Executives were portrayed in the media as patriots who put their self-interest aside and their reputations at risk to speak out.\n\n\"It's just a sad time for our country,\" Robbins, the Cisco boss, told the New York Times. \"At a time where we have so many challenges, the partisanship is astounding.\"\n\n\"Our leaders must call for peace and unity now,\" tweeted Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, on 6 January. \"There is no room for violence in our democracy. May the one who brings peace bring peace to our country.\"\n\nWhile the full list of attendees of the 2020 Zoom call has not been published, the Guardian contacted a dozen companies and trade groups whose current or previous CEOs or members were reported to have joined the call or expressed concerns about Trump's commitment to the democratic process, such as Cisco and Salesforce.\n\nThe Guardian sought comment from the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, another corporate lobbying group, which on January 6 called for Trump's cabinet to consider removing him from office using the 25th amendment.\n\nOne company declined to comment. Of the other firms and trade groups, none responded to inquiries about whether they remained concerned about Trump's commitment to democracy, or whether they would speak out if Trump were to express an unwillingness to accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses.\n\nCorporate America's relationship to Trump is complicated. \"The narrative that the business community is hedging their bets and that CEOs are 'softening towards Donald Trump' is escalating and fast becoming a fact-free echo chamber of unsupported pronouncements,\" Yale's Sonnenfeld argued earlier this year.\n\nFew chief executives of large US companies are personally donating to Trump's campaign, Sonnenfeld noted. \"The money trail, or lack thereof, speaks to the frayed ties between Trump and the business world.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Sonnenfeld pointed to a number of policy issues on which CEOs disagreed with the former president. Chief executives \"are pro-immigration reform. They are not xenophobes. And ... they are not protectionist. They believe in a globalized economy,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\n\"They also believe in social harmony, either out of personal character, patriotic values or enlightened self-interest. They don't want furious communities tearing apart the social fabric. They don't want shareholders screaming at them. They don't want employees sabotaging each other. They depend on social harmony to navigate their businesses.\"\n\n\"Today, there's no support of any public CEO for Trump, even though ... the polls are far more favorable to him than they were in the earlier two elections,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\nBut experts and advocates noted that on a range of issues - among them, tax cuts, efforts to undermine collective bargaining and worker power, and regulatory rollbacks, especially environmental protections - CEOs have plenty of reasons to expect that a second Trump term could prove lucrative.\n\n\"We actually don't need to overanalyze it,\" said Michael Linden, a former Biden administration official who is now a fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"At the end of the day, corporations and CEOs have always liked low taxes. They've always liked deregulation.\n\n\"For all of Donald Trump's heterodoxy on some issues, [on] those things\" - taxes and regulations - \"he is standard. He is indistinguishable from Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney or George W Bush or pick your standard Republican.\"\n\n\"I think they've done the math,\" said Timi Iwayemi of the Revolving Door Project, which tracks corporate political influence. \"They can say, 'We've already seen Trump. We had Trump 1.0. Yeah, sure, it was bad, but it wasn't the end of America. America is still here.'\"\n\nOne of Trump's few legislative achievements as president was a huge tax cut that permanently slashed the corporate tax rate by 40%.\n\nA recent report by the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep) found that the law saved some of America's biggest and most profitable companies $240bn in taxes between 2018 - the first full year it was in effect - and 2021.\n\nWalmart, for instance, paid an average effective tax rate of 31% between 2013 and 2016. After Trump signed his tax cuts into law, the company's average rate fell to 17%, Itep found. The change saved the consumer goods giant $9bn between 2018 and 2021.\n\nSalesforce, meanwhile, paid only $175m in federal taxes over the first five years of the Trump tax cuts, according to previous Itep research. Salesforce brought home about $6bn in profit during the same period.\n\n\"Obviously, the US government is a large customer of Salesforce, and depending on who's in office, it creates a whole stir with a different part of our employee base,\" Salesforce's Benioff told Bloomberg in January. \"So that's just a reality. But the reality is that, hey, we are the same company regardless of when that election is going to occur and regardless of who that president will be.\"\n\nTrump has promised to reduce the corporate tax rate even further if he wins a second term. But corporations are gearing up for an even bigger tax fight next year.\n\nCuts to individual income and estate taxes, as well as business \"pass-through\" rates - changes that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy and white Americans - are set to expire next December.\n\n\"Whether they just expire, whether they get replaced by something, whether they get extended, is a massive question, and it will be a question that Congress has to deal with and the president has to deal with one way or the other,\" said Equitable Growth's Linden. \"And so the stakes are huge, and they are real.\"\n\nFor corporations, these stakes are even higher following their failure earlier this year to secure passage of a congressional tax deal that would have rolled back some of the taxes meant to pay for Trump's 2017 tax law.\n\nCompanies and their trade groups lobbied aggressively for these provisions, which could have saved them hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, the Guardian previously reported.\n\n\"I think they assume under Trump they will not only get an extension of the status quo, which is very beneficial to them, but they will also have another bite at the apple to get even more than they currently have,\" said Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative.\n\nIn other policy areas, a second Trump administration would have more leeway to unilaterally pursue an agenda friendly to big business - and would enter office with a savvier understanding of how to achieve it.\n\n\"In 2024 Trump will be a much more professional operation,\" said the Revolving Door Project's Iwayemi. \"They have a much more clear and deep understanding of the executive branch. And they would have a team that would be fully equipped.\"\n\nLast year, the rightwing Heritage Foundation published \"Project 2025\", a policy-by-policy, agency-by-agency roadmap to \"dismantle the administrative state\", as the organization's president described it.\n\nProject 2025 includes a range of policy levers that would roll back efforts to promote economic competition and protect workers. Many of the recommendations align with positions that corporate interests have already taken.\n\nFor instance, Biden's Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved new requirements for public companies to disclose some of the risks that climate change presents to their businesses.\n\nThe final SEC rule was weaker than the agency's original proposal, and even incorporated recommendations from the Business Roundtable and other trade groups not to require companies to track or report on the climate impacts of their supply chains.\n\nNevertheless, immediately after the rule was finalized, Republican state attorneys general and the US Chamber of Commerce, another corporate lobbying group, sued the agency.\n\n\"Everybody here [at the Business Roundtable] is committed to climate change, to controlling our carbon footprint,\" Robbins told CNBC the day after the SEC finalized the climate disclosure rule. \"But some of the requirements - first of all, we're not sure it's the SEC's remit to do that. But secondly ... it's just an incredible amount of work that actually increases costs at a time when we're talking about inflation ...\"\n\nProject 2025 goes even further, suggesting that Congress prohibit the SEC from requiring these types of disclosures in the first place.\n\nIt also encourages repeal of other reporting rules that became law after the 2008 financial crisis, such as a requirement that public companies disclose the ratio of CEO compensation to median worker pay. The Business Roundtable spent years opposing federal efforts to require companies to disclose this measure of executive compensation.\n\nAnother agency that has drawn borderline-obsessive corporate ire is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which under Biden has taken a far more aggressive approach to challenging corporate power than any administration - Republican or Democratic - for decades.\n\nEarlier this year the FTC finalized a landmark ban on non-compete clauses. The ban, as the FTC chair, Lina Khan, described it, helps make sure workers \"have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business or bring a new idea to market\".\n\n\"Something that I think Americans have been hungry for, for a long time\" is for government \"in a muscular way [to] protect them not just as consumers but also as workers and small businesses from serious abuse from big corporations\", said Elizabeth Wilkins, a former White House official who recently stepped down as the FTC's chief of staff.\n\n\"This is stuff that people want, but ... it's also stuff that big corporations have been getting away with for a long time,\" said Wilkins, now a fellow at the anti-monopoly American Economic Liberties Project. \"I am sure that they aren't happy about it.\"\n\nThe day after the FTC finalized the ban on non-competes, the Business Roundtable filed a lawsuit to stop what it called \"this unwarranted regulatory overreach\".\n\n\"The Federal Trade Commission is a huge turn-off to business leaders,\" said Yale's Sonnenfeld.\n\n\"Corporations recognize that there's an alphabet soup of government agencies with the power to properly enforce longstanding laws and, when necessary, crack down [on] corporate exploitation,\" said Iwayemi.\n\nThey \"recognize that if you pull any acronym out of the pot - take the SEC or the FTC or whichever - they have the potential to sell out public interest. And that is just much more likely under the Trump administration.\"\n\nDespite their complaints about the Biden agenda, the fact remains that US corporations have thrived during Biden's time in office, routinely reporting record profits and awarding sky-high CEO pay.\n\nIn 2023, the median head of an S&P 500 company took home more than $16m, an increase of nearly 13% from the previous year, according to a recent AP and Equilar analysis. Workers' wages grew only 4%, the report found.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations are salivating over hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax incentives created by Biden-era legislation to tackle climate change and spur domestic investment in infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAnd far from freezing out corporate America - as some progressives had hoped - the Biden White House has aggressively solicited executives' input. Wilkins described the administration conducting \"an enormous amount of outreach to the corporate community\".\n\n\"They engage, for sure,\" Robbins told CNBC in March. \"There's open communication - there always is. So that's not the issue.\"\n\nStill, bosses appear increasingly fed up with Biden's rhetoric.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has \"been great for business\" and most CEOs are not actively supporting Trump's re-election bid, that \"doesn't mean that they're pro-Biden,\" Sonnenfeld said.\n\n\"There are plenty of issues that they have [with Biden] on certain areas. They don't like being vilified on the tax front, even though maybe some should pay some higher taxes. They smart on setting up a class warfare.\"\n\nThe president \"puts workers at the center of the economic universe: unions and labor power and competition and higher taxes on the rich\", said Linden. Corporations \"really get offended when people suggest that they are not the central heroes of the economic story. They really don't like that.\"\n\nTrump might praise wealthy CEOs, or at least refrain from saying they should pay higher taxes or suffer new consumer protections.\n\nYet one of the former president's defining characteristics remains his fanatical pursuit of grudges against perceived enemies and those who he believes have slighted him.\n\nThis track record suggests that CEOs' silence today - perhaps a result of Trump's coin-flip odds of ending up back in the White House - may not guarantee their protection from his vindictiveness tomorrow.\n\nThat, however, is a gamble that many executives appear willing to make.\n\nFor CEOs: \"There may be limited downside to making nice noises about Trump,\" suggested Rosanna Weaver, a consultant for the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. \"If Trump is elected you have some credit with him.

Trump called the 20% figure a nice, round figure, according to two sources briefed on his comments.\n\nTrump vowed to make permanent the Republicans' sweeping 2017 tax law and called to renew key portions of the bill, including tax cuts for individuals and small businesses, which expire next year. He also advocated to exempt tipped earnings from federal taxes, an idea he first previewed at a rally on Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nTrump offered up his thoughts on the US economy during a 'fireside chat' with Larry Kudlow, his former National Economic Council Director, at a quarterly meeting of CEOs hosted by Business Roundtable, a corporate advocacy group led by former White House chief-of-staff Joshua Bolten.\n\nTrump promised the executives he would slash regulations if he won a second term. He also disparaged the permitting process for energy projects and other purposes as yet another form of regulation or taxation.

He is promising to extend those cuts and also potentially make new ones, including an idea to further lower the corporate tax rate.\n\nDuring his visit to Washington, Trump is set to attend a series of closed-door meetings. He will meet first with House Republicans, then with Business Roundtable CEOs, then with Republican Senators to plot strategy and try to garner support around taxes and other issues.\n\n\"When he comes in, we've got to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday ahead of the visit.\n\nJohnson and other lawmakers are making plans -- if their party sweeps the House, Senate, and Presidential elections this fall -- to quickly push an extension of those tax cuts through Congress using a process known as reconciliation.\n\nThe maneuver requires only a simple majority in the Senate but requires unified control of government by one party.\n\nA question is whether Trump's meeting will follow a similar pattern of private Trump pitches in recent months where the former President, according to some experts, has neared the line of making campaign finance violations by linking his tax and regulation plans with campaign donations.\n\nA recent Washington Post report found Trump met with oil executives and told them they should raise $1 billion for his campaign, telling them it would be a \"deal\" because of the money they would save.\n\nBiden's pitch\n\nBiden's emerging pitch to business is focused on more government support for business.\n\nWith the President in Europe, it is falling to Secretary Yellen to offer that message.\n\nShe is set to speak to the Economic Club of New York Thursday where she will focus on how a second term for Biden could include more government help for businesses -- while also standing firm that tax cuts would likely end.\n\nIt's a speech that, according to excerpts released in advance, will focus on what she calls \"modern supply-side economics.\"\n\nYellen will say that \"traditional supply-side economics wrongly assumes that policies such as tax cuts for those at the top and deregulation will fuel growth and prosperity for the nation at large.\"\n\nHer speech will instead lay out a plan for additional collaboration and say \"this broad-based approach brings benefits not just for American workers and families but for businesses and the economy as a whole.\"\n\nBiden has indeed had notable successes using government power to spur strategically important sectors.\n\nThe 2021 CHIPs and Science Act spawned a wave of new semiconductor activity and put the US on pace, top officials said, to produce 20% of the world's most advanced semiconductor chips by the end of the decade. The U.S. currently produces 0% of these chips.\n\nAnd just this week, the White House announced that an electric vehicle tax credit in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act has now saved consumers over $1 billion since taking effect in January.\n\nThe question, at least when it comes to how the message is received by CEOs, is whether business leaders will only be interested in the tax issue, where Biden is offering little for them to like.\n\n\"The last thing we wanna do is go backwards on tax,\" said Cisco's Robbins during this week's discussion with reporters.\n\nOther speakers at the event also offered criticism of Biden's plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, saying it would make America one of the least competitive places on the globe to do business..\n\nTrump is promising a move in the opposite direction, down to 15%.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money", "source": {"uri":

{"uri": "8176661304", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-13", "time": "20:22:36", "dateTime": "2024-06-13T20:22:36Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-13T20:20:03Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceos-fear-trump-201630254.html", "title": "Why CEOs fear Trump", "body": "After 34 felony convictions in New York on May 31, Donald Trump is getting back to business as usual, including an off-the-record chat with dozens of CEOs in Washington, D.C., on June 13.\n\nWhether they support his antics or not, CEOs have to take Trump seriously as a presidential candidate, given that he's the only realistic alternative to incumbent President Joe Biden -- and he could win. Trump remains committed to low taxes and light regulation, making him a natural choice for businesspeople, at least based on those policies.\n\nBut there's also considerable trepidation about a second Trump presidency among business leaders. In its latest quarterly survey of businesses, research firm Oxford Economics asked if a second Trump presidency would represent a geopolitical risk. Thirty-four percent said Trump would pose a \"very significant\" political risk if he won the White House again, while 42% said it would pose \"significant\" risk. That's 76% of businesses that see Trump as some sort of threat to their operations.\n\nOxford asked about other types of geopolitical risks, such as hostilities in the Middle East, a clash between Russia and the NATO military alliance, and conflict between China and Taiwan. All scored lower than Trump in terms of representing a \"very significant\" risk. Some business leaders literally worry more about Trump than they worry about major wars.\n\nThe biggest risk Trump 2.0 would pose to business interests is his call for additional tariffs on imports from China and everywhere else. Trump would impose an additional 60% tariff on Chinese imports, with a 10% tariff on all other imports. In general, Trump wants to unwind a system of global trade established over decades and make the US economy far more self-sufficient.\n\nTrump has even suggested getting rid of the income tax and replacing the lost federal revenue with new revenue from higher tariffs. Here's the math on that: Income taxes brought in $2.2 trillion during the latest fiscal year, and annual imports are around $3.8 trillion. So you'd have to start by imposing a 58% tax on imports to raise the missing $2.2 billion. And that doesn't account for inevitable retaliation by trading partners or the massive distortions that such a dramatic move would cause.\n\nThe president can raise or lower tariffs, but only Congress can change tax laws -- and there's basically no chance Congress would ever act on Trump's plan. Among other things, it would benefit rich people the most while forcing massive price hikes onto consumers. But Trump famously looks for unorthodox ways to accomplish pet ideas and doesn't usually worry about collateral damage.\n\nSome CEOs may also worry about Trump's fondness for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the likelihood Trump would abandon Ukraine in its battle to survive the Russian onslaught that began in 2022. A Russian takeover of Ukraine might not affect Western markets immediately, but it would give Russia a huge new launchpad for menacing Europe and possibly invading or trying to destabilize NATO member nations such as Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. As long as Ukraine remains independent, it serves as a crucial buffer zone between the territorial Putin and potential targets, once in the Russian orbit, that Putin would like to possess once more.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nTrump's signature stance is his near-zero tolerance for immigration, which has economic implications as well. Though migration across the southwest border has reached unsustainably high levels under Biden, those migrants have mostly gone to work in the United States, which has helped keep spending going and filled many worker shortages. From a CEO's perspective, migrants help keep labor costs down, and Trump could interfere with that.\n\nTrump was a kind of corporate frenemy during his first term. Businesses loved the tax cuts he signed into law and his regulatory hatchet. But they hated the tariffs he imposed, and a number of companies became targets of Trump himself for their \"woke\" social policies or some perceived slight the touchy Trump blamed them for.\n\nMost CEOs try not to pick sides in political battles and maintain good relations with prominent members of both parties. That seems to be how most business leaders are hoping to deal with Trump in 2024 -- at least until November, when they know whether he won or lost the election.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Trump didn't go far on some issues as he said he would while campaigning. He originally called for 45% tariffs on Chinese imports, for example, but the final tariffs only covered about half of all Chinese shipments to the United States, and they ranged from 7.5% to 25%.\n\nBusiness honchos seem to hope they can get the best of Trump, without the worst, if he wins a second term. \"We're not looking at it as a package deal,\" Joshua Bolten, CEO of the Business Roundtable lobbying group, told reporters recently before hosting Trump at the CEO event on June 13. \"We think taxes ought to be low and tariffs ought not to be put into place.\" That means managing Trump, if he wins, which is a job even the best CEOs may find challenging.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Trump called the 20% figure a nice, round figure, according to two sources briefed on his comments.\n\nTrump vowed to make permanent the Republicans' sweeping 2017 tax law and called to renew key portions of the bill, including tax cuts for individuals and small businesses, which expire next year. He also advocated to exempt tipped earnings from federal taxes, an idea he first previewed at a rally on Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nTrump offered up his thoughts on the US economy during a 'fireside chat' with Larry Kudlow, his former National Economic Council Director, at a quarterly meeting of CEOs hosted by Business Roundtable, a corporate advocacy group led by former White House chief-of-staff Joshua Bolten.\n\nTrump promised the executives he would slash regulations if he won a second term. He also disparaged the permitting process for energy projects and other purposes as yet another form of regulation or taxation.

But England made steady progress nevertheless, thanks to half-centuries from Harry Brook (50) and Joe Root (68), as they went into Lunch on Day 2 at 293/6, with a lead of 172.\n\nAfter a watchful start from Root, Brook got into the act with a crisp cover drive for a four off Jayden Seales. The half-century stand was raised soon after and England crossed the 200 mark before Brook executed a late cut to perfection off Alzarri Joseph to enter the 40s. Root got going with a pull and a lovely cover drive for two fours off Seales. The lead crossed 100 before a controlled pull and a flick gave Root two fours off Alzarri as England made good progress in the first hour.\n\nThe West Indies bowlers were not disciplined enough with their lines and the pitch was also not offering much help. Brook struck the first six of the day by putting away a short delivery from Shamar Joseph and brought up his eighth Test fifty, off 55 balls, with a couple off Alzarri in the next over. West Indies, however, continued to keep it short to Brook and eventually reaped the reward as the No.5 fell to Alzarri, getting a top edge to the 'keeper trying to fetch a pull from outside off. This ended the fourth wicket partnership which was worth 91 runs off only 120 deliveries.\n\nIt was a good little period for West Indies as Ben Stokes fell shortly after Root became the fourth half-centurion in the innings. The England captain was outfoxed by a Gudakesh Motie delivery that pitched outside off and turned in sharply to be bowled for 4, getting out for a single digit score for the fifth time in a row. Debutant Jamie Smith got a freebie from Motie to get his first Test runs as he put away a half-tracker for a boundary. Root then swept a full toss from the left-arm spinner for a four as England's lead grew beyond 150.\n\nSmith was kept largely quiet by the West Indian bowlers before he played a flick and essayed an off drive for successive boundaries off Seales. Motie then went wide of the crease and delivered an arm ball to Root who looked to play the drive but ended up getting bowled. Chris Woakes got off the mark with a cover-driven four off Motie and remained unbeaten at the break along with Smith.\n\nBrief scores: West Indies 121 trail England 293/6 (Zak Crawley 76, Joe Root 68, Ollie Pope 57, Harry Brook 50; Gudakesh Motie 2-25, Jayden Seales 2-57) by 172 runs.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cricbuzz.comhttps://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/600x400/i1/c515718/gundakesh-motie-accounted-for.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Root but England still on top against West Indies", "body": "London (AFP) - Gudakesh Motie had a morning to remember as he dismissed England captain Ben Stokes and Joe Root but the hosts still piled on the runs against the West Indies at Lord's on Thursday.\n\nEngland were 293-6 at lunch on the second day of the first Test, a lead of 172 runs.\n\nRoot fell shortly before the interval for 68 when bowled by a classic delivery from Motie after the left-arm spinner had also removed Stokes for just four on his way to figures of 2-25 in nine overs.\n\nEarlier, Harry Brook gave his wicket away for exactly 50 following a fourth-wicket stand of 94 with Root.\n\nEngland resumed on 189-3, already 68 runs ahead, after fast bowler Gus Atkinson had marked his Test debut with a spectacular return of 7-45 as West Indies collapsed to 121 all out in the first innings of this three-match series.\n\nIn the process the 26-year-old Surrey quick eclipsed James Anderson in what is the record-breaking paceman's 188th and last Test before his England retirement.\n\nRoot was 15 not out and Brook 25 not out, the Yorkshire duo walking out Thursday in sunny conditions ideal for batting.\n\nWith the ball not deviating greatly in the air or off the pitch, it was all the more important for the West Indies' pace attack to maintain an accurate line and length.\n\nEngland, however, scored briskly, with star batsman Root cover-driving Jayden Seales for a textbook four and Brook commandingly hooking Shamar Joseph for six.\n\nBrook's quickfire 55-ball fifty was the 25-year-old's 12th score of 50 or more in his 13 Tests.\n\nBut Brook top-edged a simple catch to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva after trying to hook an Alzarri Joseph bouncer from outside off stump, with England now 244-4.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite eventually brought on Motie for the 15th over of the day and the sixth ball of his spell spun sharply past Stokes' inside edge bat as the left-handed batsman tried to hit legside before crashing into the stumps.\n\nRoot also fell to Motie, bowled by a delivery that spun past the right-hander's outside edge to end a 114-ball innings including seven fours.\n\nThursday was also 'Red for Ruth Day' at Lord's -- a fundraising drive for a cancer charity established in memory of Ruth Strauss, the late wife of former England captain Andrew Strauss.",

With Harry Brook and Joe Root falling after scoring fifties, Smith stepped up and received good support from Chris Woakes as England finished with 371, getting a lead of 250.\n\nGudakesh Motie and Alzarri Joseph bowled in tandem at the start of the second session, with the pacer employing the short balls and the spinner doing a holding job. But there were some loose deliveries as well, which Woakes and Smith put away for boundaries as they helped England past 300. To add to West Indies' problems, Shamar Joseph appeared to have some problems with his left hamstring while bowling and left the field. The England batters, meanwhile, continued untroubled as they extended the lead past 200.\n\nWest Indies took the second new ball as soon as it was available, with Jason Holder finding some movement. Smith, however, gave him the charge and played a drive wide of cover for a four while Woakes drove square off Seales for a boundary. But the partnership came to an end against the run of play as Woakes played an uppish flick straight to deep square leg to give Seales his third wicket. Holder found the outside edge of Atkinson's bat to leave England eight down. Smith then reached fifty, becoming the 10th England wicketkeeper to score 50-plus on Test debut as he helped England past 350.\n\nWith only two wickets remaining, Smith upped the ante as he struck sixes off Shamar and Seales. Shoaib Bashir did well to survive at the other end until a direct hit from Mikyle Louis found him short of the crease as he tried to get Smith back on strike. The wicketkeeper-batter struck a four off Seales before handing a catch in the deep as West Indies bowled England out late in the second session, after which early Tea was taken.\n\nEarlier in the first session, Joe Root started watchfully before Harry Brook got into the act with a crisp cover drive for four off Seales. A half-century stand was soon established as England crossed the 200 mark, with Brook executing a late cut to perfection off Alzarri. Root found his rhythm, hitting a pull and a cover drive for two fours off Seales. The lead surpassed 100, and Root continued to flourish with boundaries off Alzarri. The West Indies bowlers struggled with discipline and the pitch offered little assistance as England made good progress in the first hour.\n\nBrook struck the day's first six, pulling Shamar over the fence, and got to his eighth Test fifty, off only 55 balls, with a couple off Alzarri. But West Indies' persistence with short deliveries paid off when Alzarri induced a top edge, leading to Brook's dismissal and ending a 91-run fourth-wicket partnership. It was a good little period for West Indies as Ben Stokes fell soon after Root became the fourth half-centurion. The England captain was bowled by a delivery from Gudakesh Motie that turned in sharply, marking his fifth consecutive single-digit score. Smith and Root then put on a useful partnership, which ended with Root getting bowled by Motie just before Lunch.\n\nBrief scores: West Indies 121 trail England 371 (Zak Crawley 76, Jamie Smith 70, Joe Root 68, Ollie Pope 57, Harry Brook 50; Jayden Seales 4-77) by 250 runs.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cricbuzz.comhttps://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/600x400/i1/c515720/smith-struck-a-fifty-on-debut.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

His second six, thrashed over the roof of Tavern Stand and out of the ground, oozed confidence.\n\nIndeed, he only put a foot wrong right at the end of his stay - caught in the deep before last man James Anderson had faced a single delivery in what could be his final bat after 21 years of Test cricket.\n\nEngland were already on solid footing at the start of the day, 68 ahead on 189 for three. With sunny skies and serene batting conditions they made a lively start as Root and Brook piled on 42 in the first half-hour.\n\nAt one stage Root helped himself to four boundaries in nine deliveries, while Brook hammered Shamar Joseph for six over midwicket on his way to a 55-ball half-century. His enthusiasm got the better of him soon after, going for another big swipe against Alzarri Joseph and spraying a top edge straight into Josh Da Silva's gloves.\n\nThe end of the Yorkshire duo's 91-run stand briefly invigorated the tourists, who added two more wickets as left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie produced a pair of brilliant dismissals.\n\nThe arrival of the left-handed Ben Stokes allowed him to make use of the bowlers' footmarks and he did so in style, ripping one sharply out of the rough to take out middle stump.\n\nMotie had less to work with against the right-handers but still did enough to outfox a well-set Root on 68, sneaking one past the outside edge and into the top of off.\n\nSmith (left) celebrates his half-century\n\nThe lead was still spiralling though, with 104 runs in the morning session, and Smith getting off the mark in Test cricket by slapping a drag down past mid-on for four. Twelve of his first 16 runs came in boundaries but he was measured as he joined Woakes in a solid stand worth 52.\n\nHe came out of his shell when the lower order came in, showing an acceleration that Foakes struggled to find during his own tenure in the side. Stepping away and giving himself room to swing for the fences he added 28 off his last 30 balls.\n\nFor the West Indies there was a champagne moment in the field, Mikyle Louis running out Shoaib Bashir with an outstanding direct hit before celebrating deliriously with a sprint around the ground.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Foakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Foakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/11/16/wire-87207603-1720710153-161_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

England were also in a strong position at that time and the West Indies were in desperate need of a breakthrough. And Gudakesh Motie delivered for his team in style.\n\nAfter starting the over with two dot deliveries, he castled Root with a peach of a delivery. It was a full-length delivery on the off stump from the left-arm spinner and the former England skipper went for a drive. However, he failed to make any contact as the ball turned away a bit at the last moment, beating his outside edge before going on to hit the off stump. Root was seen smiling in disbelief as he walked back to the dressing room.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gudakesh Motie had also dismissed England skipper Ben Stokes with an absolute beauty. Just like Root, Stokes had gone for a drive as well but was beaten on the inside edge by a turning delivery.\n\nTalking about the game, England were on 320 for 6 at the time of writing this report. Debutant Jamie Smith and Chris Woakes were batting in the middle for the hosts.

The first game of the three-match series between the teams is underway at the Lord's Cricket Ground in London.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes didn't have a great outing with the bat in the ongoing Test against West Indies. The all-rounder came to bat on Day 2 of the match after a solid 90-run partnership between Joe Root and Harry Brook, both of them scored a half-century.\n\nIt was expected that Ben Stokes would take his team to big total and cash on the platform set by Harry Brook and Joe Root. But his stay at the crease was cut short by the brilliance of Gudakesh Motie, who bowled a peach of a delivery to make the batter look clueless.\n\nGudakesh Motie during the last ball of 55th over bowled a tossed-up ball on the footmarks outside off. The ball wasn't on the driving length as Ben Stokes got forward to drive and the bat-pad gap was found. He missed the ball and the middle stump was down.\n\nBen Stokes looked absolutely stunned as his mouth went into an \"O\" as he gave a startled expression and then nodded in appreciation at such a peach. Spinner Gudakesh Motie jumped and punched the air in delight.\n\nBen Stokes scored just runs off 11 balls and with his wicket, England lost their 5th wicket for 254 runs. They already have taken a lead of over 150 runs and would be hoping to extend it to completely outplay the West Indies out of the game in the ongoing first Test.\n\nEarlier with the ball, England bundled out West Indies for just 121 runs. Gus Atkinson took 7 wickets on debut. After that with the bat, Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (59) slammed half-centuries before Harry Brook (50) and Joe Root (68) chipped in as well.\n\nJoe Root, who was looking pleasing to the eyes, was removed by Gudakesh Motie, who yet came up with a peach of the delivery to send the batter packing. He removed the batter just at the stroke of lunch and made sure he helped his team end the session on high.\n\nGudakesh Motie bowled went wide of the crease and fired in the full delivery to the off stump. The ball pitched and held its line. England batter Joe Root went for the drive and missed, the ball misses the outside edge and pegs back the off-stump.\n\nJoe Root was beaten by the pace of the ball along with the angle from where it was delivered. The batter ended with innings of 68 runs off 114 balls and also slammed 11 fours in his innings.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/GudakeshMotiecastlesBenStokes.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

With sunny skies and serene batting conditions they made a lively start as Root and Brook piled on 42 in the first half-hour.\n\nAt one stage Root helped himself to four boundaries in nine deliveries, while Brook hammered Shamar Joseph for six over midwicket on his way to a 55-ball half-century. His enthusiasm got the better of him soon after, going for another big swipe against Alzarri Joseph and spraying a top edge straight into Josh Da Silva's gloves.\n\nThe end of the Yorkshire duo's 91-run stand briefly invigorated the tourists, who added two more wickets as left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie produced a pair of brilliant dismissals.\n\nThe arrival of the left-handed Ben Stokes allowed him to make use of the bowlers' footmarks and he did so in style, ripping one sharply out of the rough to take out middle stump.\n\nMotie had less to work with against the right-handers but still did enough to outfox a well-set Root on 68, sneaking one past the outside edge and into the top of off.\n\nHe came out of his shell when the lower order came in, showing an acceleration that Foakes struggled to find during his own tenure in the side. Stepping away and giving himself room to swing for the fences he added 28 off his last 30 balls.\n\nFor the West Indies there was a champagne moment in the field, Mikyle Louis running out Shoaib Bashir with an outstanding direct hit before celebrating deliriously with a sprint around the ground.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Foakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Foakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38573769.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Motie delivered an exceptional delivery, a snorter that crashed into Stokes' middle stump, leaving him stunned at the precision and skill displayed by the spinner.\n\nEngland started the second day with a commanding performance spearheaded by Harry Brook and Joe Root. Their partnership flourished, pushing England to a strong position of 241/3 after 50 overs, securing a significant lead of 120 runs. Brook's innings was particularly noteworthy, showcasing his skill with a well-crafted 50 off 64 deliveries before succumbing to a sharp bouncer from Alzarri Joseph in the 51st over.\n\nHowever, England's momentum suffered a setback as captain Stokes took the crease, only to be swiftly dismissed by a masterful delivery from Motie. On the final ball of the 55th over, Motie produced a masterclass delivery to the left-handed Stokes. Pitching outside off and gripping the footmarks, the ball sharply turned back in towards the stumps. Stokes, leaning forward to drive, was left astounded as the delivery beat his inside edge with precision, crashing into middle stump.\n\nInitially displaying a mix of awe and disbelief, Stokes lingered briefly at the crease before disappointment set in, realizing the impact of Motie's delivery on his innings. His dismissal, adding just four runs in eleven deliveries to his recent struggles, underscored a challenging phase in his batting form. Meanwhile, Motie's teammates erupted in jubilation, celebrating his exceptional execution that bolstered West Indies' dominant position in the match.

Smith scored 70 on Day 2 of the first Test between England and West Indies at Lord's. Smith came to the crease when England were 254/5 following the dismissal of Ben Stokes. He shared a 33-run stand alongside Joe Root and another 52-run partnership with Chris Woakes. England scored 371/10, taking a 250-run lead.\n\nSmith showed a lot of composure and finesse on his debut. It was a knock of character from the number seven batter, who was one of the five half-centurions for England in their first innings. What stood out for Smith was his application in batting with the tail. When Woakes was out, England were 339/7. Smith single-handedly took them to 371.\n\nSmith completes 3,500 FC runs\n\nSmith's 70 was laced with eight fours and two sixes. He faced 119 deliveries. Jayden Seales dismissed Smith, who pulled a short ball toward deep square leg where the fielder dived forward and took a low catch. As per ESPNcricinfo, Smith has surpassed 3,500 runs in First-Class cricket. He owns 3,504 runs from 60 matches (90 innings). He struck his 15th fifty (100s: 14).", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rajdeep_saha@newsbytesapp.com", "name": "Rajdeep Saha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Collage", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Collage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l85720240711200824.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724706", "eventUri": "eng-9724706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 231272784, "title": "Lots of July 4 fireworks in San Jose but not downtown this year", "text": "If you\u2019re already making your plans to watch fireworks in San Jose for July 4, you\u2019ve got a few options to choose from, including pyrotechnic displays at Lake Cunningham Park, Almaden Lake Park and Excite Ballpark. However, that list doesn\u2019t include a show at Discovery Meadow Park in downtown San Jose this year. The Rotary Club of San Jose, which brought back the downtown fireworks in 2014, decided instead this year to sponsor the San Jose Giants\u2019 two-day celebration, which includes fireworks on both July 3 and 4. The rockets will go off July 3 after the Giants\u2019 game against the Stockton Ports, and on July 4 the fireworks will follow a concert by country music artist Matt Stell, presented by Bay Country. Tickets are on sale for both nights at sjgiants.com. Heather Lerner, incoming president of the San Jose Rotary Club, said she\u2019s excited about expanding the fireworks show to give families a safe way to celebrate the holiday. And moving the bombs bursting in air away from the San Jose Mineta International Airport flight path means air traffic won\u2019t need to be shut down during the show, either. \u201cNot just one night, but two, of even bigger pyrotechnic displays that simply were not possible at our previous location,\u201d Lerner said. (In the interest of full disclosure, I\u2019m also a member of the Rotary Club of San Jose.) For July 4, Alma Avenue will be closed between Senter Road and 10th street so people can watch without having to buy a ticket to the concert. San Jose Giants General Manager Ben Taylor says both nights should be \u201cunforgettable events\u201d whether you\u2019re watching from inside or out. Of course, San Jose residents looking for a more natural setting than a street or a baseball stadium on the Fourth can still head to Almaden Lake Regional Park, which has its ninth annual festival starting at 3 p.m. July 4 with live music, food trucks and a fun zone for kids before the fireworks start around 9:15 p.m. San Jose Councilmember Domingo Candelas also is hosting a fireworks show at Lake Cunningham Park in East San Jose for the first time. Those festivities start at 7 p.m. and also will feature food trucks and family-friendly activities. FAST COMPANY: If you\u2019re in the mountain and coastal towns of Boulder Creek, Ben Lomond, Felton, Pescadero and La Honda this Sunday, you might catch a glimpse of the Santa Clara Valley Model T Ford Club\u2019s 53rd annual Endurance Run and Lowland Tour. While it\u2019s not unusual to see vintage vehicles on summer weekends, this time it\u2019s a collection of historic \u201cSpeedsters\u201d \u2014 cars more than a century old that were modified to show off what then-new car companies could produce. You might catch them at lunchtime \u2014 around 11 a.m. until about 12:30 p.m. \u2014 at Arcangeli\u2019s Grocery in Pescadero, and they\u2019ll head back to the VA Medical Center in Palo Alto around 2 p.m. LOS GATOS TUNES: With (Mountain) Charley\u2019s gone, where can you hear some music in the City of the Cats these days? Glad you asked. Los Gatos Music and Arts has some tuneful events coming up, and best of all they\u2019re free to attend. First up is \u201cThe Sounds of Summer,\u201d an all-day affair June 22 at Los Gatos Town Plaza that showcases Bluegrass and American Roots music. Bring a picnic basket and your lawn chair (or purchase reserved seating). The music starts at noon and goes until dark with a lineup that includes the zydeco- and Cajun-flavored California Blue Runners, the Goat Hill Girls, the Wildcat Mountain Ramblers and zydeco bluesman Andre Thierry. Then on Wednesdays starting June 26, the annual Jazz on the Plazz series kicks off at the Los Gatos Town Plaza with Le Jazz Hot Quartet, starting at 6:30 p.m. Future shows include Jessica Johnson (July 3), Kim Nalley Trio (July 10) and Nicolas Bearde (July 31). You can boogie on over to jazzontheplazz.com to check out the full lineup. \u2018STEM\u2019 ORCHARDS: The Los Altos History Museum\u2019s Apricot STEM Fair is coming up June 29. If you haven\u2019t been before, it\u2019s a fun exploration of hands-on science and technology activities that emphasizes how people \u2014 and apricots \u2014 made their way to the Santa Clara Valley (and where they might go from here). The museum\u2019s courtyard will be buzzing with activities like egg-drop experiments, rocket launches and simulations of Mars colonization on the engineering and tech side. On the agriculture side, there\u2019ll be apricot-themed games and demos of sun drying the \u2018cots, as well as walking tours of the Los Altos Heritage Orchard. \u201cThe Apricot STEM Fair is an opportunity for all ages to delve into the history of this area, especially given its rapid evolution, while connecting with the local community through engaging and fun activities,\u201d Lillie Moore, the education and volunteer coordinator, said. Admission is $10, but it\u2019s free for kids 12 and under and museum members.

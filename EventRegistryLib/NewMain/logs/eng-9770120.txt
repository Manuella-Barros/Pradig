On the evidence presented on the lake about 30km east of Paris this morning, that could soon become two.\n\nFor many, they are the Irish medal bankers of the Games, given their dictatorial dominance of this domain in recent years. But surviving at these altitudes is easier said than done, and they'll know just how many others are lining up to knock their off their perch. The Italian and Swiss crews look most capable of doing so.\n\nBy halfway in their heat, they had pulled a half-length clear of Norway and it was in the third quarter that they truly asserted their supremacy, bidding adieu to their rivals and slicing along the water to hit the finish in 6:34.12, over seconds clear of Norway.\n\nAfter the finish O'Donovan looked to the Irish fans in the stands as he gathered his breath, raising his arms. This had taken precious little out of one of Ireland's sporting greats.\n\nThey will return for their semi-final on Wednesday and, assuming all goes to plan there, Friday will be their date with destiny - a chance for O'Donovan to become the most successful Irish male Olympian of all time and the first Olympian to win medals at three separate Games.\n\nElsewhere it was a strong morning for Ireland, with Aifric Keogh and Fiona Murtagh powering into the semi-finals of the women's pair after finishing second in their heat in 7:28.22 behind Romania (7:24.22), the duo overhauling Czechia in the final metres to take the runner-up spot.

The Swiss crew, who had finished fractionally in front of the Irish pair in a World Cup race earlier this year, were more than a boat length behind in second.\n\nIt was a statement performance from the defending Olympic champions. The first half of their year was disrupted by illness to McCarthy, who had very little training done when they were beaten in a World Cup race in Lucerne. All of that is long behind them now and they looked incredibly strong on the water on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn the men's pair semi-final, Ross Corrigan and Nathan Timoney produced a gutsy performance to qualify for the final in third place. The Irish crew held off the persistent challenge of the New Zealand pair, both of whom had won gold medals in Tokyo as part of the New Zealand eight. Corrigan and Timoney are the first Irish heavyweight pair to compete at the Olympics since 1980, and just the second ever.\n\nThe Fermanagh duo went hard at the start and were in front at the 500 metre marker. By halfway, though, they had slipped to second and with 500 metres to go they were down to third, less than two seconds clear of New Zealand. But Corrigan and McCarthy increased their stroke rate to 44 strokes a minute in the sprint for the line and New Zealand failed to close them down.\n\nCremen and Casey were terrific in the semi-final of the women's lightweight pair as well, beating off the French crew in the final 200 metres and qualifying for the final in third place. It was clear from early in the race that the qualifying places would lie between four boats, and Ireland were in fourth after 1,000 metres and 1,500 metres.\n\nFrance and Greece were the boats just ahead of them and with a huge home crowd roaring them home it looked like a tall order. But in the final sprint France cracked and the Irish crew were stronger. At the line Cremen and Casey were 3.5 seconds ahead of the French crew.\n\nIn the women's pair, however, Aifric Keogh and Fiona Murtagh could not find anything and trailed in last in their semi-final.

Gavin Cooney reports from the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Paris\n\nAND SO THE world turns, the sun rises, and Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy ease through an Olympic regatta. The Skibbereen duo are the defending champions and remain the boat to beat in Paris, and their opening heat was another pacific rout atop the water. The Norwegian boat hung around gamely before they too were defeated by the brutal attrition of Ireland's strokes, beaten by more than seven seconds.\n\nIt was another utterly dominant outing, though don't tell that to Paul O'Donovan.\n\n\"If you look at the seeding list we are way down on it this time\", O'Donovan told the media after their heat.\n\n\"I can't even count how many names are above us. Maybe that is down to the lack of my counting abilities, and I forgot my abacus but the pressure is on everyone else here. We are just here to enjoy ourselves, do the best we can and take a few of the big scalps all going well.\"\n\nBut Paul, are you guys not the biggest scalp going?\n\n\"We've not heard that talk at all. As I was saying we are seeded way down the list. People are delusional if they are having that talk at the minute. We have belief in ourselves that we can come out on top. That's what we are looking forward to trying to do.\"\n\nO'Donovan and McCarthy are third seeds, behind the Italians and the Swiss, both of whom beat Ireland at their final major race prior to the Olympics. But that was treated in the rowing world as a black swan event, given the Irish duo have won two world golds and two European golds since they won Olympic gold in Tokyo.\n\n\"We've shifted the target onto the big guns in the event\", added Fintan.\n\n\"And what's happened is we've kind of shifted it without them realising\", chimed Paul, \"so it's after taking them by surprise now. And they're kind of getting worried, is the feeling around the boat park. Being the favourites, they're not used to it.\"\n\nSo perhaps this is all a grand psychological play to keep motivated for another Olympic tilt; a kind of Yerrah on the Water. Or perhaps O'Donovan was simply keeping himself entertained while he had to spend a few minutes standing around, talking to us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, his brilliance is such was that it wasn't very convincing. Plus, Fintan grinned and suppressed a few sniggers as he Paul was talking.\n\nBut this all media frippery at the end of the day: O'Donovan and McCarthy's sole concern will be their semi-final on Wednesday morning, in which they'll likely get a close-up look at either the Italians or the Swiss.\n\nTheir cruise came at the end of a positive morning on the water for Ireland, during which Ross Corrigan and Nathan Timoney burnished their medal prospects in the men's pair.\n\nThey finished third in their heat in a dramatic photo finish, sneaking into the semi-final without needing the repechage, edging out reigning world champions Switzerland, beaten by New Zealand and Spain.\n\n\"We're delighted to get a race put down on the track\", said Corrigan. \"For me anyway, that's nearly the most nervous one. It's been April since we raced together, and we didn't have a great regatta. A bit of injury, a bit of sickness before too.\n\n\"No different to ourselves people have stepped on since the last time we raced. Like the Kiwis, we beat them handy enough in Lucerne, but they've stepped on since and a few combination changes.\n\n\"I didn't realise we were fighting for the top three for the last 200 metres. I realised the Kiwis were in the mix and I said, 'God, we've got to get a move on here.'\n\n\"I knew the Swiss were falling back. I knew a 100 or so metres before the line that we were up on them. Coaches don't like to see you looking out so much, they like to see you focused and keep a bit internal.\n\n\"It's very different from the world championships. Usually at a world championships, the first race, I don't want to say it's easy, but compared to that it's easy.\n\n\"This is more like a semi-final of a world championships, even trying to get into a semi-final here.\"\n\nNathan Timoney and Ross Corrigan. Morgan Treacy / INPHO Morgan Treacy / INPHO / INPHO\n\nThey will race in the semi-finals next Wednesday, as will Aifric Keogh and Fiona Murtagh. Both were part of the bronze-winning quarter in Tokyo but have now downsized to compete in the women's pair. Needing only to avoid finishing fourth in a four-boat heat, the Irish crew summoned a startling finish to nab second place ahead of the Czechs by all of one hundredth of a second. Romania won comfortably by four seconds.\n\n\"We didn't really know what was going on to our left\", said Keogh. \"GB were right beside us so we could kind of feed off them a little bit. I was happy enough with how we were tracking against them. I saw them make a bit of a move then obviously towards the end and again I think we responded quite well.\"\n\nBut in making the medal case for a medal for the duo later this week, the heat's evidence was thin. Romania were flagged as medal contenders ahead of the Games and they finished a comfortable four seconds of the Irish, while, for what it's worth, Ireland's time wouldn't have been enough to avoid a repechage in either of the other heats. The Dutch and Australian crews are the medal favourites, and both easily won their respective heats.\n\n\"We've just come off a really hard couple of weeks of training and the body is still in that kind of shock of training so hard\", said Murtagh. \"You don't want to necessarily feel good straight away, you don't want to peak too soon. So we're confident in ourselves in how we're feeling at the moment and how we're going to feel over the next couple of days.\"\n\nThe rest of the Irish crews on the water today must instead rely on the back-door repechage to the next round. The women's lightweight double of Aoife Casey and Margaret Cremin finished third in their heat behind gold medal favourites GB, and Greece. They must race again, at 10am tomorrow morning, to force their way into the semi-finals.\n\nThe women's four, meanwhile lagged a distant third in their heat, finishing seven seconds from the top-two spot they needed to book a spot in the final. Their repechage is on Tuesday morning, in which they'll have to finish in the top two to race for a medal on Thursday.\n\nO'Donovan and McCarthy are, barring something utterly unforseen, a lock to return for their final on Friday morning, underdog act notwithstanding.\n\nBut then again, it makes sense that they've painted targets on the backs of their opponents.\n\nFor only in rowing can you see their backs when you're winning.", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_cooney@the42.ie", "name": "Gavin Cooney", "type": "author",

This number was then averaged across all 200.\n\nThe first 200 runners to break the 4-minute mile spanned a period of 20 years from 1954 to 1974. They came from 28 different countries across Europe (88), North America (78), Oceania (22) and Africa (12).\n\nThey were born between 1928 to 1955, and were aged 23, on average, when they ran the mile in under 4 minutes, with times ranging between 3:52.86 and 3:59.9 minutes.\n\nOf the total, 60 (30%) had died and 140 were alive at the time of the analysis. The average age at death was 73, but ranged from 24 to 91, while the average age of the surviving runners was 77, ranging from 68 to 93.\n\nInformation on cause of death wasn't known for most of the athletes, but of the seven who died before the age of 55, six were due to trauma or suicide and one was due to pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the under 4-minute milers lived nearly 5 years beyond their predicted life expectancy, on average, based on sex, age, year of birth, age at achievement, and nationality.\n\nWhen factoring in the decade of completion, those whose first successful attempt was in the 1950s, lived an average of 9 years longer than the general population during an average tracking period of 67 years.\n\nAnd those whose first successful attempt was in the 1960s and 1970s lived 5.5 years and nearly 3 years longer during an average tracking period of 58 and 51 years, respectively.\n\nGeneral improvements in life expectancy secondary to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of several major diseases might explain this particular trend, suggest the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that they didn't have any information on the lifelong exercise habits (or other health behaviours) of the 200 athletes included in the study, so weren't able to determine the precise relationship between lifelong exercise dose and longevity.\n\nAnd comparison against the general population precluded assessment of how other lifestyle factors, such as diet and smoking, cardiometabolic risk factors, and other potentially influential medical factors, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, might affect longevity. Finally, the study included only men as no woman has yet to run a mile in under 4 minutes.\n\nNevertheless, they say: \"This finding challenges the upper ends of the U-shaped exercise hypothesis (as it relates to longevity) and, once again, reiterates the benefits of exercise on the lifespan, even at the levels of training required for elite performance.\"\n\nAlthough the effort required in this group might seem to be less than that of endurance athletes, the high aerobic and anaerobic requirements of middle distance events, such as the mile, necessitate putting in relatively high training volumes of around 9-12 hours or 120-170 km a week, they explain.\n\nWhile all this raises the possibility of pushing the body beyond its limits, particularly from an intensity perspective, this doesn't seem to affect lifespan, and if anything seems to prolong it, they add.\n\nThe physiological explanations for the extended lifespan are yet to be fully identified, say the researchers, but suggest that these likely reflect the positive adaptations of endurance exercise on cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune-related health and function.\n\nA healthy lifestyle and genes may also have a role, they point out, as 20 sets of brothers, including six sets of twins and father and son combinations, were among the first 200 runners to break the 4-minute mile.\n\n/Public Release.

He died in 2018, at the age of 88.\n\nSir Bannister, pictured here at age 75, posing with the stopwatch that measured his record breaking mile.\n\nTheir theory is that the tremendous stress that extreme athletes put their bodies can cause heart problems and lead to an earlier death, Dr Foulkes told DailyMail.com.\n\nTheir results were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\nOnly a few thousand people in the world have ever recorded a time that quick, but the researchers said this is evidence that whatever form of exercise you want to get may be beneficial for your body.\n\nThere's been a lot of emphasis on slow and steady exercise - as is evidenced by the 10,000 steps a day camp. But Foulke's research shows that extreme exercise may even be more beneficial to our bodies.\n\n'The beauty of exercises is that it's a stress, but it's a stress that our body is really designed to deal with and adapt and grow stronger from,' he said.\n\nWe can see this by looking back in history. Sir Roger Bannister became the first known person to run a mile in under four minutes in May 1954.\n\nSince then, 1,754 other men have broken that same boundary, according to the Sub-4 Chronicle, which was the database used in the study. The most runners come from the US, Great Britain and Kenya.\n\nThe researchers looked at 200 of the under four-minute-milers who hit their record from 1954 to 1974 so that they could see how these miraculous athletes fared as they aged. 30 percent of the men had died by the time the study began.\n\nBut overall, the researchers found that the runners lived on average four years and eight months years longer than people their age who did not complete a sub four mile.\n\nThis is probably because extreme athletes get some of the same benefits from exercise that normal people do, Dr Foulkes said.\n\nRunning can help lubricate blood flow, keep your heart strong, support your immune system in fighting of cancer, and help you dodge lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity.\n\nPeople who ran a sub-four mile lived on average 4 years and eight months longer than the average population.\n\nTo be able to run a sub-four, the athletes probably had to train between nine and 12 hours a week, the authors wrote.\n\nThough exercise recommendations vary widely, the CDC prescribes about an hour and 15 minutes of vigorous cardio weekly.\n\nSo it's safe to say that these men were exercising more than your average joe.\n\nIn these extreme exercise conditions, some science points to side effects.\n\nFor one, research has shown that right after a bout of extreme exercise - people's hearts release signs of being oxygen deprived and damaged, Dr Foulkes said.\n\nRead More Roger Bannister: Modest amateur who ran into the pages of sporting legend\n\n'When we look really closely at anyone after exercise, we can see some scary, scary looking things. But that's because exercise is a is a intense thing,' he explained, saying that exercise an intense thing our body can adapt to.\n\nFor another, Dr Foulkes cited a highly influential 2013 study that looked at how 17,000 Danish people aged. The Danish researchers found people who did gentle, regular jogging lived about five years longer than others in the cohort.\n\nBut the small set of people who had intense running routines had roughly same life expectancy as people who didn't exercise at all.\n\nThis, Dr Foulkes said, suggested that there might be a goldilocks zone of exercise. This is called the U-shaped hypothesis of exercise - if you do too little or too much then you'll die earlier than if you do a moderate amount.\n\nSubsequent research explained these differences by showing that exercising too much could stress your heart and circulatory system, Dr Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at the University of Queensland School of Medicine, and his colleagues wrote in a 2020 review.\n\nHowever, Dr Foulkes said, the u-shaped hypothesis of exercise is unproven. Papers like his add to the growing doubt that people who dedicate their life to extreme sports are harmed by it.\n\nOne massive 2022 study published in the journal Circulation found people who did more exercise than recommended had a 38 percent lower risk of developing heart disease.\n\nOne thing that all papers, no matter where they fall on the U-shaped hypothesis, agree with is that everyone can benefit from some exercise. And you don't need to be able to run a under four minute mile to get the benefits of exercise, Dr Foulkes said.\n\nRegular, moderate movement is enough, he said.\n\nDr Foulkes said exercise is 'really this, you know, multi-pill kind of medicine, so to speak. You know, they always say that if you could turn exercise into a pill that would it would be the best sold medicine or drug on the market.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bannister", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Bannister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alberta", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-minute_mile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-minute mile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lifestyle disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Queensland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jogging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/18/84669645-0-image-a-15_1715274901510.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555071", "eventUri": "eng-9555071", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 452991066, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 6, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 6}}}

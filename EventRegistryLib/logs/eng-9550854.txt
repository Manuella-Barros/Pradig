The Alabama head coach decided to step away from college football after 17 seasons and six national championships in Tuscaloosa. Saban has remained pretty busy since then, with his latest event being the Regions Tradition Pro-Am in Birmingham.\n\nAs fun as playing golf or appearing on ESPN has been for Saban, there are still aspects to coaching he already misses. One sticks out more than the others though, saying the relationships he can build with players mean more than anything. Saban still knows the majority of Alabama's roster but as the years pass, his players will be out of the program.\n\nBut just a few months in, he already misses connecting with those guys.\n\n\"Relationships with players,\" Saban said. \"I actually played golf with Mark Ingram and Tua (Tagovailoa). Had them up on Monday. Those relationships you have with players, man. There's nothing that beats that. But we care about them all. So, we're going to continue with the relationships.\"\n\nSaban says both Ingram and Tagovailoa hit the ball well, even citing the Miami Dolphins quarterback as a pretty good putter. Based on the famous stories of the basketball league, Tagovailoa is exactly the type of guy Saban would want in a scramble if playing in a tournament.\n\nIn the final years of his career, Saban began to really open up about some of the relationships he had with players. Seemingly every season, it was somebody new, and stories about funny moments with Saban, or what everyone meant to each other would be told to the media.\n\nSaban has spoken highly of the entire 2020 national championship-winning team, talking about the resilience required during COVID-19. From the time spring practice got shut down until the confetti fell from the sky in Miami.\n\nBryce Young and Will Anderson eventually took over as leaders. When they decided to play in the 2022 Sugar Bowl despite being draft-eligible and having nothing to play for, Saban was more than complimentary of those two.\n\nThis past season, Jalen Milroe grew a bond with Saban as the season went along. Even through the retirement announcement, the quarterback and coach remain close. Terrion Arnold is close with Miss Terry, virtually becoming a part of the Saban family.\n\nSaban will certainly keep up with all these guys, just not on the football field.

Saban still, however, spent a couple of minutes with local reporters before getting some swings in on the driving range, and almost four months into his retirement, he was asked what he misses most about being the head coach of the Crimson Tide.\n\n\"Relationships with players,\" Saban quickly responded. \"I actually played golf with Mark Ingram and Tua (Tagovailoa), I had them up on Monday and we played. Those relationships that you have with players, man, nothing beats that.

Below is everything else that he said.\n\nSaban on what it means to come back to the Regions Tradition Pro-Am...\n\n\"You know, this is one of my favorite events that we did each year. To be able to meet the players, see a lot of fans, sign a lot of autographs, make a lot of people feel good - I hope - and always enjoy playing golf.

I try to make people feel good, make them feel better. Nobody remembers anything you say, but they do remember how you make them feel. Hopefully, we can still make some people feel good.\"\n\nSaban on how he enjoyed covering the NFL draft for ESPN...\n\n\"I did enjoy it. It's a lot of preparation. I enjoy the team that we were with and got a lot of good direction, learned a lot. It's challenging, something new. But that's some of the stuff that we were looking forward to, and one of the things that I look forward to now is, since I'm one of you, I can ask the questions.\"\n\nSaban on who his preseason No. 1 team will be, now that he's an analyst...\n\n\"Oh, I haven't even thought about that yet. I'm gonna need to do a little research on that. There's gonna be a lot of good teams. It's interesting right now to try to figure out who's who because of the movement in players. Until that all settles down and you know exactly who's gonna play on what team, I think then you can make a little better judgment.\"\n\nHave you subscribed to BamaOnLine.com yet?

Tommy Tuberville and plenty of others in the college football world, Nick Saban took his golf game from his beautiful course at Jupiter Hills, Fla., to Birmingham.\n\nBut before teeing off Wednesday, Saban got in a practice round with former players Mark Ingram and Tua Tagovailoa at Jupiter Hills on Monday, according to an interview with WJOX this morning. Knowing how competitive Saban is, it's hard for the legendary coach to give out a compliment about the competition, but he tried his best.\n\n\"I had an interesting day on Monday. I invited Mark Ingram and Tua (Tagovailoa) to Jupiter Hills to play with me and another member, and we had a blast,\" Saban recalled about Monday's matchup. \"I mean, I got killed about the defense vs. the offense in practice. They hit it good, and Tua's a really good putter. They didn't play great. Jupiter Hills is a hard course if you've never played it before, but we had fun, it was great.\n\n\"Mark and I took on Tua and Burk Wyatt, who is the member. Of course we won.\"\n\nWould you expect anything different from Nick Saban? Even with local media attending the event, the former Alabama coach had a little fun with those gathered to ask questions. All that was missing was the coke and water bottle at the podium.\n\nNever the one to get sarcastic with the media, or just have a little fun at the expense of the ones who peppered him with questions during his tenure at Alabama, Saban was in a jolly mood as he prepared to tee-off this morning.\n\n\"Good to see you guys. Can't tell you how much I missed y'all,\" Saban jokingly said to media members. \"Really the only reason I came here was to see y'all.\"\n\nIf you haven't noticed by now, the former Alabama head coach is enjoying life outside the office and practice field. It's not as if the legendary coach has disappeared from the spotlight, whether it's a speaking engagement or doing an incredible job at the NFL Draft recently. But life is different, and Saban seems to be adjusting well in the retirement stage.\n\nAs for life over the next few months before the college football season arrives, Nick Saban is staying busy as he tries to help navigate the current landscape of this new era in collegiate sports. With so many questions to be answered on how we get to a potential point of revenue sharing with athletes, there's still a ways to go according to Saban.\n\n\"What happens in college football is really important to me, it's what i went through for fifty years,\" Nick Saban noted to WJOX. \"All my comments have been based on not the way players get what they get, but how they get it, so that we keep some type of competitive balance. This is a really complicated issue. The lawsuits, and how they get sorta settled, and how can we move forward from that. What kind of structure do we have, whether the players are employees or not employees. Are we profit sharing or not profit sharing. How do we deal with title nine, and what we do with non-revenue sports.\n\n\"My thing is that I'm hopeful we come up with a system that doesn't impact other sports. So we can continue to create opportunities for 400-500 kids and 82% of the kids in the Olympics get developed in college. So if you eliminate those opportunities, we're eliminating that development as well. I just think there's so much to be learned by sports that i think whatever the venue we create for these guys to succeed and have quality of life is going to enhance their chances of being more successful in life.\"\n\nAs for his golf game, that's one aspect of retirement that he's certainly trying to get better at. I don't think Nick Saban is taking many mulligans on the golf course. But, it's easy to notice how much more relaxed he has become in his days off the field, with his downtime being spent on the golf course.\n\nAccording to the legendary coach, his golf game hasn't flourished much with all of this extra practice time he's had over the past few months.\n\n\"No better than it was before. There's always something missing. You know golf is like a metaphor of life. You got a different shot, so you gotta deal with whatever comes next. One day the putting is not there, one day the chipping is not there, and then you can't hit it off the tee. So it's a challenge no doubt.\"\n\nAt least he's got a lot of time on his hands to fix those problems with his swing, along with saving the college football world.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trey_wallace@outkick.com", "name": "Trey Wallace", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jupiter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ingram_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Ingram II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJOX_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WJOX (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Tuberville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coke (fuel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1993090523.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He is an American sportscaster who coached football at the collegiate and professional levels. The 72 year old is married to Terry Saban for more than 50 years now.\n\nMeanwhile, he has adopted two kids, Kristen and Nicholas. Recenlty, the legendary Alabam coach's daughter caught up some controversy. Kristen seems to have received a lot of backlash after it was discovered on the internet that she had an alleged extramarital affair with ex-Bachelorette star James Taylor.\n\nTaylor posted a lengthy note explaining the whole situation on Instagram along with a picture of him kissing Kristen. He stated that he met Kristen, \"2 months ago I flew out to Birmingham to see Kristen Saban, yes Nick Saban's daughter. She picked me up and we drove to Tuscaloosa.\"\n\nHe further wrote that she told him she was \"she's still married and living with her husband. I was shocked and pissed that this wasn't made known to me before I came to visit.\"\n\nIt is not known what the truth is, but this made Kristen delete her social media accounts. She is married to Adam Setas since 2015, and the two have known each other for almost their entire lives. Yes! Since they were just five years old. The two got married in 2015 and have been going stronger ever since, maybe, until this contriversial news came out. Here is all you need to know about Adam Setas.\n\nAdam Setas is the husband of Kristen Saban who is the daughter of Nick Saban, the head coach of Alabama football. Between June 2003 and August 2009, and again between August 2012 and August 2013, Adam worked at his family business named Stan Setas Produce Companny LLC.\n\nAdam used to be a hockey player who played for the Lansing Catholic High School before he joined Alabama team as a freshman. He played in 66 games and recorded 23 points (seven goals, 16 assists) in his three seasons at Tuscaloosa.\n\nAfter graduating from Alabama, Setas worked as a Financial Operations Intern at Mercedes-Benz, an Equity Research Associate at Sterne Agee, and a Senior Analyst at Culverhouse Investment Management Group.\n\nAdam then got a job at the Financial Advisor for Merrill Lynch after they moved to Birmingham in 2014. While Adam's net worth isn't known Kristen is worth $500,000.\n\n33 year old Adam Setas is Kristen's childhood sweetheart and they live in Birmingham, Alabama, with their two children.\n\nAs discussed before, Adam Setas and Kristen Saban have known each other since they were five years old. The two later went on to date each other in 2013. The following year, Adam decided to take it further and asked her out. In 2015, the two officially got married to each other.\n\nThe two welcomed two kids together named Amelie Elizabeth and James.\n\nThe Setas family owns Stan Setas Produce Companny LLC, which is located in Lansing, Michigan, as per heavy.com.

A relief for Tigers' fans after Saban retired in January with a 12-5 record against Auburn as the Crimson Tide head coach.\n\nFreeze and Saban have had a longstanding relationship dating back to Freeze's coaching days at Ole Miss. But now that Saban has transitioned to retirement, their close friendship has changed a little bit according to Freeze, who spoke at the Regions Tradition Pro-Am in Birmingham on Wednesday.\n\n\"Nick and I were in Jupiter (FL) for spring break and played golf together, and we actually talk fairly regularly now and it's peaceful,\" Freeze said. \"Everybody knows I love Nick and we're really good friends away from the field and when we don't play each other.\"\n\nFreeze has spoken in depth about his friendship with Saban over the years, from vacationing with the Saban family to them being there in times of need. But on the field, the two are fierce competitors. With Saban getting the better of Freeze with a 4-2 record head-to-head against his friend. Highlighted by a two year stretch where Freeze had Saban's number as the Ole Miss head coach with two straight wins over the Crimson Tide in 2014 and 2015.\n\nBut now that Saban's retired, the only time the two are able to compete now is on the gold course, as Freeze was asked who won in their latest matchup on the links over spring break.\n\n\"Coach Saban can get it in the hole,\" Freeze admitted. :That was back in March when I hadn't been playing any and I think he got the best of me. But I look forward to a rematch now that I'm playing some.\"\n\nFreeze and Saban only faced off once as the head men in one of college football's most bitter rivalries, with Alabama pulling out an improbable 27-24 over Auburn in the Iron Bowl last season following a catching the game-winning touchdown on 4th-and-31 by Isaiah Bond with under a minute to play in Jordan-Hare Stadium. As Freeze will now gear up to play new Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer who was also in attendance for at the Regions Tradition this week.\n\n\"Kalen I've known for a while, I think he's a really good football coach and a good man.

Just over a month later on Jan. 10, Saban announced his retirement from coaching. A move you have to imagine was celebrated a bit in Athens.\n\nThe relationship between Saban and Smart has always been a good one. Alabama and Georgia have played in some of the most important games in recent times and there's no doubt they wanted to beat one another. But there has always been a respect between the two, something Smart says is still active as Saban moves into retirement.\n\n\"Nick's been great,\" Smart said. \"He's been wonderful for my career, he's a great man. He's a leader in college football. He continues to do that. Been very supportive of me and my family. Enjoyed it.\"\n\nSmart spent nine seasons in Tuscaloosa, beginning as the defensive backs coach in 2007. He was quickly promoted to defensive coordinator in 2008 and was part of one of the best runs in college football history with Alabama. Four of Smart's career national championships are with the Crimson Tide.\n\nTaking control of his alma mater was too good of an opportunity to pass up, though. Smart brought the standard Saban had set with him to Georgia and instantly became Alabama's biggest on-field rival when it came to competing for championships.\n\nFacing each other six times, Saban came out on top on five occasions. Four of them were SEC Championship games, while no Alabama fan will forget the 2017 national championship when DeVonta Smith scored a walk-off touchdown.\n\nSmart will have fond memories of his head-to-head win against Saban too, occurring in 2021 in Indianapolis for Georgia's first championship since 1980. It felt like the Bulldogs had finally slayed the beast, taking down somebody who haunted the program for years.\n\nThrough all the matchups, Saban and Smart have remained friends with one another. On-field matchups have not come in the way of their relationship, often seen smiling while talking during pregame warmups.\n\nWe will get our first taste of Alabama-Georgia without Saban on the sidelines this year. Smart will take his team to Tuscaloosa on Sept. 28 for a regular season matchup, the first between them since 2020. Georgia has not won at Bryant-Denny Stadium since Saban's first season in charge, 2007.\n\nKalen DeBoer is now on the other sideline, where the relationship between him and Smart is still in its infancy stages.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_mcveigh@on3.com", "name": "Griffin McVeigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SEC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVonta_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeVonta Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant\u2013Denny_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/05/30204053/kirby-smart-responds-statement-that-georgia-has-surpassed-alabama-nick-saban-top-program-college-foo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-08", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 61}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-10", "textStart": 173, "textEnd": 180}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-28", "textStart": 2191, "textEnd": 2199}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He will serve as a college football analyst for ESPN this fall, and cut his teeth last month during the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThis year will certainly be an adjustment for Saban, who had held coaching jobs continuously since 1973, when he began as a graduate assistant at his alma mater Kent State. However, it doesn't sound like he regrets the decision, although there is one aspect of the job that he says he misses most.\n\n\"Relationships with players,\" Saban told members of the media after playing in the Regions Tradition Pro-Am golf tournament. \"I actually played golf with Mark Ingram and Tua [Tagovailoa], had them up on Monday. Those relationships you have with players, man. There's nothing that beats that. But we care about them all, so we continue with the relationships.\"\n\nSaban is just weeks removed from the 2024 NFL Draft, his first big assignment as an ESPN analyst, and he was pretty impressive despite being new at the job. ESPN's Rece Davis, who will work with Saban this fall on College GameDay, came away very impressed.\n\n\"I thought he was sensational,\" Davis said on the Pat McAfee Show last week.\n\nSaban told ESPN that the biggest adjustment over the last few months has been to slow down after spending 50 years on the contant tight deadlines exist for elite college football coaches.\n\n\"The biggest change for me as a person is that I lived my whole life for the last 50 years being in a hurry,\" he said in March. \"It was, 'Hurry up to go here. Hurry up to go there. Don't be late for this meeting. You've got another meeting in an hour. What are you going to say to the staff? What are you going to say to the team?' I mean, it was just deadline after deadline after deadline. Even when I was driving to the lake to go on vacation, I'd be in a hurry, and for what? But that's just how you were built.\"\n\nWith his coaching career behind him, Saban's attention has turned to his business interests, his media career and, of course, his golf game.\n\nRelated: SEC Football: Post-Spring 2024 Power Rankings\n\nRelated: SEC Football: Biggest Needs For Every Team in the Spring Transfer Portal Window", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_lyons@postandcourier.com", "name": "Dan Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rece_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rece Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduate assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kent State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ingram_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Ingram II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_GameDay_(football_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College GameDay (football TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/f1/4f1236bf-03b0-5975-9e3b-4cfa3a6f3e83/663cf47604fee.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C18&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Nick found out about them because he called her on the way back to Birmingham, and I could hear him sounding upset.\"\n\nHe added that although It made him chuckle a bit as an Aggie, it also made him feel bad for Kristen because it was clear she cared deeply about her father and was saddened by the call.\n\nKristen Saban's side of the story might be quite different. Sources indicate that she has been separated from her husband, Adam Setas, for some time. In response to Taylor's claims, Kristen deleted her active X/formerly Twitter account.\n\nShe even posted a cryptic message on her Instagram stories, reading, \"Next time someone tries to bring you down, remember. Confidence is quiet, insecurity is loud.\"\n\nShortly after, she deleted her entire Instagram account, adding to the mystery surrounding her personal life.\n\nFor the unversed, Taylor is a country singer who's also known for appearing in the television show \"Bachelor.\" According to his official Instagram handle, which goes by the name @jamesmccoytaylor, he is an artist currently residing in Texas.\n\nThe 36 year old was born on May 27, 1987 in Katy, Texas and after going to the Texas A&M University, he completed a degree in public relations at Harding University.\n\nHe enjoys more than 125K followers on the picture-sharing platform Instagram, wherein he shares his daily life activities and his music/song posts with his fans and followers.\n\nAs per his official flow page, James McCoy Taylor is known for writing and singing \"The Trump Song\" titled \"Great Again\" and the conservative anthem \"Are You With Us or Not?\"\n\nHe began his career on Jojo's season of The Bachelorette. Since then, he's been touring across the United States, performing American music.\n\nThe situation took on a different tone when reportedly James McCoy Taylor's true motives came under scrutiny. The release of his new song, \"Drinking Disorder in Florida,\" coincided with his allegations against Kristen Saban.\n\nA deeper examination of the lyrics revealed references to a possible encounter with someone resembling Kristen, leading some to speculate that the entire controversy was manufactured to promote his new music.\n\nDespite the drama and speculation, it's clear that more context and perspectives are needed to understand what happened.\n\nKristen Saban's supporters believe that she deserves privacy and respect during this difficult time, and many are calling for a more cautious approach to reporting and sharing personal stories online.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harding_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harding University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katy, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Katy, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/High-Schooler-Sneaks-Past-Security-To-Bribe-Nick-Saban.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Saban, who just retired from coaching, has a unique view on the sport.\n\nWhile he's for NIL and the transfer portal, the legendary coach is of the mind there still needs to be some legislation in place. There is legislation in some states, but it's a gray area across the country.\n\nBasically, the goal should be to get a blanket rule set, however that happens, according to Saban.\n\n\"I don't know about the immediate future, but I think at least there's a lot of awareness now that we have some issues that may affect the competitive balance moving forward,\" Saban said on McElroy and Cubelic. \"And I do think a lot of people are listening, a lot of people are working on it. I do think we can, you know, make some progress. I think we have made progress. A: we have awareness now and then B: how do we solve the problems?\n\n\"But I think if there's not some kind of legislation that actually protects whoever runs college football, the NCAA, whoever it is, it's not some kind of legitimate legislation that protects them from litigation, because that's kind of how we got here, you know, through myriad lawsuits. And so, there has to be some protection so they can enforce their own rules, whatever we decide those rules are.\"\n\nAll the eyes are on football and basketball as well. But once you zoom out from the two main sports across college athletics, you have to worry about non-revenue sports.\n\nThere are multiple factors, as Saban suggested. For example, football or basketball might need to be highly competitive to support the non-revenue sports.\n\nNot to mention conference realignment impacts or can impact certain schools who aren't in the Big Ten or SEC. To a lesser extent, the Big 12 and ACC.\n\n\"And you know, there has to be some kind of way that we can treat the non revenue sports and Title IX, so that that's not an issue, you know, moving forward,\" Saban said. \"So it's really complicated, but I wish that there were more people out there that knew and I did read one article this week that talks about all the issues, you know, the lawsuits, and how that's going to impact financial stability across the board. And how we can continue to create the kind of resources that are going to help people be successful and still create the opportunities.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_kosko@on3.com", "name": "Nick Kosko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/09111116/USATSI_22545439-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

While he hasn't spoken to Saban since his retirement, he thinks the seven-time national champion reached his limit in a new era of college football.\n\n\"The two biggest changes, both of which helped drive Nick Saban into retirement, are transfer portal and NIL,\" Lundquist said, via Awful Announcing. \"These kids now [ask], 'How much are you gonna pay me?' Or 'If you don't pay me or if you don't guarantee I'm starting and pay me, I'm transferring. I'm going to Central Michigan.' And I think Nick has now said, 'Yeah, that drove me nuts.'\"\n\nSaban alluded to those factors playing a role in him stepping down. In March, he told ESPN's Chris Low that he questioned whether his approach \"doesn't work anymore\" in a new reality that made it more difficult to accomplish his coaching goals.\n\n\"I thought we could have a hell of a team next year, and then maybe 70 or 80 percent of the players you talk to, all they want to know is two things: What assurances do I have that I'm going to play because they're thinking about transferring, and how much are you going to pay me?\" Saban said. \"Our program here was always built on how much value can we create for your future and your personal development, academic success in graduating and developing an NFL career on the field.\"\n\nShortly after, he appeared at a Congressional roundtable to argue for NIL regulation and revenue sharing instead of a model that forces players and teams to operate through collectives. However, he later told Fox News that NIL was \"not at all\" the main reason he retired.\n\n\"I just never wanted to see the program go down, and I felt whether it was recruiting or hiring coaches and people wanting to know how long you're going to be there,\" Saban said. \"When you get to 72 years old, it gets harder and harder to promise people you're gonna be there for four or five more years.\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verne_Lundquist", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Verne Lundquist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Michigan_Chippewas_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Michigan Chippewas football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/f9/ef9bd631-1b3d-50a4-8402-143ff5ee2f91/663d02ca97d76.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C52&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

And on a recent McElroy and Cubelic in the Morning episode, legendary Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban entered the conversation.\n\nNow, the two cohosts did not have Saban pick a side in the debate; rather, they had him reveal an individual or two that he recruited to play football and opted for basketball instead. And to their surprise, the former Crimson Tide head man revealed one player who opted for basketball and later became a star in the NFL that he tried to recruit when he was the head coach of the Michigan State Spartans.\n\n\"When Michigan State won the national championship in basketball, we had (Antonio) Gates at Michigan State. He was going to play football and basketball [but] he left football and transferred and went to play basketball,\" said Saban.\n\n\"You know when we play him in San Diego... he puts his arm around me and said, 'Coach, you're right, man. Sticking with football was the right thing for me.'\"\n\nSaban attempted to recruit Gates following the Spartans' national championship victory in 2000. However, the future NFL great had other things in mind, such as he would commit to playing basketball at Eastern Michigan and later transfer to Kent State. Saban may not have gotten the best out of the gates at the collegiate level, but his advice to the former San Diego Chargers star tight end was right on the money, as Gates would finish his career as one of the best tight ends in Chargers' history.\n\nAlong with Gates, there was another individual who was actually enrolled at Michigan State during his head coaching tenure with the Spartans, and he attempted to convert from basketball to football. Spartan star guard Mateen Cleeves was so on Saban's radar. And the opportunity was there to have him suit up for the Michigan State football program. Unfortunately, the basketball program's success might have gotten in the way of that.\n\nMateen Cleeves was a great high school football player. He was the point guard on Michigan State's national championship team. And he was going to play both -- he was going to play his basketball the first year and then try to play both. He had so much success playing basketball that he never did get into football. But he was probably a guy who would have been kind of an Andre Risen-type of athlete at some position. He played quarterback in high school. He would have been a tremendous football player.\n\nSaban may have missed out on utilizing the talent of Gates and Cleeves at Michigan State, but he more than made up for it during his time at LSU and Alabama. Between the two SEC programs, he would go on to acquire countless individuals with serious talent that he helped elevate to the NFL. In fact, over his career, Saban has sent 52 players to the NFL as first-round draft picks.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_rudolph@on3.com", "name": "Justin Rudolph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_San_Diego_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the San Diego Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Michigan_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Michigan University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kent State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/08222721/USATSI_22482861-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

However, Georgia kept most of its roster intact for last year's Orange Bowl matchup against Florida State.\n\nThe Bulldogs were coming off of back-to-back national titles and were a win away from reaching the CFP again, before coming up just short in the SEC Championship Game against Alabama.\n\nStill, Georgia came ready to play against FSU, blasting the undermanned Seminoles 63-3.\n\nBulldogs head coach Kirby Smart recently joined McElroy & Cubelic in the Morning and shared why most of his players suited up for the Orange Bowl and showed up ready to play.\n\n\"Great leadership within our organization,\" Kirby Smart said. \"Coaches, top down, sold throughout the year that we were a team and a family. And that wasn't going to change based on the outcome of one game.\"\n\nFlorida State was no match for the Bulldogs after the Seminoles had numerous players skip the bowl game.\n\nGeorgia led 42-3 at the half in the thumping and finished the year strong following the disappointing loss to Alabama.\n\n\"I mean for us, it was about finishing, and our players, they wanted to play,\" Smart said. \"We've got a bunch of dudes that love football, and they wanted to go play. And they carried that torch, not me. And I'm very thankful they did.\"\n\nNick Saban took down Kirby Smart for the final time on Dec. 8 as Alabama won the SEC Championship to earn a spot in the College Football Playoff. Just over a month later, on Jan. 10, Saban announced his retirement from coaching. It was a move you have to imagine was celebrated a bit in Athens.\n\nThe relationship between Saban and Smart has always been a good one. Alabama and Georgia have played in some of the most important games in recent times, and there's no doubt they wanted to beat one another. But there has always been a respect between the two, something Smart says is still active as Saban moves into retirement.\n\n\"Nick's been great,\" Smart said. \"He's been wonderful for my career; he's a great man. He's a leader in college football. He continues to do that. Been very supportive of me and my family. Enjoyed it.\"\n\nSmart spent nine seasons in Tuscaloosa, beginning as the defensive backs coach in 2007. He was quickly promoted to defensive coordinator in 2008 and was part of one of the best runs in college football history with Alabama. Four of Smart's career national championships are with the Crimson Tide.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_connolly@on3.com", "name": "Matt Connolly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orange Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SEC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550854", "eventUri": "eng-9550854", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-08", "textStart": 1482, "textEnd": 1488}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-10", "textStart": 1601, "textEnd": 1608}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

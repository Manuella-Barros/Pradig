landslides at Papua New Guinea disaster site", "body": "Locals dig during search and rescue efforts at the site of a landslide in Papua New Guinea late last month\n\nPapua New Guinea authorities have warned there is a high risk of more landslides at the site of a recent deadly disaster, with government experts demanding the area be evacuated and declared a \"no-go-zone\".\n\nA draft internal report by Papua New Guinea's mining and geohazards department, obtained by AFP on Tuesday, warns that the highland community where hundreds are feared to have died on May 24 needs to be urgently cleared of people.\n\n\"This area has to be declared a no-go-zone,\" the report warns, citing a litany of risks from further landslips, teetering boulders and underground streams.\n\nStating that there is a \"high likelihood of further landslides to occur in the immediate future\", the report concludes that \"any access to the area should be restricted to experts\".\n\nRescue workers have already given up on finding any survivors in the 600 metre-long (1,970 feet) scar of soil, boulders and debris left by the landslide on Mount Mungalo, in central Papua New Guinea.\n\nBut 12 days after the disaster, locals are still digging through deep mud and hauling rocks in the hope of finding loved ones.\n\nNow, geologists and other government experts are warning the recovery efforts could provoke another landslide, and the relocation of villagers should be \"non-negotiable\".\n\nIn particular, there is concern that the use of recently arrived heavy machinery could topple boulders perched above.\n\n\"Movement or vibration from the machinery will set these boulders into motion,\" the report warns.\n\nLocal authorities estimate 7,849 people live in two wards hit by the disaster.\n\nAn order to move them on would be fraught.\n\nLocal customs place great importance on recovering the bodies, and the area is prone to inter-tribal violence.\n\nAny order to evacuate would be \"highly sensitive and complex\", according to Justine McMahon from CARE Papua New Guinea.\n\n\"Because not only of people's connection to country (land) but also because new people moving in has an impact on local dynamics,\" she said.\n\nInitial Papua New Guinea government estimates said as many as 2,000 people may have been buried last month, although local officials have more recently put the number in the hundreds.\n\nOnly nine bodies have been recovered, according to local health authorities.\n\nAid agencies have set up several tents around the landslide site to deliver first aid and food.\n\nBut full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the site's remote location, nearby tribal violence and landslide damage that has severed major road links.\n\nCARE's McMahon told AFP supplies were slowly making their way to the site, but concerns remained about ensuring access to clean and safe water.\n\n\"Water is a big concern because the landslide covered the communities' main water source,\" she said.\n\nPapua New Guinea is one of the world's most disaster-prone regions and landslides are extremely common in its highlands.\n\nThe government report, dated

of a recent deadly disaster, with government experts demanding the area be evacuated and declared a \"no-go-zone\".\n\nA draft internal report by Papua New Guinea's mining and geohazards department, obtained by AFP on Tuesday, warns that the highland community where hundreds are feared to have died on May 24 needs to be urgently cleared of people.\n\n\"This area has to be declared a no-go-zone,\" the report warns, citing a litany of risks from further landslips, teetering boulders and underground streams.\n\nStating that there is a \"high likelihood of further landslides to occur in the immediate future\", the report concludes that \"any access to the area should be restricted to experts\".\n\nRescue workers have already given up on finding any survivors in the 600 metre-long (1,970 feet) scar of soil, boulders and debris left by the landslide on Mount Mungalo, in central Papua New Guinea.\n\nBut 12 days after the disaster, locals are still digging through deep mud and hauling rocks in the hope of finding loved ones.\n\nNow, geologists and other government experts are warning the recovery efforts could provoke another landslide, and the relocation of villagers should be \"non-negotiable\".\n\nIn particular, there is concern that the use of recently arrived heavy machinery could topple boulders perched above.\n\n\"Movement or vibration from the machinery will set these boulders into motion,\" the report warns.\n\nLocal authorities estimate 7,849 people live in two wards hit by the disaster.\n\nAn order to move them on would be fraught.\n\nLocal customs place great importance on recovering the bodies, and the area is prone to inter-tribal violence.\n\nAny order to evacuate would be \"highly sensitive and complex\", according to Justine McMahon from CARE Papua New Guinea.\n\n\"Because not only of people's connection to country (land) but also because new people moving in has an impact on local dynamics,\" she said.\n\nInitial Papua New Guinea

But days after the incident, they seem to have lost hope. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" UNICEF Papua New Guinea's Niels Kraaier said in a statement. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\"\n\nPapua New Guinea is vulnerable to natural disasters such as landslides and earthquakes because of a host of reasons, including its geographical location and deforestation. However, climate change has worsened the situation in recent years.\n\nHere is a look at why Papua New Guinea witnesses frequent natural disasters, and how climate change is leading to more frequent landslides.\n\nBut first, what happened?\n\nThe Yambali village in Enga province was hit by a landslide around 3 am with boulders -- as big as shipping containers -- falling on buildings, homes, and at least one school.\n\nRescue efforts began immediately and videos posted on social media showed people frantically digging through the debris with makeshift tools. But the efforts were severely limited as \"rocks are still moving, the mountain is still crumbling, and we are seeing rock and debris pile up on what's already happened,\" Sandis Tsaka, the administrator of Enga Province, said in a statement on May 25, according to The New York Times.\n\nTill May 29 -- five days after the incident -- only six bodies had been recovered. With not much hope of finding any survivors, locals started to hold funeral ceremonies, collective events known locally as \"haus krai\", last week.\n\nWhy is Papua New Guinea vulnerable to landslides and earthquakes?\n\nThe main reason is the geographical location of the country. It sits on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' -- a string of hundreds of volcanoes and earthquake sites which run along the Pacific Ocean. The ring, which is a semicircle or horse shoe in shape, witnesses many earthquakes due to constant sliding past, colliding into, or moving above, or below each other of the tectonic plates.\n\nFrequent earthquakes also lead to a high number of landslide incidents in Papua New Guinea. For instance, in 2018, a large earthquake triggered many landslides across the region.\n\nOther factors like the country's mountainous terrain and tropical climate also contribute to more frequent landslides. Speaking to ABC News, Dave Petley, vice-chancellor of the University of Hull (UK) and an expert on landslides, said that \"heavy rain and storms lead to increased erosion, flooding, and higher tides, all of which raise the chance of dangerous rockfalls\".\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that Papua New Guinea lacks infrastructure and economic development to deal with natural disasters -- unlike other nations like Taiwan, Italy and Japan, which are also vulnerable to such disasters. As a result, death tolls are usually high when landslides or earthquakes take place in the country.\n\nBesides the aforementioned factors, deforestation and mining have also played a role in more landslides. As Papua New Guinea is the world's fifth largest exporter of palm oil, it is dominated by palm oil plantations, which have been cropped up in place of forests. The mining of \"gold, silver, nickel, copper, and cobalt.. and LNG operations have been taking place in areas where deadly landslides occurred in the past,\" according to the ABC News report.\n\nWhat is the role of climate change?\n\nMuch like the rest of the world, Papua New Guinea is also reeling from the adverse effects of climate change. The country has witnessed an increase in temperature of approximately 0.8-0.9 degree Celsius, as measured in the difference between average temperature in 1900-1917 and 2000-2017, according to a report by the United Nations. Consequently, extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to attribute the latest landslide to climate change, experts believe that the phenomenon contributed to the incident. Higher temperatures result in more evaporation of water, which enables the atmosphere to hold more moisture. In such a situation, storms can be more dangerous as they can cause a higher precipitation intensity. This is likely what happened in Papua New Guinea -- it has experienced heavy rainfall so far in 2024, which could have triggered the landslide.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister James Marape said, \"This year, we had extraordinary rainfall that has caused flooding in river areas, sea level rise in coastal areas, and landslips in a few areas... We have faced extraordinary weather patterns and changes from dryness to wetness\".", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But two small landslides over the previous couple of years, Shugar said, is \"a warning that maybe something bigger was going to happen.\"\n\nPapua New Guinea, with high rainfall, hilly terrain and frequent earthquakes, is prone to landslides. But the May 24 event made headlines around the world after authorities estimated that hundreds of people, perhaps even 2,000, were killed.\n\nSome experts have questioned the accuracy of the government's death-toll estimate based on the size of the landslide -- which covered about 22 acres -- and the fact that it struck a rural area rather than a densely populated city. Papua New Guinea hasn't had a reliable census for years, so it is difficult to determine the size of the local population with accuracy.\n\nOfficials with Papua New Guinea's National Disaster Centre couldn't be reached for comment on the death toll estimates and landslide monitoring efforts.\n\nThe disaster has put a renewed focus on efforts to better forecast when and where landslides might happen. At open-pit mines, where minerals are extracted from giant sloped pits in the ground, various tools such as ground-based radars or a laser-emitting sensor known as lidar are used to monitor the stability of slopes.\n\nBut such a detailed approach would be too costly to be deployed over wide areas, particularly in developing countries where landslides often hit. Researchers are now investigating other tools, such as satellite-based radars and machine learning, to make it easier to forecast future landslides across entire regions.\n\nAdding to the urgency: Many researchers expect climate change will lead to more-frequent landslides. They predict intense rainfall, a common trigger of landslides, will become more common. Warmer temperatures are thawing frozen soil called permafrost and melting glaciers, destabilizing the land. And more severe wildfires could contribute to increased deforestation, which takes away the vegetation that supports the soil.\n\nOne study from Chinese researchers concluded the average annual frequency of landslides triggered by extreme precipitation in an intermediate climate-change scenario is projected to increase by 7% in the three-decade period after 2030, compared with the 1971-to-2000 period.\n\nCountries most at risk for high casualties included China, Afghanistan and India -- all of which have mountainous areas where there have been deadly landslides in the past.\n\nRain is one possible culprit for last month's landslide. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape told his country's parliament on Wednesday that the nation has received extraordinary rainfall in the past year, leading to river flooding, sea-level rise in coastal areas and landslides.\n\nComplicating the relief effort is that the landslide struck an area that has been struggling with violence between tribal groups. Aid workers say people had sought refuge in the area where the landslide hit, swelling the population and adding to the uncertainty over the death toll.\n\n\"Our people in that village went to sleep for the last time, not knowing that they would breathe their last breath as they were sleeping peacefully,\" Marape said.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency, Unicef, estimated that about 7,850 people were affected by the disaster, and up to 150 structures were damaged. As of Saturday, nine bodies had been recovered, a U.N. official said. A separate U.N. analysis of satellite imagery counted 18 structures damaged or destroyed, and estimated that 2,000 people were living within 1.2 miles of the landslide.\n\nThe area was buried under as much as 26 feet of soil and debris, U.N. officials say. With more bodies potentially under the rubble, some feared that underground water flowing down the mountain would contaminate local drinking water. The land was still shifting, threatening rescue workers. And the landslide blocked a road to a town further inland, cutting the area off and raising fears of a food shortage.\n\nJustine McMahon, the Papua New Guinea country director for aid group CARE International, said there is almost no sign that a village ever existed.\n\n\"We believe that there are some survivors who were scared and have run into the bush for safety,\" she said. \"The population is traumatized, particularly the children. And many of the children have stopped talking because of what they saw and what they experienced.\"\n\nCressida Kuala, a women's rights and environmental activist from the same province as the disaster, said people affected by the landslide need medical assistance, food and help to dig out the remains of their loved ones. Kuala, who said she passed through the village shortly before the landslide, said locals would sell goods along the road and there was a guesthouse nearby.\n\nA multitude of variables influence whether landslides occur, making them difficult to predict. Events that trigger landslides, such as rainfall and earthquakes, aren't easy to forecast. How a particular slope will behave is tied to material underneath the surface, which can be several layers of different rocks and soil.\n\n\"We can't see everywhere,\" said Pierre Rognon, an associate professor at the University of Sydney who studies soil mechanics. \"There will always be some uncertainty about what the slope is made of.\"\n\nThat means scientists need all the help they can get. Using deep learning, a type of machine learning that mimics the human brain, Italian scientists have shown that landslides can be anticipated accurately using only rainfall data. And at the University of Melbourne, researchers say they have developed an artificial-intelligence platform that can sift through massive amounts of data collected from satellite-based radars that measure ground deformation, and then predict the location of an impending landslide.\n\nTheir 2022 study looked at data tied to a landslide in China and volcano rockfalls in Italy and determined their tool would have shown where the events would occur. For the China landslide, which hit a village in Sichuan province in 2017 and left dozens dead or missing, the tool predicted the location of the disaster almost one year in advance, the study said.\n\nBut satellite-based radars have a drawback -- they can have difficulty detecting land changes in areas of dense vegetation. The exact timing of a landslide can also be hard to determine, though once a location is known, scientists can use other tools for a more detailed analysis into when a landslide will occur.\n\n\"You can have two slopes of equal levels of instability, but if one gets hit by a heavy rainfall tonight, that one will be more predisposed to collapse,\" said Antoinette Tordesillas, a professor at the University of Melbourne's School of Mathematics and Statistics, and an author of the 2022 study.\n\nThere are already localized warning systems in some places where it is known there is a high landfall risk. In Hong Kong, which also has hilly terrain and intense rainfall, authorities use a combination of real-time rainfall data, weather forecasts and radars that track clouds to determine whether to issue landslide warnings.\n\nEach rain gauge consists of a tipping bucket rainfall measuring unit and a data logger powered by solar energy, and information is beamed to cloud servers via mobile phone networks at one-minute intervals, according to information published by Hong Kong's civil-engineering department. Though the city averages about 300 landslides a year, the last landslide fatality was in 2008.\n\nFor scientists, deciding whether locals should be evacuated isn't always clear-cut. In one situation in Norway, nearby residents were evacuated more than a dozen times over several years before a rock slope gave way in 2019.\n\n\"The ground is very, very complicated, so it isn't unusual to see the slope accelerating and looking really dangerous, and then stopping or slowing down,\" said Dave Petley, a landslide expert and the vice chancellor at the University of Hull in England. \"As a scientist in that situation, you're really having a big impact on people's lives.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Then a sudden landslide levelled a village.\n\nEddlyn Yaki and her husband Toby were sleeping in their home in Papua New Guinea's Enga province when the sound of a large crack tore through their room, waking them suddenly.\n\nIt was 2am and the couple feared something terrible had happened.\n\nThey got out of their beds and rushed to a nearby pub to see if anyone knew what had caused the almighty sound.\n\nBut before they could find answers, tragedy struck.\n\nBecause that crack may have been the first sign of the avalanche of stone that would forge a destructive path towards the village below.\n\nEddlyn couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nShe asked Toby to get their children and bring them to a relative's house for the night, but he said he was cold and wanted to go home to sleep.\n\nIt was the last time she saw him alive.\n\nAfter parting ways, Eddlyn arrived at the pub to discover everyone had fled.\n\nThey scattered in all directions as the boulders tumbled down, while she took shelter at a nearby health clinic until the next morning.\n\nAs the sun rose over her village, she realised her husband, three children and father had all been killed.\n\n\"In the morning, I came back and saw that the stones had covered the area,\" she said.\n\n\"The ones who fled were told to check for their families.\n\n\"But my family didn't come out.\"\n\nOn Sunday, a funeral for five locals killed in the tragedy was held on the picturesque side of a nearby mountain.\n\nEddlyn's father was among those laid to rest.\n\nMen dug through the earth to create graves in the hot sun, while women sat on the ground and held each other.\n\nThe group sang traditional mourning songs, the haunting notes reverberating through the valley.\n\nNow, Eddlyn wonders what the future holds for her with her family gone.\n\nIn Mulitaka, land is passed down from fathers to sons and is rarely bought or sold.\n\nWith many buildings now buried under rock and debris, locals left homeless by the disaster don't know if they will be able to resettle.\n\nEddlyn has been staying at a care centre set up for refugees about 500 metres from the landslide site.\n\nWhile she's grateful for the aid that is being provided, she knows it won't last forever.\n\n\"What sort of help will they give me? Where will I be settled?\" she said.\n\n\"I need to know this because I lost my entire family. I am the only survivor.\"\n\nAs she and others bury their dead and recover from what could be the worst landslide in the island's history, they are plagued by unanswered questions about the landslide.\n\nThere is uncertainty over what they will do and where they will go, along with confusion about how this happened.\n\nBut what is most concerning to those at the centre of the tragedy is the very real risk it could happen again.\n\nPapua New Guinea is only 150 kilometres away from Australia's mainland.\n\nIn the country's centre, the Highlands sits along a mountainous spine that stretches from west to east, dissecting the Momase from the southern regions.\n\nSlightly to the north lies the rugged Enga Province, a resource-rich parcel of land pockmarked by sharp peaks and steep troughs.\n\nAt Enga's centre is Yambali village, which is also known as Maip, one of many communities in the Maip Mulitaka government area.\n\nAnd this green shape shows the scale of the avalanche of boulders, debris and soil that moved towards it.\n\nA draft internal report by Papua New Guinea's mining and geohazards department, obtained by the ABC, identifies some of the elements that likely played a role in the Yambali landslide.\n\nThe presence of water in the rock mass and the angle of the mountain slope are among the causes listed.\n\nAn earthquake was ruled out as a possible factor, but the report said the rockfall took place in an area reported to be \"very unstable\" and \"subject to continuous slumping and sliding\".\n\nRocks are typically held in place with friction, the weight supported by the material below it.\n\nBut when this disappears, either because the soil has loosened or due to fractures in the rock underneath, it can give way.\n\nWhat may have started off as zones of weakness in the structure caused by the presence of water, eventually fragmented into large boulders, triggering an avalanche event.\n\n\"They are exceptionally violent events,\" Professor Dave Petley, a landslide expert and vice chancellor at the University of Hull, told the ABC.\n\nThe landslide that struck Enga was one of PNG's deadliest natural disasters.\n\nAnd in its aftermath, authorities have warned of the danger of another one occurring, with large cracks in the adjacent mountainside worsening over the past couple of days.\n\nGiven the risks, the draft report warns that the highland community needs to be urgently cleared of people.\n\nIt goes on to say there is a very high likelihood of further landslides in the immediate future, ruling out the possibility of the area being rehabilitated and resettled.\n\n\"This area has to be declared a no-go-zone,\" it states.\n\nThe PNG Defence Force is already evacuating the area and asking locals to stop using the zone as a thoroughfare.\n\nWhile the country has experienced catastrophic events before, Professor Petley said 2024 has been a \"really exceptional\" year for rockfalls.\n\nSo far, there have been 11 major fatal landslides across the country, a phenomenon which he says is \"really, really unusual\".\n\n\"Since we started [tracking landslides] in 2004, we've not seen a year like this,\" he said.\n\n\"2024 does stand out, even before this event, as a really exceptional year in Papua New Guinea.\"\n\nPNG is home to one of the wettest climates in the world, with its monsoon season starting in December and continuing through to March.\n\nAnnual rainfall in the Yambali area typically exceeds around 2,600 millimetres, but the internal report found the months of January and May this year recorded \"substantial amounts\".\n\nThe highest rainfall figure was recorded 10 days prior to the landslide.\n\n\"It is an El Nino year and Papua New Guinea has been suffering really extreme rainfall for a number of months, which is probably the underlying factor that's triggered this event,\" Professor Petley said.\n\nAs the government grapples with how to provide help to the remote area, nearby communities are coming to terms with the scale of their loss.\n\nEarthquakes, droughts, floods, landslides and even volcanoes have wreaked havoc on PNG communities and shaped how it responds to disasters.\n\nIn 1937, at least 500 people died from an eruption of the volcanoes surrounding Rabaul, while another one in 1994 prompted the entire island to be evacuated.\n\nFour years later, a tsunami triggered by two earthquakes crashed into a 30-kilometre stretch of PNG's coast washing away entire villages.\n\nAuthorities described the event as a \"wake up call\" for its disaster management system, prompting more investment in risk mitigation and preparedness.\n\nBut even now, surviving a natural disaster and recovering from its aftermath depends on where you live.\n\nIn the Highlands, remote communities are cut off from aid by distance and a lack of accessibility.\n\nThe aftermath of a catastrophic event often makes an already difficult journey to these isolated areas almost impossible to complete.\n\nLast week, aid started flowing slowly into the villages hit by the landslide.\n\nMore significant quantities of food, tents and medical kits arrived on Monday in large trucks, which took days to reach the area.\n\nThousands gathered around as bags of rice and boxes of tuna were unloaded and distributed to those worst affected by the landslide.\n\nDoug May, who leads the Australian Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) that was sent in to assist, said between 5,000 to 6,000 people may need to be relocated.\n\n\"Villages below the slide now have contaminated water coming through and a chance of having the slide come all the way down to them because it's still moving,\" he said.\n\nSome locals have started using trees and leaves to construct temporary shelters, but it's not enough to meet demand.\n\nWhile the influx of aid buoyed spirits earlier this week, villagers have questioned why it took so long to get help.\n\nKurang Ambolo, who led a small group of community volunteers which helped recover the deceased and prepare their bodies to be buried, says locals have made do with what they have at hand.\n\n\"The coffin boxes are home-made, they were not given to us,\" he said.\n\n\"We used timber and nails and we built the coffins ourselves.\"\n\nHis team also helped coordinate a survey to determine the people most in need of aid.\n\nIt will be a welcome relief to locals left reeling by the disaster.\n\nThe changing of seasons will offer further consolation, with less rainfall expected in the months ahead, hopefully lowering the risk of landslips.\n\nBut for a community whose lives were shattered in an avalanche of rock and soil, the fear of another deadly disaster will stay with them for some time.", "source":

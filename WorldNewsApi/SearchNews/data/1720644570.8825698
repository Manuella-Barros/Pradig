{"id": 231236462, "title": "Video: Maxx Crosby Says Raiders Once Saw UFO on Flight Back from Game vs. Dolphins", "text": "There's always been an out-of-this-world quality to everything about the Las Vegas Raiders, so it makes sense they might be a team that experienced something not of this earth. Appearing on The Jim Rome Show, Raiders star Maxx Crosby said the team once saw a UFO on a flight to Miami. According to Crosby's recollection of the event, there was \"nothing\" showing up on the plane's radar when they saw something \"like a big shining light going in and out.\" Given what we know about the way some NFL players spend their time thinking about things, it's refreshing to hear one like Crosby who allows himself to experience the great wonders of the universe. In March, the Pentagon released a study examining reported UFO sightings over the last century. The findings, unfortunately, found no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial intelligence. It's unclear if Crosby and the Raiders reported their UFO sighting while the study was going on. Their only trips to Miami to take on the Dolphins since he entered the NFL in were for a preseason game in August 2022 and Week 11 of the 2023 regular season. Crosby didn't specify when the sighting occurred, but since he said everybody on the flight, including the pilots, saw it, there are plenty of people who could be asked to corroborate his story. There will be another opportunity for Crosby and the Raiders to potentially make a connection with UFOs and extraterrestrial beings this season. They have to travel to Miami for another Week 11 matchup (coincidence?) with the Dolphins.", "summary": "There's always been an out-of-this-world quality to everything about the Las Vegas Raiders, so it makes sense they might be a team that experienced something\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124025-video-maxx-crosby-says-raiders-once-saw-ufo-on-flight-back-from-game-vs-dolphins", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_0,y_239,w_1800,h_1196,c_crop/v1717849242/bji6ibzuymztx87kbphq.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:48:46", "author": "Adam Wells", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.176}

AP\n\nNew Barcelona manager Hansi Flick made a triumphant start to his tenure on Tuesday after the Spanish giants beat Manchester City 3-2 after penalties in a pre-season friendly at Orlando. Toni Fernandez, who signed with Barca earlier this month after turning 16, flicked in a left-footed shot past reserve City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give the German manager's side a 4-1 win on penalties after the teams played to a 2-2 draw.\n\nBarcelona kicked off their US tour in the pre-season contest against the four-time reigning Premier League champions, guided by former Barcelona player and coach Pep Guardiola.\n\nA sellout crowd of 63,237 spectators were unhappy early as a storm delayed the start by 80 minutes, but were delighted with a strong early pace, before both teams gave reserve players abundant time on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona jumped ahead 3-0 on penalty kicks thanks to a left-footed shot by Alejandro Balde before Amar Ahmed kept City in it by beating reserve Barca 'keeper Ander Astralaga, setting the stage for the teen newcomer's heroics.\n\nPau Victor had opened the scoring in open play for Barcelona in the 24th minute, taking a quick through ball pass from Marc Casado and firing a right-footed blast from the right side into the goal.\n\nNico O'Riley answered for Manchester City in the 39th minute, firing in a left-footed shot from the left side off a pass from Josko Gvardiol, the Croatian international making his first US tour start.\n\nPablo Torre's goal in the second minute of first-half stoppage time gave Barcelona a 2-1 half-time lead.\n\nThe 21-year-old Spanish midfielder took a centering pass from Gerard Martin at the left wing, nudged the ball to his right, then blasted a right-footed shot past Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson and inside the left post.\n\nJack Grealish equalized for City in the 60th minute off an impressive fast break.\n\nCroatian international Mateo Kovacic, making his first start on City's US tour, gathered a loose ball just beyond the City box, split two defenders and raced upfield with the ball before passing to English left winger Grealish, who outraced a defender and finished with an outstanding left-footed shot from a steep angle high into the goal.\n\nBarcelona will continue their US tour with pre-season matches against Real Madrid and AC Milan.\n\nCity, which lost earlier US matches to Celtic and AC Milan, will close the US tour by facing Chelsea on Saturday at Columbus, Ohio.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

friendly at Orlando finished 2-2 at full-time.\n\nALSO READ: AC Milan edge Man City and Arsenal beat Man United in USA\n\nToni Fernandez, who signed with Barca earlier this month after turning 16, flicked in a left-footed shot past reserve City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give the German manager's side a 4-1 win on penalties.\n\nBarcelona kicked off their US tour in the pre-season contest against the four-time reigning Premier League champions, guided by former Barcelona player and coach Pep Guardiola.\n\nA sellout crowd of 63,237 spectators were unhappy early as a storm delayed the start by 80 minutes, but were delighted with a strong early pace, before both teams gave reserve players abundant time on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona jumped ahead 3-0 on penalty kicks thanks to a left-footed shot by Alejandro Balde before Amar Ahmed kept City in it by beating reserve Barca goalkeeper Ander Astralaga, setting the stage for the teen newcomer's heroics.\n\nPau Victor had opened the scoring in open play for Barcelona in the 24th minute, taking a quick through ball pass from Marc Casado and firing a right-footed blast from the right side into the goal.\n\nNico O'Riley answered for Manchester City in the 39th minute, firing in a left-footed shot from the left side off a pass from Josko Gvardiol, the Croatian international making his first US tour start.\n\nPablo Torre's goal in the second minute of first-half stoppage time gave Barcelona a 2-1 half-time lead.\n\nThe 21-year-old Spanish midfielder took a centering pass from Gerard Martin at the left wing, nudged the ball to his right, then blasted a right-footed shot past Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson and inside the left post.\n\nJack Grealish equalized for City in the 60th minute off an impressive fast break.\n\nCroatian international Mateo Kovacic, making his first start on City's US tour, gathered a loose ball just beyond the City box, split two defenders and raced upfield with the ball before passing to English left winger Grealish, who outraced a defender and finished with an outstanding left-footed shot from a steep angle high into the goal.\n\nBarcelona will continue their US tour with pre-season matches against Real Madrid and AC Milan.\n\nCity, who lost earlier US matches to Celtic and AC Milan, will close the US tour by facing Chelsea on Saturday at Columbus, Ohio.", "source":

City have lost their opening two pre-season fixtures to Celtic and AC Milan. Hansi Flick's Barcelona side set for first game in the states this summer.\n\nAs all of the European giants are beginning their pre-season friendlies ahead of the 2024/25 campaign, two heavyweight clubs will meet in the United States, with four-time consecutive Premier League champions Manchester City taking on La Liga runners-up Barcelona. The Cityzens will be searching for a more defensively secure performance following back-to-back high-scoring defeats at the hands of Scottish Premiership champions, Celtic, and Italian outfit AC Milan in their opening friendly match, while Barca will look to start their pre-season off with a victory, having only played behind doors against fourth division Spanish outfit, UE Olot, winning 1-0.\n\nDue to both sides having ambitions of winning the titles in their respective leagues, it will be important that all of their players get in rhythm during the pre-season. Despite this being a friendly, there will be an aspect of professional pride and competitiveness that will kick in, specifically for Barcelona under their new manager Hansi Flick, as players will be competing for places in the starting eleven ahead of the new season.\n\nManchester City vs. Barcelona: Match Information\n\nWhen\n\n31/07/24\n\nWhere\n\nCamping World Stadium\n\nTime\n\n00:00 GMT\n\nLocation\n\nOrlando, Florida, United States\n\nTV\n\nPremier Sports 1/Premier Sports Player\n\nRelated Ranking Pep Guardiola's 10 Best Signings at Manchester City\n\nPep Guardiola has assembled one of the greatest sides in football history.\n\nManchester City vs. Barcelona - Form Guide Guardiola to take on his boyhood club\n\nAs it's pre-season, and only Manchester City have officially played, competing in two friendly matches against Celtic and AC Milan heading into this clash, with Barcelona starting their friendly campaign against Pep Guardiola's side so producing a comprehensive breakdown of both teams' form is difficult.\n\nNevertheless, City have not been at their best so far, losing both of their games in pre-season and conceding seven goals in those two games, and if they continue to defend lackadaisically, they will once again be punished by the sheer quality that Barcelona possess in attacking areas. For the Spaniards, the new boss will look to impose his philosophy and style of play on the team, which is a high-pressing brand of football.\n\nRelated Who is Barcelona and Spain Wonderkid Lamine Yamal\n\nLamine Yamal broke another record after scoring a stunning strike in Spain's Euro 2024 semi-final clash against France.\n\nManchester City vs. Barcelona Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis\n\nAccording to PaddyPower, Manchester City are the favourites to win this fixture at 4/5, while Barcelona are the slight underdogs in this matchup with a 27/10 chance of winning, the possibility of a draw sits at 16/5.\n\nThe double chance odds have City and a draw at 2/7, Barcelona or a draw at 10/11, and the betting odds for either side to win are 2/9. The cutoff point that has been set by PaddyPower for goals over and under is 2.5 goals. The odds for over 2.5 goals is 3/10, while the under is 12/5. The odds for both teams to score is 1/3 for 'yes' and 9/4 for 'no'.\n\nRelated Manchester City's 10 Most Expensive Strikers Pre-Haaland Ranked\n\nIt's hard to imagine life up front at Man City without Erling Haaland but the most expensive strikers before his arrival have been ranked.\n\nPrediction Goals in Orlando\n\nAgainst Celtic and AC Milan, Pep Guardiola's starting eleven consisted of a lot of young players, specifically in the backline, with some of the experienced first-team members also featuring. Though due to 'the Citizens' having the highest number of players at Euro 2024 for a club, the vast majority of the squad have not joined up yet as they are still on their summer vacations after competing in their respective international tournaments.\n\nSimilarly, Flick's opted to select a predominantly youthful eleven against UE Olot, but beginning their pre-season tour, it is likely that the German will pick from some of his more experienced men on Wednesday. If Guardiola again elects a back four of youngsters, it could once again become a case of a high-scoring match, but with Barcelona's lack of options due to the Olympic Games and injuries sustained, GMS believe this match will end 3-1 by way of Manchester City.\n\nTeam News Plenty of rotation expected\n\nIn their opening two games of pre-season, Manchester City have lined up with a considerably weakened backline containing youth products and a heavier front three consisting of Erling Haaland, Jack Grealish, and Oscar Bobb, explaining why they have scored and conceded a lot of goals in both fixtures. Facing off against Barcelona, they are expected to adopt a similar approach once again, as most of their first team defenders are currently not with the squad due to competing at Euro 2024. Ederson Moraes, Stefan Ortega, Rico Lewis, and Kalvin Phillips are the only other first-team members currently on the United States tour.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona will come into this fixture relatively light as well, with big hitters Ansu Fati, Frenkie de Jong, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, and Pedri all being sidelined with injuries. Eric Garcia, Fermin Lopez, and Pau Cubarsi will also miss out on this match, as they are currently on international duty at the Olympic Games representing Spain. However, despite these players missing, the Blaugranes will have plenty of first-team members available to them here, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Alejandro Balde, Inigo Martinez, Andreas Christensen, Jules Kounde, Ilkay Gundogan, Robert Lewandowski, and Raphinha all options for Hansi Flick.\n\nRelated Ranking the 8 Greatest El Clasico Matches of the 21st Century\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid have played out some incredible games over the years, boasting stars like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nHead-to-head History and Results Barca dominant in previous matches\n\nHaving only faced each other six times in competitive history by way of the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona and Manchester City matched up on all six occasions inside a two-year period, from 2014 to 2016. Five victories from six matches means that the Catalonian outfit is clearly the A-side. However, a lot has changed in eight years, with City coming on leaps and bounds since the last time they faced.\n\nManchester City wins: 1\n\nBarcelona wins: 5\n\nDraws: 0\n\nRelated The 22 best players you forgot played for Manchester City (Ranked)\n\nThe 22 best players that fans might have forgotten once played for Manchester City have been listed and ranked\n\nManchester City's Pre-season Schedule Champions to go head-to-head with Manchester rivals August 3rd: Manchester City v Chelsea, Ohio Stadium, Columbus (22:30) August 10th: Manchester City v Manchester United, Community Shield, Wembley (15:00) Barcelona's Pre-season Schedule August: 4th Barcelona v Real Madrid, MetLife Stadium, New Jersey (00:00) August 7th: Barcelona v AC Milan, M&T Bank Stadium, Maryland (15:00) August 12th: Barcelona v AS Monaco, Joan Gamper Trophy, Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium (19:00)\n\nStatistics from Transfermarkt.

The match marked a successful start for new Barcelona manager, Hansi Flick, with the Spanish club winning 4-1 on penalties.\n\nThe game, attended by 63,237 spectators, was delayed by 80 minutes due to a storm. Pau Victor opened the scoring for Barcelona in the 24th minute, followed by an equaliser from Nico O'Riley for City in the 39th minute. Pablo Torre put Barcelona ahead again just before halftime, but Jack Grealish levelled the score in the 60th minute.\n\nThe penalty shootout saw Barcelona take a 3-0 lead before City's Amar Ahmed scored. Toni Fernandez, a recent 16-year-old signing for Barcelona, sealed the victory with a left-footed shot past City's reserve goalkeeper Stefan Ortega.\n\nBoth teams used the match to give playing time to reserve players. Notable performances included Croatian international Josko Gvardiol making his first US tour start for City, and Mateo Kovacic impressing in midfield as usual.\n\nBarcelona will continue their US tour with matches against Real Madrid and AC Milan.

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nBarcelona are just getting started in the USA. They will face a Manchester City side that has already played twice in the country, losing both.\n\nAs well as being the first match of the pre-season for the Catalans, it will also be the first time the team will be led by new head coach Hansi Flick.\n\nFlick was appointed as the new Barcelona boss at the end of May in bizarre circumstances. Previous head coach Xavi announced in January that he intended to step down at the end of the season. The club then persuaded the former player to stay on in April, before changing their mind and sacking him just over a month later.\n\nBarcelona are taking a 31-man squad to tour the USA. But there are some notable absentees with Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres both rested after their Euro 2024 exploits. Also missing is Fermin Lopez, Eric Garcia and Pau Cubarsi. The trio are currently representing Spain at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAs for Manchester City, they have already been beaten twice on their tour of the USA.\n\nA somewhat makeshift side started the tour off with a 4-3 defeat to Celtic last Wednesday, and a similar looking team went down 3-2 to AC Milan on Saturday night in New York.\n\nGuardiola has also been outspoken in recent days, bemoaning the fixture schedule.\n\nHis squad in the USA is without Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Rodri, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku. All have been given an extended break after the recents Euros. Guardiola has indicated they will all be looked after with a long and gruelling season ahead.\n\nHowever, linking up with the squad in America are Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic. The Croatian duo will join the likes of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish and should be available for the Barca clash.\n\nThere is no Barcelona form to go on, and Manchester City don't look to be having a great time in the USA. City has been busy at both ends of the pitch, scoring and conceding plenty, and we can only see that continuing against Barcelona in Florida.\n\nErling Haaland has two goals in two matches on Manchester City's American tour. The back-to-back Premier League Golden Boot winner is one of the big names on the trip given Norway's failure to make it to the Euros in Germany.\n\nHaaland's fellow City striker Julian Alvarez is currently away on international duty with Argentina. So with Alvarez trying to add an Olympic gold to his impressive medal collection, the big Norwegian looks set to lead the City line again against Barcelona.\n\nIn a match likely to see plenty of attacking football, don't be surprised to see Haaland on the scoresheet again.\n\n\u26bd Bet on Erling Haaland to score any time at 6/5 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nDespite this being Barca's opening fixture of the summer, we can still see them playing an expansive game as they look to put on a show for their American audience.\n\nThe Catalans may be without a whole host of attacking talent. But they still have plenty to offer up front with Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Toni Fernandez and Pau Victor all in the squad.\n\nBoth of Manchester City's matches on their tour of the USA have seen plenty of goals. City will want to play to their strengths. And with nearly all of their regular defence missing, Pep Guardiola will know that attack is the best form of defence against his former team.\n\nAttacks are likely to be on top in this match, meaning there should be plenty of goals.\n\n\u26bd Back over 4.5 goals at 11/5 with BetMGM \u26bd\n\nIn their 4-3 defeat to Celtic, City had to fight back from 1-0 down and 3-1 down. When Pep's team got the match back to 3-3, they looked set to win. Instead they went down to a 4-3 defeat.\n\nA similar theme followed in City's 3-2 defeat against AC Milan. On this occasion, City went 1-0 up thanks to an opening goal by Erling Haaland after 19 minutes. City then found themselves 2-1 down after a brace from Lorenzo Colombo. James McAtee levelled the match for the Light Blues after 55 minutes, and then Marco Nasti won the match for the Italians with a goal on 78 minutes.\n\nIn both matches City has been level going into the last 30 minutes, and they have lost them both.\n\nIf City go into the lead, there is a good chance they won't hold onto it. The Light Blues have an inexperienced defence on this tour, and there's a good chance they won't be able to keep a Barcelona side featuring guys like Robert Lewandowski quiet.\n\n\u26bd Back Barcelona to come from behind and beat Man City at 7/1 with bet365\u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

However, they bounced back on each occasion with Nico O'Reilly and Jack Grealish scoring the goals to avoid a third successive defeat in the United States.\n\nPlenty of fringe players were given minutes, with Kalvin Phillips employed at centre-back in the game - a role he has rarely played at the Etihad. Here are some of the things you might have missed from the Camping World Stadium.\n\nREAD MORE: What Grealish did after Man City goal vs Barcelona shows his true colours\n\nREAD MORE: Man City player ratings vs Barcelona as Grealish and Phillips good\n\nLewis out on his own\n\nRico Lewis is the only player to have played every minute of City's three friendly games. None of those minutes have come in the advanced midfield position that he craves the most but it has to go in his favour that he's had such a quick start and is in control physically at such an early stage of the campaign. The England Under-21 international wants to kick on this season and if he can show himself to be reliable those opportunities will come.\n\nGuardiola doesn't hide his emotions\n\nFans sheltered from the lightning before the game and the perspex dugout hosting the City manager once play got under way would have hidden away if it could have done. Instead, it got multiple wallopings inside a minute from Guardiola as he took exception at the way his side were playing towards the end of the first half. Guardiola has spoken before about the importance of taking friendlies seriously and he did not go easy on his players just because the game wasn't a competitive fixture.\n\nHaaland withdrawn\n\nErling Haaland has had a full summer of rest and has been speaking about how refreshed he is after more time off than he would normally have. However, he still only played 45 minutes before being taken off at the break as City continue to look after their No.9 to avoid pushing him too hard too early.\n\nIt's a reminder of the battle they face to keep him fit for every game - he doesn't tend to get many rests in the season when he is fit but missed more than two months last season through to injury.\n\nFriendlier reunions\n\nYou could have cut the ice at Yankee Stadium as Guardiola strolled across to say hello to his former player Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swedish striker has had many unflattering things to say about Guardiola since he was demoted below Lionel Messi in the Barcelona hierarchy, and struggled to make eye contact with the City boss in an awkward encounter before the AC Milan friendly.\n\nThings were much friendlier in Orlando.

It was a lovely team goal, set-up by Marc Casado.\n\nThe Sky Blues were able to level it in the 39th minute when Nico O'Reilly got in behind the Barcelona defence and beat I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a with a far post finish. Josko Gvardiol played a wonderful through ball behind the Barcelona back-line to put O'Reilly through on goal.\n\nHowever, Barcelona retook the lead with the last kick of the half when Pablo Torre beat Ederson from the edge of the box. Torre's shot dipped just before getting to Ederson and the Brazilian keeper got a hand too it but wasn't able to push the shot wide.\n\nWhile strong second-half responses have been a bit of trend for Manchester City during their summer pre-season tour of the US, the response in Orlando was slightly muted.\n\nAn equaliser did come in the 60th minute when Jack Grealish rifled in a shot to the far post. The goal was set-up by Mateo Kovacic, who calmly dribbled past three players deep in Manchester City's own half, before carrying the ball nearly the full length of the pitch and finding Grealish.\n\nIt was one of the few exciting moments of the second-half, that was marred with fouls and constant substitutions in the oppressive Florida heat and humidity.\n\nAfter finishing 2-2 at full time, the victor would be determined by penalties: Kalvin Phillips and Jacob Wright had both of their penalty attempts saved, putting Manchester City in an early hole. Barcelona converted their first four attempts to seal the victory for the Spanish side.\n\nHere are the five things learned from Manchester City's pre-season match against Barcelona!\n\nThere's not a lot of positives to be said about Kalvin Phillips' Manchester City tenure. It seems as though anything that can go wrong has gone wrong for the former Leeds midfielder. Yet, a centre-back selection gave us a glimpse into a possible new use for a player who is on the verge of being forced of the club.\n\nWhile little should be taken seriously from only a single pre-season match, moments like this can unlock a players future. Normally that is only seen in youth players, but it was reassuring to see that Phillips was able to hold his own when playing out of position.\n\nThe poor penalty attempt put a damper on the overall performance, but for 90 minutes Phillips at least looked serviceable, and that was new.\n\nSpeaking of youth players and moments during the preseason... Nico O'Reilly might have just found himself a spot on Manchester City's first-team, at least according to Pep Guardiola. The Catalonian praised the 19-year-old midfielder after the match with a simple: \"He can play with us.\"\n\nO'Reilly led the stats in ground duels won and dribbles completed, and scored an excellent goal with a well-timed run into the box. Like Phil Foden and Rico Lewis before him, sometimes a few bright moments in a pre-season match is all that it takes to break into the first-team.\n\nIt hasn't been a fun 2024 for Jack Grealish. His club season was marred by fitness issues and rumors of a dip in intensity, and it reached a boiling point when we was left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the European Championships.\n\nHowever, the 28-year-old has respond well to the adversity. Grealish has shown up to pre-season in excellent shape and has shown flashes of brilliance during the US tour.\n\nNone have been brighter than the goal he scored in the second-half to equalise on Tuesday. It's a small confidence boost that Grealish might beed before heading into a vital season that will likely decide his Manchester City future.\n\nFrom transfer rumors, to disputes with journalists, and now sloppy goalkeeping, it hasn't been a great week for Ederson. The Brazilian has been left out to dry on several occasions due to a random assortment of centre-back pairings, but that doesn't fully exonerate him.\n\nEderson now has five goals conceded in two matches, and on four occasions he got a (weak) hand to them and couldn't pull off a save. Yes, it's only pre-season. However, it's a worrying start after a controversy-laden summer.\n\nThere is still time until the start of the season and he'll have a few more opportunities for a confidence boost, but it's certainty something to make a note of.\n\nSomethings never change, and Manchester City's struggles with penalties are one of them. Doesn't matter the competition or opposition, if Erling Haaland isn't on the pitch then Manchester City are in trouble.

Results matter very little, however, and the Spaniard has taken plenty of positives from City's first 180 minutes of action out in the States.\n\nGuardiola is now preparing to face his former club in Orlando, with Barca only recently arriving in the country. Their duel with the perennial Premier League champions is the first of Barca's tour, and Hansi Flick hasn't been able to call upon an array of crucial cogs for their summer venture.\n\nEderson played the vast majority of City's most recent friendly against Milan, struggling in the 3-2 defeat. He was replaced by Scott Carson late on in New York, and Stefan Ortega could return to the starting XI on Tuesday night.\n\nGuardiola is still without a long list of senior players in the States, but Croatians Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic could make their first starts of the tour in Orlando.\n\nThere's talk of Kalvin Phillips potentially being used at centre-back in this one, with Rico Lewis, Oscar Bobb and Erling Haaland also set to continue in the XI.\n\nMan City predicted lineup vs Barcelona (4-3-3): Ortega; Lewis, Phillips, Gvardiol, Wilson-Esbrand; O'Reilly, Kovacic, Perrone; Bobb, Haaland, Grealish.\n\nFlick has named a 31-man squad for Barca's US tour, but the new manager is without ten senior stars.\n\nFrenkie de Jong, Ronald Araujo, Gavi and Pedri are among the players to miss out through injury. Alejandro Balde has finally recovered from his long-term setback and will take to the field in the States.\n\nIlkay Gundogan and Raphinha will join the squad ahead of Tuesday night's game, but neither player should be expected to start against City. Lamine Yamal has been handed extra time to recover from his Euro 2024 exploits.\n\nBarcelona predicted lineup vs Man City (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; J. Araujo, Christensen, Martinez, Fort; Romeu, Casado, Pablo Torre; Victor, Lewandowski, Roque.\n\nWe should get to enjoy more of La Masia this summer given the long list of senior absences from Flick's pre-season squad. Marc Casado, Pablo Torre and Mika Faye are among the unfamiliar Barca youngsters to keep an eye on.\n\nCity are similarly youthful out in the States, but they're further along in their pre-season preparations than their upcoming opponents and that counts for plenty when predicting the winner of such bouts.\n\nCity's academy stars have been competitive in their first two games of the tour, and the additions of a couple more senior standouts should tip Tuesday night's clash in their favour. We shouldn't be expecting too much from Barca in Orlando.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It even drew applause from Erling Haaland so can't have been bad.\n\nAnd his overall performance, playing a little deeper than usual, was full of strong moments in the tackle and a good range of passing. The odd little mistake here and there but to be expected.\n\nO'Reilly - represented by the same agency as Guardiola - will hope he is given some cup games this season to show more in competitive fixtures.\n\nNico O'Reilly showcased his finishing ability by netting City's first goal in the first half\n\nMixed evening's for the Croatian duo\n\nThe two Croatians, Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic, are playing a bit of catch up after arriving in New York and feeling their way into pre-season.\n\nBoth had their moments in Orlando. Kovacic in particular sems like he's never been away, gliding through midfield on his first 65-minute appearance back.\n\nAnd the way he took six Barca players out of the game during a powerful 70-yard run for Jack Grealish's goal show that he is more than just a credible rotational option to Rodri.\n\nThat central midfield area will be crowded given Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva but Kovacic's performances towards the end of last season make him difficult to dislodge.\n\nGvardiol had more of a mixed evening. There were lapses in concentration at centre half - his natural position but one he barely operates in anymore - and his impatient press led to Barca's opener. But then the pass for O'Reilly's strike served as a reminder of his quality in possession.\n\nMateo Kovacic returned with a brilliant assist on the counter attack for Jack Grealish's strike\n\nGrealish shows his goalscoring threat\n\nEven before his goal, Grealish was acting with a bit more of an edge in this friendly. More willing to run at his man and seemingly more in tune with those around him.\n\nThe finish will have done him good, owing much to the aforementioned Kovacic burst. A confident finish across the goalkeeper on his left foot after settling himself.\n\nHe admitted to us earlier in the week that the England snub was the hardest moment of his career and has something to prove 'to some people'. Gareth Southgate being one of them, you presume.\n\nGrealish has been criticised for a lack of goals and assists since joining City for \u00a3100million yet does also know his value within Guardiola's team.\n\n'I want to score, because in football there is no better feeling than scoring goals, but it is a team game,' he said a few months back after an encouraging display at Crystal Palace.\n\n'I feel I bring so much more to the team than just goals and assists. If you watch the Palace game back you'll see I played well. It's just a shame that everyone in the world now just loves stats.'\n\nHe's not wrong but a few more goals like this wouldn't hurt.\n\nGrealish has previously been criticised for not providing more goals and assists in the team\n\nA new position for Phillips?\n\nBarcelona, a sell-out 63,237 crowd, did Guardiola overthink the occasion? Don't write in. It's a joke.\n\nAn inventive call at the back though, which became clear when Kalvin Phillips was doing drills as a centre back in training 24 hours beforehand.\n\nAnd Phillips did well there, next to Gvardiol. More time on the ball, that extra second to pick his pass, and he seemed far more comfortable. Defensively solid too. Perhaps some food for thought for the England international.\n\nElsewhere, Maximo Perrone was a false nine for a spell and Jaden Heskey - son of Emile - showed glimpses of real potential during a short cameo.\n\nKalvin Phillips put in a solid display at the heart of defence, an unfamiliar position for him\n\nA reminder that technology is needed\n\nThere is often that phenomenon of players becoming better for not actually featuring and that was definitely true of technology during this.\n\nHaaland looked certain to have given City an 11th-minute lead when the Norwegian stretched a limb to divert Oscar Bobb's cross home.\n\nBarcelona goalkeeper Pena did well in scrambling to get something behind the effort but didn't seem to prevent it going behind the line.\n\nReplays showed that it appeared to have crept across but the linesman, who was stood behind the goalkeeper's body, didn't see it.\n\nErling Haaland's first half volley had seemingly crossed the line but a goal was not given\n\nWith no goal line technology, we played on and Barca took the lead 13 minutes later. Although none of that mattered on the night, a reminder that some technology does enhance proceedings.\n\nOn Haaland, it's interesting that Guardiola has opted to substitute the striker at half time of the last two friendlies while others stay on midway into the second half. 'Erling has already rested,' Guardiola said last week. '(If) he's tired, go to bed early. Focus 24 hours and you will be ready. Tiredness is not an excuse. I push him to be more focused.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He accepts it's up to him to turn things around, but he's also ready to prove people wrong.\n\nFrom the first whistle in Orlando, Grealish sent Barcelona a couple of warnings - two efforts flashing wide of the near post after cutting inside. He wore the captain's armband in the second half and had earlier reacted angrily to a needlessly late challenge after the ball went out.\n\nWhen Mateo Kovacic turned and darted past five players in two touches, Grealish set off, holding his position and finishing powerfully across goal and into the top corner. He could have run off celebrating madly, or back to the centre circle. Instead, he threw a fist as if to say 'about time.'\n\nREAD MORE: Barcelona vs Man City highlights and reaction from Orlando\n\nREAD MORE: Man City player ratings vs Barcelona as Grealish and Phillips good\n\nIt was a reaction that released five weeks of frustration, hurt and an inability to tell his own side of the story. In two days, he's said his piece and got back on the scoresheet. This was his best performance of the summer to date.\n\nAppropriately for the Camping World Stadium, City pitched up in Orlando and the heavens opened - and didn't close until the Blues departed. It had been glorious sunshine for the three days City had been in Florida, but an electrical storm an hour before kick-off delayed the game by 80 minutes.\n\nWith 30 minutes without lightning needed to end the delay, fans sheltered in the concourses and City stayed in the dressing room. Ilkay Gundogan - not in the Barcelona team but with the squad - caught up with Pep Guardiola and presumably a couple of his former teammates. Erling Haaland was booed onto the pitch when City finally emerged for warm-ups with the tunnel in the middle of thousands of Barcelona fans.\n\nHaaland had a summer off and two goals in two going into this fixture, delivering for City on the pitch with the ball and off it commercially. His relationship with Oscar Bobb is flourishing, and he almost had three in three when Bobb's back-post cross was met by his compatriot's outstretched leg.\n\nYou've seen the goal before, and fans in Orlando technically saw it again. But Inaki Pena managed to claw it away, convincing the officials the ball didn't cross the line. Replays showed it had, yet the lack of goal-line technology meant there was no review.\n\nHaaland was celebrating 20 minutes later, however, when he was first on the spot to congratulate Nico O'Reilly on a first senior goal. The midfielder's smart run, turn and finish from Josko Gvardiol's excellent pass, belied his years. But this is a player who has scored last minute scorpion kicks to win games for the academy, and 40-yard lobs in the Manchester derby. He isn't short of confidence.\n\nHaaland had made the run next to O'Reilly in front of goal, waiting for the cross to tap into an open net. This time he didn't get it, and in the past he's fumed at teammates who don't lay it on a plate. Here, his first reaction was to applaud O'Reilly.\n\nThe striker told reporters last week he is 'rested and ready to go' this season, and that he feels amazing after a summer off. He noted that he was not at his optimal best after a mid-season injury, and that impacted his performances and sharpness.\n\nThe attack is looking fluid too. As well as O'Reilly's run into the box, Oscar Bobb looked impressive again, interchanging with James McAtee, who was also linking well with left-winger Jack Grealish and right-back Rico Lewis. This was City's best attacking performance of the tour - even though they had scored three and two in their opening encounters.\n\nThey're leaking goals however. Four in the first friendly, three in the second, and two by half-time in Orlando.

The latter acrobatically prodded the former's delivery towards goal, only for the referee to signal play on, despite the ball seemingly crossing the line.\n\nBarcelona began to impose themselves on the game thereafter and opened the scoring after a neat move, Marc Casado's tidy flick bypassing the onrushing Josko Gvardiol and putting Victor clean through to slide his finish underneath Ederson.\n\nCity were soon back in their stride though, forcing Inaki Pena into a reaction stop when Bobb's free-kick went all the way through a crowd, creating a pinball in the box which eventually saw O'Reilly having a second blocked effort of the half, and drawing another sprawling save from Kalvin Phillips' well-struck dead ball.\n\nThe writing was on the wall that City were only a matter of time away from equalising, and just over five minutes from half-time, they did. Jack Grealish was involved again, inviting Josko Gvardiol to come forward and pick out a delightful through-ball to Nico O'Reilly, who wasn't to be denied a third time, expertly finishing into the bottom corner.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of the second half followed a similar pattern to much of the first, with City playing sharp possession football but coming undone with Barcelona's directness, as second-half goalkeeper Stefan Ortega recovered to deny Pau Victor his second goal after the Spaniard had attempted to round him.\n\nThen it was City's turn for directness, and the results were astounding. A quite amazing passage of play from Mateo Kovacic saw the Croatian carry the ball from the edge of his own box deep into Barcelona territory, taking most of Catalan team out of the game in the process with breathtaking skill, before playing Grealish in to lash emphatically into the roof of the net.\n\nThe usual host of second-half substitutions from both sides did hinder the game's fluidity, with clear-cut openings much harder to come by after that moment of magic from the Blues, meaning the teams laboured into a shootout where Kalvin Phillips and Jacob Wright had their kicks saved for Manchester City, and Amar Fatah's goal couldn't stop the Barcelona victory.\n\nNext up for Manchester City: Chelsea in the final game of the US tour. Here is how we rated the individual performances of all of Pep Guardiola's players at the Camping World Stadium!\n\nDid well to come and claim a few dangerous balls into the box, but not for the first time this tour, didn't cover himself in glory with his shot stopping.\n\nRico Lewis - 7.5\n\nAs always, ridiculously unflappable in possession. Could have looked a little more forward but still very impressive.\n\nKalvin Phillips - 7.5\n\nSome encouragement for City's beleaguered man, in the 90 minutes at least. Passed and defended with equal assuredness, before seeing his penalty saved.\n\nJosko Gvardiol - 6.5\n\nStraight back into his stride on the ball, picking out a lovely assist for O'Reilly's goal. His defensive awareness did still seem a little rusty though, particularly in leaving a gap which was exploited on Barcelona's opener.\n\nJosh Wilson-Esbrand - 7.5\n\nFar more assured in his defensive actions than his previous start against Celtic, adding to it with some positive play in the Barcelona half.\n\nMateo Kovacic - 8\n\nNever missed a step. So comfortable in congested zones, and his assist for Grealish's goal can only really be described as genius.\n\nNico O'Reilly - 7\n\nStill learning his way with when to try and beat the pressure on him and when to just keep it safe, resulting in some dicey moments. Clearly an extremely talented player though, showcased with great positioning and finishing to equalise.\n\nOscar Bobb - 7\n\nNot quite as productive as his previous two friendlies, and couldn't quite make the right decision in some dangerous moments, but looked very bright again with his running at players.\n\nJames McAtee - 6\n\nOccasionally found space in the pockets but was too easily kept out of the game. Not his best outing of the tour.\n\nJack Grealish - 8 (MOTM)\n\nAnother strong showing from a forward who is certainly hungry to prove his worth this season. A goal for his efforts, and the captain's armband for most of the second-half.\n\nErling Haaland - 6.5\n\nPerhaps incorrectly denied a goal when the ball had appeared to cross the line. Didn't have much involvement otherwise, but got into good areas.\n\nOne moment of sharp sweeping was all he was really required to do.\n\nMaximo Perrone - 6.5\n\nDrifted around the frontline and picked up some interesting zones, without ever influencing the game to a huge degree.\n\nCallum Doyle - 7\n\nCalled into action with a number of big blocks, most notably to track back and shut down Robert Lewandowski when the Pole was running clear in added time.\n\nOne or two neat turns to alleviate pressure in the defensive third. Didn't catch his penalty well.\n\nAmar Fatah - 6.5\n\nWent on a few good drives with the ball. Composed penalty.\n\nLuke Mbete - 6.5\n\nMade an effort to overlap and offer width in an unnatural left-back role.\n\nMicah Hamilton - 6\n\nPopped up in and around the Barcelona box but couldn't create anything.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish",

He will get to his best.\"\n\nThere was another step or two in that direction in Orlando on Tuesday. The 28-year-old had a couple of dribbles that led to shots (of varying quality) but he did grab an emphatic goal for City, slamming the ball into the top corner.\n\nAnd unlike Erling Haaland, who played 45 minutes in each of the past two matches as per a pre-determined plan, Grealish stayed on for 84 minutes, even as City made a string of substitutions earlier in the second half. He said he has got a headstart on his team-mates, fitness-wise, so he will be one to watch going into the new season.\n\nSam Lee\n\nBarca's first friendly was also new head coach Hansi Flick's first test.\n\nThe German was appointed at the end of May and has had to wait two months to take charge of a match for the first time. That period has been filled with doubts about how his team would play, but this first outing helped to ease some of those concerns.\n\nThe first related to his commitment to young players and it is clear that is firm. Despite coming up against a team of the stature of Manchester City, he opted for youth over more established players like Inigo Mart\u00ednez and Oriol Romeu, who have trained with him from day one.\n\nSecondly, it was clear the high pressure the team lacked last season is one of the focal points of his training sessions this season. The players were very focused on winning the ball back as quickly as possible after losing it.\n\nIt was interesting that Vitor Roque was given game time despite not yet having an allocated squad number and his future remaining uncertain, but despite being the only 'star' in the starting team he did not shine in any part of the game.\n\nLastly, it will have been pleasing for Barca's hierarchy to see that the many young players who featured in this game did not look out of place. Perhaps this was evidence that youth can be a club's greatest salvation when financial times are hard and it might not be necessary to spend tens of millions to have a team that can compete with the likes of Manchester City.\n\nLaia Cervello Herrero\n\nNo. City fans might not welcome this specific example, but may at least find it amusing. In 2014, Louis van Gaal oversaw a sparkling pre-season as Manchester United manager, winning all six of their matches, including against Real Madrid and Liverpool, and they swept into the post-David Moyes era in style. Then they lost 2-1 to Swansea City at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.\n\nThe moral of the story is that pre-season matches mean almost nothing, and especially so when you have, at most, five of the players who have made big contributions to their trophies in recent years.\n\nFor that reason, little should be read into the 4-3 defeat by Celtic or the 3-2 loss to AC Milan that preceded this game.\n\nThey might have expected to beat Barcelona, granted, because they are without basically all of their stars, and they have started pre-season later than City, but these games are for fitness and the local fans' enjoyment.\n\nCity did welcome Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic to their tour over the past few days, the only of City's summer internationals to join the tour late, and both started here.\n\nGvardiol played in unfamiliar territory -- in a City shirt anyway -- at centre-back and was caught out for Barca's first goal, but did brilliantly to set up the first equaliser.\n\nKovacic was much more consistent, looking a cut above in midfield and producing the move of the match, turning in midfield and driving up the pitch, taking out five or six players to set up Grealish to make it 2-2. It is easier to focus on the positives at this time of year given the negatives do not really matter.\n\nSam Lee\n\nThere were several. Firstly, the defensive pivot duo of Marc Casado and Marc Bernal. They gave balance between defence and attack and when they played together, while one stayed back, the other could go further forward in attack.\n\nVictor played as a centre-forward and that meant Roque moved to the wing. Victor had several chances and was involved in both goals.\n\nFor the first, he took advantage of great play by Casado to put Barca in front. For the second goal, he cleverly left Gerard Mart\u00edn's pass to enable Torre to score.\n\nEarlier in the game there was a moment where he lost the ball but reacted very quickly to recover, passing it with his heel to Casado, who shot without luck.\n\nAlthough Victor normally plays as a false 9, he was used further forward in a way that suggests he could be an alternative to Robert Lewandowski when the Pole needs a rest. Lewandowski was acclaimed by the fans when he stepped on the pitch.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_lee@nytimes.com", "name": "Sam Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "laia_cervello_herrero@nytimes.com", "name": "Laia Cervell\u00f3 Herrero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lee_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Lee (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Chelsea are another side looking for their first win of the US tour, after drawing with Wrexham and losing 4-1 at the hands of Celtic.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game head coach Enzo Maresca said: \"Club America are a team who are already competing in their competition so for sure they would want to be ahead of us in that kind of thing but we have to follow our way, follow our process on the ball and off the ball in the way we want to be once the season starts.\"\n\nLiverpool and Arsenal are also in action tonight when they meet at the home of the Philadephia Eagles.\n\nThere will be no new faces for Liverpool, but they are still without several first-team players, who are yet to report back for preseason.\n\nFor Arsenal, manager Mikel Arteta has hinted that new signing Riccardo Calafiori could make his debut just days after signing from Serie A side Bologna.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Results matter very little, however, and the Spaniard has taken plenty of positives from City's first 180 minutes of action out in the States.\n\nGuardiola is now preparing to face his former club in Orlando, with Barca only recently arriving in the country. Their duel with the perennial Premier League champions is the first of Barca's tour, and Hansi Flick hasn't been able to call upon an array of crucial cogs for their summer venture.\n\nEderson played the vast majority of City's most recent friendly against Milan, struggling in the 3-2 defeat. He was replaced by Scott Carson late on in New York, and Stefan Ortega could return to the starting XI on Tuesday night.\n\nGuardiola is still without a long list of senior players in the States, but Croatians Josko Gvardiol and Mateo Kovacic could make their first starts of the tour in Orlando.\n\nFlick has named a 31-man squad for Barca's US tour, but the new manager is without ten senior stars.\n\nFrenkie de Jong, Ronald Araujo, Gavi and Pedri are among the players to miss out through injury. Alejandro Balde has finally recovered from his long-term setback and will take to the field in the States.\n\nIlkay Gundogan and Raphinha will join the squad ahead of Tuesday night's game, but neither player should be expected to start against City. Lamine Yamal has been handed extra time to recover from his Euro 2024 exploits.\n\nBarcelona predicted lineup vs Man City (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; J. Araujo, Christensen, Martinez, Fort; Romeu, Casado, Pablo Torre; Victor, Lewandowski, Roque.\n\nWe should get to enjoy more of La Masia this summer given the long list of senior absences from Flick's pre-season squad. Marc Casado, Pablo Torre and Mika Faye are among the unfamiliar Barca youngsters to keep an eye on.\n\nCity are similarly youthful out in the States, but they're further along in their pre-season preparations than their upcoming opponents and that counts for plenty when predicting the winner of such bouts.\n\nCity's academy stars have been competitive in their first two games of the tour, and the additions of a couple more senior standouts should tip Tuesday night's clash in their favour.

Pau Victor gave Barcelona the lead before England youth midfielder Nico O'Reilly, 19, equalised, for Pep Guardiola's side against his former one.\n\nGrealish, who admitted he was \"heartbroken\" to miss out on the England squad, then levelled things up once more after Pablo Torre had restored Barcelona's lead. Penalties followed but it was the Spanish side who were victorious, winning 4-1 after both Kalvin Phillips and Jacob Wright had their shots saved. The defeat was the third in a row for City, who have also been beaten by AC Milan and Celtic, but Guardiola is taking the positives.\n\n\"Every game we are getting better - our condition is getting better,\" he said. \"Rico [Lewis], again, thank you so much, Oscar [Bobb], Nico [O'Reilly]... all.

Erling Haaland's effort had earlier crossed the line but the officials didn't spot it, before O'Reilly latched onto a Josko Gvardiol pass to score smartly.\n\nPablo Torre scored on the stroke of half-time, before Mateo Kovacic's smart turn and run set up Jack Grealish for a much-needed goal, 24 hours after he spoke of wanting to prove people wrong.\n\nREAD MORE: Barcelona vs Man City highlights and reaction from Orlando\n\nREAD MORE: Man City vs Barcelona kick-off delayed as warning issued\n\nHere is how we rated the players at the Camping World Stadium:\n\nEderson\n\nCouldn't do much about the first goal, got a hand to the second. He was unconvincing against AC Milan and while this was better, it still wasn't Ederson at his best. 6\n\nRico Lewis\n\nRestored to right-back, Lewis was back to his classy self and displayed some silky footwork. Migrated into midfield in the second half. Having a good pre-season. 6\n\nJosko Gvardiol\n\nNaive for the first goal in his old position of centre-back, but the reverse pass for O'Reilly's equaliser was brilliant. 6\n\nKalvin Phillips\n\nUnder a lot of pressure having dropped into defence, and was a little wide for the Barcelona opener. But let's be fair - he was calm under pressure, kept position well and almost scored at the other end. 7\n\nJosh Wilson-Esbrand\n\nGood going forward, maybe absent for the second Barcelona goal. Holding left-back down well in the absence of senior players. 6\n\nMateo Kovacic\n\nThe midfield is just better when he is in it. The turn and run for Grealish's goal took six players out of the game. 7\n\nNico O'Reilly\n\nStill some mistakes, but he's growing into this tour nicely. A well-deserved and well-taken goal, with some important interceptions too. 7\n\nJames McAtee\n\nYou don't often notice McAtee, but he's often just doing the basics right. Covered defenders who went forward. Nice link-up with fellow frontmen. 6\n\nOscar Bobb\n\nA quieter game than his previous two friendlies, but still a threat. One skillful run almost yielded another assist. 6\n\nJack Grealish\n\nHe needed that goal. A few warnings in the first half went wide, until he kept calm and smashed into the top corner on the hour. Time to kick on now. 8\n\nErling Haaland\n\nHis outstretched leg diverted the ball over the line, but a lack of goalline technology deprived him of a third goal in three games. Replaced at half-time for the second game running. 7\n\nStefan Ortega (on 45)\n\nA couple of hairy moments but far enough away from goal. 6\n\nMaximo Perrone (on 45)\n\nDid nothing wrong, but didn't affect the game too much. 6\n\nMahamadou Susoho (on 65)\n\nAnother useful run-out in defensive midfield. 6\n\nCallum Doyle (on 65)\n\nOne great challenge to deny Robert Lewandowski. 6\n\nJacob Wright (on 65)\n\nInterchanged with Susoho. 6\n\nAmar Fatah (on 65)\n\nTwo or three really good runs into the box. 6\n\nLuke Mbete, Micah Hamilton, Jaden Heskey (75-85)\n\nAll did okay, not much time to get involved.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_bray@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Joe Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping_World_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camping World Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson-Esbrand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Wilson-Esbrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAtee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James McAtee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Seemingly no pre-season friendly in the United States is complete without a penalty shootout, however, allowing Hansi Flick to get one over Guardiola as La Blaugrana won 4-1 from the spot.\n\nHere's what we observed from the battle between two European giants.\n\nWith a few more prominent attackers still out of the picture, Oscar Bobb has taken the role of City's chief creator in pre-season like a duck to water.\n\nThe Norway international contributed a goal and three assists in his first two summer games and was electric once again in Orlando, creating four chances and whizzing past Barca defenders with his sensational dribbling.\n\nGuardiola could struggle to fit the 21-year-old into his starting XI regularly throughout the 2024/25 campaign but, having warned he expects his side to begin the campaign in slow fashion, an in-form Bobb could help fill the void before the likes of Jeremy Doku and Bernardo Silva are up to speed.\n\nCity winger Jack Grealish spoke about his immense disappointment at missing out on England's Euro 2024 squad before kick-off, admitting he wants to use the setback as motivation for an improved season.\n\nHe backed up his words with a clinical finish to draw the Premier League champions level, firing into the top corner after Mateo Kovacic turned defence into attack with a brilliant run from the edge of his area.\n\nThe former Aston Villa captain was poor in 2023/24 but his goal should boost his confidence tenfold.\n\nWhile City had suffered two defeats before Wednesday's meeting, it was Barca's first pre-season friendly of the summer. Given they were without a number of first-team stars due to injuries and Euro 2024 hangovers, Flick's side were impressive.\n\nThe Catalans pressured City into mistakes and took the lead when Marc Casado flicked through for Victor to finish confidently. Though O'Reilly equalised, Gerard Martin set up Torre to get Barca back ahead before half-time.\n\nFans were forced to endure a delay as kick-off was pushed back due to thunder and lightning and one would think a ground named the Camping World Stadium would be equipped well enough to deal with such 'inclement weather'.\n\nThe game eventually got underway 80 minutes late after fans huddled under the shelter of concrete stands watching the furious rain fall.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Results are meaningless as City prepare for the 24/25 season. But the champions also don't want to pick up any injuries during their games in the United States. With this in mind, Pep Guardiola revealed after City's penalty shootout defeat to Barcelona that Erling Haaland is being managed through City's pre-season friendlies.\n\nSpeaking with the media post-game in an interview that was relayed by Jack Gaughan for the Daily Mail following City's defeat to Barcelona, Guardiola revealed that his star striker is currently dealing with 'muscle discomfort'. Guardiola told the media that he wasn't prepared to take any risk with Erling Haaland. He explained: \"Erling is not comfortable. We don't want to take risks. But sooner or later he has to take a step with training and minutes. The season is there, around the corner. He has niggles, muscular, we don't want to take a risk and lose him for three weeks or a month. That would be a problem.\"\n\nThe fitness of Erling Haaland is now a story to monitor ahead of the 24/25 season beginning. City's number 9 will have a huge role to play for Pep Guardiola's side next season. But he will be vitally important to Manchester City at the beginning of next season. City will have a plethora of first team players making a late start to the season. After their international exploits this summer players such as Julian Alvarez, Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku and more will have slow starts to next season. This makes players like Erling Haaland vital to Pep Guardiola at the beginning of the season.\n\nThe fitness of Erling Haaland is a concern for Manchester City. It is now a case of hoping that his 'discomfort' isn't too serious and he can hit the 24/25 season fit and ready to make an instant impact.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/esteemed_kompany_articles_332/6536e7be5e2b16cfd92c26f4db02d994", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775561", "eventUri": "eng-9775561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Both clubs, with rich histories and decorated trophy cabinets, are set to light up the stage at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, marking a significant prelude to their respective campaigns.\n\nScheduled for a midnight kick-off on July 31, 2024, UK viewers can gear up for a late-night football feast. The game will be broadcast live on Premier Sports 1, with coverage rolling just before the action unfolds. Additionally, the match can be streamed via the Premier Sports app and Manchester City's own streaming service, City+, available at a monthly fee.\n\nDespite their status as Premier League champions, Manchester City has had a turbulent start to their pre-season in the US. The team has suffered back-to-back defeats against Celtic and AC Milan, with a scoreline that reads more like a batting order than football results: four conceded against Celtic and three against Milan, while managing to net five across both games. This has occurred even with star names like Erling Haaland, Ederson, and Jack Grealish gracing the squad.\n\nOn the other side, Barcelona is embarking on a fresh chapter with Hansi Flick at the helm. This match will be Flick's debut as the head coach of Barcelona, setting the stage for his tactical imprint on the team. While the squad will miss several key players due to post-international duty rest, the likes of Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will still feature, ensuring quality remains high on the pitch.\n\nFor City, eyes will be on Ederson, likely to start after his appearance against AC Milan, and young talents like Josh Wilson-Esbrand and Rico Lewis, who are expected to be given more game time. Erling Haaland's presence always adds an extra layer of threat upfront.\n\nBarcelona will see late returns for Raphinha, Ilkay Gundogan, and Jules Kounde, with this game providing a platform for other talents to shine and stake a claim in Flick's considerations.\n\nGiven City's leaky defence in the earlier matches and their capability to score, coupled with Barcelona's new tactical approach under Flick, another high-scoring affair seems likely. Both teams will be eager to iron out defensive frailties while also showcasing their attacking flair.\n\nThis pre-season friendly between Barcelona and Manchester City is more than just a warm-up. It's a clash of titans, each with something to prove, and each looking to lay down a marker for the season ahead. With both teams not at full strength, it offers a chance for emerging stars to shine and seasoned players to refine their form. As the football world watches, this encounter promises to be a thrilling display of football prowess.\n\nIn essence, this game is not just a test of pre-season progress but a statement of intent from both European giants. With tactical narratives unfolding and new strategies being tested, the Camping World Stadium is set to host a match that could offer a glimpse into the future tactics and star performers of the upcoming football season.

Seemingly no pre-season friendly in the United States is complete without a penalty shootout, however, allowing Hansi Flick to get one over Guardiola as La Blaugrana won 4-1 from the spot.\n\nHere's what we observed from the battle between two European giants.\n\nWith a few more prominent attackers still out of the picture, Oscar Bobb has taken the role of City's chief creator in pre-season like a duck to water.\n\nThe Norway international contributed a goal and three assists in his first two summer games and was electric once again in Orlando, creating four chances and whizzing past Barca defenders with his sensational dribbling.\n\nGuardiola could struggle to fit the 21-year-old into his starting XI regularly throughout the 2024/25 campaign but, having warned he expects his side to begin the campaign in slow fashion, an in-form Bobb could help fill the void before the likes of Jeremy Doku and Bernardo Silva are up to speed.\n\nCity winger Jack Grealish spoke about his immense disappointment at missing out on England's Euro 2024 squad before kick-off, admitting he wants to use the setback as motivation for an improved season.\n\nHe backed up his words with a clinical finish to draw the Premier League champions level, firing into the top corner after Mateo Kovacic turned defence into attack with a brilliant run from the edge of his area.\n\nThe former Aston Villa captain was poor in 2023/24 but his goal should boost his confidence tenfold.\n\nWhile City had suffered two defeats before Wednesday's meeting, it was Barca's first pre-season friendly of the summer. Given they were without a number of first-team stars due to injuries and Euro 2024 hangovers, Flick's side were impressive.\n\nThe Catalans pressured City into mistakes and took the lead when Marc Casado flicked through for Victor to finish confidently. Though O'Reilly equalised, Gerard Martin set up Torre to get Barca back ahead before half-time.\n\nWhile more experienced campaigners like Robert Lewandowski, Inigo Martinez and Oriol Romeu made appearances from the bench, it was youngsters Noah Darvich, Alejandro Balde and Antonio Fernandez who netted from the penalty spot alongside Lewandowski to help Barca end the night on top.\n\nGet the irony?\n\nFans were forced to endure a delay as kick-off was pushed back due to thunder and lightning and one would think a ground named the Camping World Stadium would be equipped well enough to deal with such 'inclement weather'.\n\nThe game eventually got underway 80 minutes late after fans huddled under the shelter of concrete stands watching the furious rain fall.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

A group of fans were uninterested in the likes of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish training directly in front of them, and only interested in getting Kaka to notice them.\n\nHe retired in 2017 but is still a star attraction here seven years on. Kaka and Pep Guardiola held a long conversation before the City boss eventually walked out to oversee training. Kaka joins Joe Mazzulla, Andre Agassi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the list of sporting legends who have spent time with Guardiola on tour this summer.\n\nALSO READ: I saw what Grealish really thought about England snub - it speaks volumes for Man City\n\nALSO READ: Pep Guardiola delivers blunt transfer message to Alvarez and admits De Bruyne could still leave Man City\n\nGuardiola had just spoken to a packed media theatre ahead of the Barcelona game - taking as many questions in Spanish and Catalan as in English. He offered a stern assessment of Julian Alvarez's comments that the striker wants to play more important games and that he has to think about his future.\n\nThe manager's message: fine, think about it. When he has thought about it, let us know. The unspoken message was that he wasn't particularly happy at having heard the comments which seem to have been misinterpreted.\n\nThere was backing for Jack Grealish too, who had just spoken for the first time about his omission from the England squad this summer. He said he was heartbroken at the snub, that he struggled to get over it, and alluded to off-field problems that were simmering in the background last season.\n\nGrealish also insisted he would make no excuses for his form in 2024. He wants to prove people wrong and use his heartbreak as motivation. The forward signed an Aston Villa shirt after training and asked if the fan in question still liked him.\n\nTraining was interesting, too, with a possible new tactic being explored.\n\nJosko Gvardiol is back with the group and came off the bench at the Yankee Stadium at the weekend. He looks in line to start vs Barcelona in Orlando as City coaches experiment with a new-look back line.\n\nIn a drill to practice positioning with the defence and midfield, Josh Wilson-Esbrand was the left-back and Rico Lewis was switched back to the right, with Gvardiol in the middle rather than at left-back. Mateo Kovacic is back as well and has taken his place at the base of midfield, with Nico O'Reilly next to him.\n\nThe other centre-back in the drill was Kalvin Phillips - who has struggled in his two appearances in defensive midfield this summer, and across his two years at the club. He was used at centre-back in his first pre-season as City had no senior options, but has not featured there since. In the drill, Phillips was asked to push into midfield during the press, as the back four adapted into a back three to cover.\n\nGvardiol arrived as a centre-back but has rarely played there for City, and was practicing the same pressing movement. It could be a useful run-out if he is selected in the middle.\n\nWhether Guardiola goes with that makeshift back four against Barcelona remains to be seen. If Phillips drops back, however, that will be another step in his long journey to find a role in the team that is still no closer than when he last played in defence.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_bray@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Joe Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kak\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kak\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson-Esbrand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Wilson-Esbrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29643352.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2163344168.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775561", "eventUri": "eng-9775561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

His frustration was palpable, but he was ready to prove himself on the field.\n\nFrom the start, he was aggressive, nearly scoring twice early on. His moment of redemption came when Mateo Kovacic's skilful run set him up to score from a powerful short into the top corner.\n\nInstead of an exuberant celebration, Grealish's restrained reaction -- a fist pump -- spoke volumes about his pent-up emotions and desire to let his performance do the talking.\n\nAll the latest EPL club news | Team-by-team Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings\n\nThe match was more than just a showcase for Grealish. Erling Haaland, returning from a restful summer, was also in fine form. Although denied a goal due to a lack of goal-line technology, Haaland's presence was felt throughout the game.\n\nHe played a supportive role, notably when he applauded young midfielder Nico O'Reilly's first senior goal. O'Reilly, demonstrating poise beyond his years, made a smart run and finished from a pass by Josko Gvardiol, marking a memorable moment for the youngster.\n\nManchester City's attack looked promising, with fluid play involving Oscar Bobb and James McAtee, who linked well with Grealish and right-back Rico Lewis.\n\nHowever, City's defence was less solid, conceding two goals by halftime. Victor Pau and Pablo Torre took advantage of the makeshift centre-back pairing of Gvardiol and Kalvin Phillips, exposing vulnerabilities that need addressing before the season starts.\n\nDespite the defensive lapses, City's offensive performance in Orlando was their best of the tour, with players showing they are ready for the upcoming challenges.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping_World_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camping World Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAtee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James McAtee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-line_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal-line technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/GettyImages-2164541243.jpg?itok=cqQ_QO4z", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775561", "eventUri": "eng-9775561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

To date, players such as Oscar Bobb, Rico Lewis, Callum Doyle Maximo Perrone and more have impressed at stages of City's pre-season friendlies. But during Manchester City's penalty shootout defeat to Barcelona Nico O'Reilly put in a quality display. The youngster appears to have the tools to make an impact for Manchester City either this season or in the future based on his showings in the US.\n\nNico O'Reilly is yet another impressive prospect to rise through City's academy. The young midfielder looks to have all of the necessary tools to eventually graduate into City's first team. He is a technically sound player which is a prerequisite to play for Pep Guardiola's side. O'Reilly also has the intelligence required to play in midfield for the world champions. While he is young he looks to have a maturity to his game that is beyond his years. That has stood out during his appearances for City in the US. Nico O'Reilly also has size in his favour which makes him a player who looks ready to potentially play a role for Pep Guardiola this season.\n\nO'Reilly also has an eye for goal and the ability to make late runs into the box. That was evident when equalised for Manchester City during the first half against Barcelona. The type of run made by the youngster was reminiscent of Ilkay Gundogan in his prime. That ability is another standout attribute for O'Reilly. He also looks to have the versatility to play in multiple positions across midfield, which is another must-have attribute for Manchester City players. All told Nico O'Reilly could be the complete package in midfield as he further develops in time.\n\nSpeaking after City's friendly against Barcelona Pep Guardiola was full of praise for Nico O'Reilly. Guardiola believes that O'Reilly has the potential to help his team. He explained: \"He had a long injury last season, and he came back in the middle and trained with us and I said Wow, this guy has good things. He's a good leader, so strong in the duel and small spaces good. In attacking midfield he arrives well, and when holding he can too. I'm pretty sure he can play a role as a holding midfielder. He can do it. We have Kalvin [Phillips and Kova[cic] who played incredibly well and Nico. I know he can play, it's difficult to sustain 90 minutes but he can help us because he's a player with a lot of quality.\"\n\nOne of the major themes of Manchester City's pre-season tour of the United States was which City youngsters would impress. Nico O'Reilly is one who has stood out and potentially earmarked himself as a player for the future and potentially this season for Manchester City.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/esteemed_kompany_articles_332/37b3f145f23f88fb16eb39902d0b5457", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775561", "eventUri": "eng-9775561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

It feels slightly odd that it has taken the teenager this long to emerge as a first-team possibility - he made the bench for a Premier League game the season before last - but after injuries have stalled his progress it has been an encouraging trip for O'Reilly.\n\nMore senior colleagues have had more attention. Kalvin Phillips has tried and really failed to make the most of his midfield auditions, while James McAtee has bubbled under the surface as he attempts to secure his place in Pep Guardiola's squad for the coming season.\n\nREAD MORE: What Grealish did after Man City goal vs Barcelona shows his true colours\n\nREAD MORE: Man City player ratings vs Barcelona as Grealish and Phillips good\n\nWith those bigger pictures in the building of Guardiola's group, it has gone slightly unnoticed that O'Reilly has started in all three of City's friendlies in the United States. Not only that, he has been utilised in all three midfield positions and done well in all of them.\n\nHe saved his best for Barcelona though. \"He was phenomenal today.,\" said Shaun Wright-Phillips after the game. \"Everything he did seemed like it was what he wanted to do and it was in the right direction.\"\n\nO'Reilly is still likely to be behind McAtee, Oscar Bobb and all of the other senior midfielders that will return to training next week. However, Guardiola spoke recently of up to five youngsters who are of interest at the moment and O'Reilly may well have played his way into the first team plans; if he is happy with that, there is no reason why he shouldn't be looking for occasional minutes off the bench towards the end of Premier League games and bigger roles in cup matches.\n\nCity need to find a way to navigate more games this season with the expanded Champions League and Club World Cup, and if there won't be new additions in the market the pressure on the first team will have to be released by the academy.\n\nSummer tours see plenty of breakout stars from the academy who show Guardiola enough that they go on to play a significant role in the season ahead. Bobb has been the standout so far, but under the radar O'Reilly could see lasting rewards from his efforts on tour.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_bajkowski@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Bajkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAtee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James McAtee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Wright-Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaun Wright-Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29646516.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2163962225.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775561", "eventUri": "eng-9775561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Haaland, who has won the Golden Boot in his two years at the club, is having to play limited minutes during pre-season.\n\nSeveral of his team-mates have got longer runs but Haaland has been managed more acutely with Guardiola readying him for more action, but all while trying to avoid a scenario where the Norwegian is sidelined for a number of weeks.\n\nHe said: \"Erling is not comfortable. We don't want to take risks. But sooner or later he has to take a step with training and minutes. The season is there, around the corner. He has niggles, muscular, we don't want to take a risk and lose him for three weeks or a month. That would be a problem.\"\n\nHaaland thought he'd scored during the 2-2 draw with Barcelona before the linesman and insisted his effort had not crossed the line. Oscar Bobb had excelled in the contest and Guardiola claims the youngster could be a forward option if Haaland is sidelined.\n\n\"He didn't feel good and that's why he didn't play the second half,\" said the Catalan. \"Sixty-seventy per cent of the squad are on holiday. That's why we need the players. At the same time, we have alternatives, Oscar makes an incredible job again. We're pleased with many things.\"\n\nCity are yet to claim victory across the Atlantic after losing to Celtic and AC Milan before drawing with the Spanish giants. They face neighbours Manchester United in the Community Shield a week on Saturday before kicking off their Premier League defence at Chelsea.\n\nGuardiola is eyeing a fifth successive league triumph with City, which would further etch their name into the history books. The ex-Bayern Munich boss became the first man to win four on the bounce just months ago and has hinted he could extend his stay at the Etihad.\n\nHe said: \"We will see what happens. But I will not rule it out absolutely to extend my contract. I would love to stay because I would love to stay. Nine years today in the same club is an eternity. So I want to be sure it's the right decision. Not just for me, for the club, for the players.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

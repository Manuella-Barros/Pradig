Won't he? Who knows!\n\nPhilippe Coutinho's future at Liverpool remains up in the air with just two weeks of the transfer window reamining.\n\nBarcelona are determined to spend their Neymar cash on new additions and will keep working until the end of the window to try and get the deal over the line.\n\nBut where is the deal up to now? With so many new lines emerging every day, Mirror Football has rounded up the latest situation.\n\nSo, without further ado, here's what we know...\n\nTHE FACTS... Coutinho wants to leave\n\nSorry, Liverpool fans. There's no getting away from the fact of the matter.\n\nBy handing in a transfer request earlier this month, Coutinho confirmed that he did indeed want to leave for Barcelona.\n\nThere is a perception that Coutinho believes that if he cannot secure the move away this summer, he might never get to go - and that is why he is actively trying to secure the move this summer.\n\nLiverpool emphatic that they don't want to sell\n\nThe said transfer request was firmly rejected by Liverpool.\n\nAt the same time, Liverpool turned down two separate offers for his services - one being as large as \u00a390million.\n\n\"It's not that I don't want to talk about it, it's that I can't change my answers - because there is nothing else to say,\" Jurgen Klopp said with almost a grimace in his most recent press conference.\n\n\"If they [Barcelona] say they will bid whatever money, we don't want it. It is a clear message. The owners are 100 per cent clear on it.\n\n\"We don't want money, we want to invest in the team and have the best team because we have our aims and dreams. That is the message.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Barcelona remain keen to do the deal\n\nBarcelona want to reinvest the cash from the deal to sell Neymar back into their squad.\n\nWhile they are closing in on a deal for Borussia Dortmund forward Ousmane Dembele, Barca are also hopeful of landing Coutinho as they bid to make up for the loss of one of their star players.\n\nThey have seen two approaches turned down by Liverpool, but don't appear set to give up on the fight.\n\nCoutinho is injured - but remains in training\n\nCoutinho cut a glum figure when he arrived for training at Melwood earlier this week.\n\nHe remains based at Liverpool's training ground as he recovers from a back problem.\n\nThat, according to Liverpool boss Klopp, is the only reason why he has been absent from the Premier League game against Watford and Champions League play-off with Hoffenheim.\n\nCoutinho last played for Liverpool in the Audi Cup pre-season game against Bayern Munich.\n\nLiverpool have removed Coutinho posters\n\nFootage posted on Twitter has showed a member of staff taking down the giant image of Coutinho from the front window of the official Liverpool store in the city centre's Williamson Square.\n\nHowever, it seems the reason for the window display was something more mundane.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo reports that ALL players, plus manager Klopp, were taken down in preparation for their Autumn fashion launch which begins on Monday.\n\nSo it's probably best wait to see if Coutinho is included in that launch before jumping to any conclusions.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now THE RUMOURS... Coutinho could sacrifice Brazil World Cup place\n\nIt has been suggested that Coutinho is so intent on leaving the club, he is even willing to risk his place in Brazil's squad for next summer's World Cup.\n\nMundo Deportivo reports that Coutinho is ready to sit in the stands for the remainder of the season if the club do not agree to his departure.\n\nWhile he believes that he has acted professionally throughout the summer, he is reportedly ready to ramp up his efforts to secure the move and put the pressure on Liverpool.\n\nBarca are struggling to land alternatives\n\nBarcelona have been knocked back by Napoli after bidding \u00a355m (\u20ac60m) for Lorenzo Insigne.\n\nLiverpool had considered the Italy international as a potential replacement for Coutinho, if he departs.\n\nThat has put the Blaugrana head-to-head with the Reds for Insigne, report Gazzetta dello Sport .\n\nWhile they are still clearly keen on Coutinho and Dembele, Barca are clearly looking at other alternatives with just two weeks of the window remaining.\n\nEl Clasico defeat could accelerate Barca's movements\n\nThe El Clasico defeat to Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup has reportedly put new life into Barca's exploits.\n\nThe 5-1 aggregate reverse against Real looks set to force them into accelerating their transfer business, with added emphasis on the Coutinho and Dembele deals.\n\nSport claim that club officials were so disappointed with the nature of the defeat that they were prepared to go all out in securing the necessary additions.\n\nIf Coutinho does leave...\n\nJurgen Klopp has lined up German star Max Meyer to replace Coutinho, should Liverpool cave in to Barcelona's demands.\n\nA \u00a360m move for Lorenzo Insigne is the first target, though the 21-year-old German attacking midfielder has been a long-term target.\n\nThe Germany international rejected a contract offer to stay at Schalke and only has a year left on his contract.\n\nAnd sources close to the highly-talented German star suggest he'd be open to teaming up with Klopp who tried to sign him as a teenager when the Kop boss managed Borussia Dortmund.\n\npoll loading Will Philippe Coutinho still be a Liverpool player on September 1?

AP\n\nSporting director Robert Fernandez was less emphatic when asked about the deals later, although he was optimistic that both will soon be Barcelona players.\n\n\"Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time,\" said Fernandez at the unveiling of Brazil midfielder Paulinho, a \u00a336.4 million signing from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande.\n\n\"They have the conditions, the age and could adapt to our football. They would be good to have here. That's the reality.\"\n\nUnder pressure to spend big after pocketing a world record 222 million euros from Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar, Barcelona have already had a \u00a390 million bid for 25-year-old Brazilian attacking midfielder Coutinho rejected by Liverpool.\n\nSpanish media have also reported that Barcelona are prepared to pay an initial 80 million euros, plus 40 million in bonuses, to Borussia Dortmund for 20-year-old French winger Dembele.\n\nFernandez added: \"With respect to Liverpool and Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves.\n\n\"We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but (I) do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers.\"\n\nLiverpool and Dortmund have both been adamant that their respective players are not for sale, with the Premier League club's manager Jurgen Klopp insisting that no discussions are ongoing with Barcelona.\n\n\"No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this,\" said Klopp on Thursday.\n\nSuarez sidelined\n\nCoutinho, currently sidelined with a back injury, last week handed in a transfer request that was turned down by Liverpool's American owners.\n\nThere have been suggestions Coutinho could agitate for a move by effectively going on strike, but while he is still injured that is impossible.\n\nKlopp conceded it is a tricky situation for all parties, but was keen not to be seen criticising the Brazilian's attitude.\n\n\"To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast to Coutinho, Dembele has been suspended indefinitely by Dortmund after skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him.\n\nHe will not play in his current side's opening Bundesliga game against Wolfsburg this weekend but Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished the claims made by Segura.\n\n\"Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one-millimetre closer,\" Watzke told German magazine Kicker.\n\nDembele, 20, was signed from Rennes just last year and has a contract until 2021.\n\nBarcelona are eager to complete the signings with their opening game of the season in La Liga coming at home to Betis on Sunday.\n\nThe 2-0 defeat to Madrid on Wednesday saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup 5-1 on aggregate and also saw them lose Luis Suarez to injury.\n\nThe Uruguayan striker suffered a knee injury in the game that means he will be out for around a month, ruling him out of Barca's first three league games and their first Champions League group match.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 10:44 pm |

Two Barcelona offers - the second of \u00a390million - have been rejected.\n\nThus, in a bid to force a move Coutinho has handed in a transfer request at Anfield. And Ayestaran believes \"he ticks all the boxes\" for the Catalan club.\n\n\"Barca simply need a player like Coutinho, both tactically and for his quality. From a tactical point of view, I think he is a perfect fit,\" Ayestaran told The Independent.\n\n\"They have already lost Xavi while Andres Iniesta is already in the latter stages of his career so will play less, and they thereby don't manage to control the ball in the middle of the pitch in the same way, or make it arrive for the forwards at the right pace. They have lost that. Coutinho can offer this, he ticks all the boxes, and especially those penetrating passes.\n\n\"Liverpool's game last year was all about attackers alternating positions so much, and it was often down to Coutinho to choose the right tempo of the play. He is also probably a better positional player than a player on the break, as he gives the right angles for passing options, his body shape is good, and he always chooses the right option.\"\n\nLiverpool have so far rejected two offers from the Spanish side for the Brazil international and continue to insist that he is going nowhere.\n\nBarcelona general manager Pep Segura declared on Wednesday night that a deal was 'close' for Coutinho, and also Ousmane Dembele.\n\n\"We are close to Coutinho and Dembele, we are discussing their conditions but we do not know when they will be sealed,\" said Segura.\n\nDortmund have laughed off that suggestion regarding the Frenchman while Liverpool have similarly distanced themselves from Segura's claim.\n\nReds boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking on Thursday, said there was \"nothing new\" regarding a potential departure.\n\npoll loading Will Philippe Coutinho still be a Liverpool player on September 1? 44000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T13:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2567, "textStart": 2556, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-01", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "13:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "74", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "163729", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 4}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 3}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "305813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305878", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Independent on Sunday"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "score": 3}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 4}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "331554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "score": 4}, {"id": "393292", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "432837", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "score": 2}], "image": "http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10944503.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Wigan-Athletic-v-Liverpool-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:00:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Why Philippe Coutinho is \"perfect\" for Barcelona", "originalArticle": null}

They would be good to have here. That's the reality.\"\n\nUnder pressure to spend big after pocketing a world record 222 million euros from Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar, Barcelona have already had a \u00a390 million bid for 25-year-old Brazilian attacking midfielder Coutinho rejected by Liverpool.\n\nSpanish media have also reported that Barcelona are prepared to pay an initial 80 million euros, plus 40 million in bonuses, to Borussia Dortmund for 20-year-old French winger Dembele.\n\nFernandez added: \"With respect to Liverpool and Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves.\n\n\"We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but (I) do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers.\"\n\nLiverpool and Dortmund have both been adamant that their respective players are not for sale, with the Premier League club's manager Jurgen Klopp insisting that no discussions are ongoing with Barcelona.\n\n\"No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this,\" said Klopp on Thursday.\n\n- Suarez sidelined -\n\nCoutinho, currently sidelined with a back injury, last week handed in a transfer request that was turned down by Liverpool's American owners.\n\nThere have been suggestions Coutinho could agitate for a move by effectively going on strike, but while he is still injured that is impossible.\n\nKlopp conceded it is a tricky situation for all parties, but was keen not to be seen criticising the Brazilian's attitude.\n\n\"To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast to Coutinho, Dembele has been suspended indefinitely by Dortmund after skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him.\n\nHe will not play in his current side's opening Bundesliga game against Wolfsburg this weekend but Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished the claims made by Segura.\n\n\"Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one millimetre closer,\" Watzke told German magazine Kicker.\n\nDembele, 20, was signed from Rennes just last year and has a contract until 2021.\n\nBarcelona are eager to complete the signings with their opening game of the season in La Liga coming at home to Betis on Sunday.\n\nThe 2-0 defeat to Madrid on Wednesday saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup 5-1 on aggregate and also saw them lose Luis Suarez to injury.\n\nThe Uruguayan striker suffered a knee injury in the game that means he will be out for around a month, ruling him out of Barca's first three league games and their first Champions League group match.\n\nShares", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T17:05:00Z",

have publicly stated that Coutinho is not for sale at any price and consider the figures being offered by Barcelona irrelevant.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazil playmaker, currently sidelined by a back problem, has submitted a transfer request.\n\nHe signed a new five-year contract in January.\n\nBarcelona have targeted Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund winger Ousmane Dembele to plug the gap created by Neymar's world-record \u20ac222 million (RM1.138 billion) move to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Barca general manager Pep Segura said deals for the pair were \"close.\"\n\nBut Liverpool are refusing to budge and Dembele, 20, has been suspended by Dortmund after going on strike in a bid to force through a move.\n\nCoutinho joined Liverpool from Inter Milan in an \u00a38.5

They would be good to have here. That's the reality.\"\n\nUnder pressure to spend big after pocketing a world record 222 million euros from Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar, Barcelona have already had a \u00a390 million bid for 25-year-old Brazilian attacking midfielder Coutinho rejected by Liverpool.\n\nSpanish media have also reported that Barcelona are prepared to pay an initial 80 million euros, plus 40 million in bonuses, to Borussia Dortmund for 20-year-old French winger Dembele.\n\nFernandez added: \"With respect to Liverpool and Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves.\n\n\"We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but (I) do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers.\"\n\nLiverpool and Dortmund have both been adamant that their respective players are not for sale, with the Premier League club's manager Jurgen Klopp insisting that no discussions are ongoing with Barcelona.\n\n\"No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this,\" said Klopp on Thursday.\n\n- Suarez sidelined -\n\nCoutinho, currently sidelined with a back injury, last week handed in a transfer request that was turned down by Liverpool's American owners.\n\nThere have been suggestions Coutinho could agitate for a move by effectively going on strike, but while he is still injured that is impossible.\n\nKlopp conceded it is a tricky situation for all parties, but was keen not to be seen criticising the Brazilian's attitude.\n\n\"To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast to Coutinho, Dembele has been suspended indefinitely by Dortmund after skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him.\n\nHe will not play in his current side's opening Bundesliga game against Wolfsburg this weekend but Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished the claims made by Segura.\n\n\"Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one millimetre closer,\" Watzke told German magazine Kicker.\n\nDembele, 20, was signed from Rennes just last year and has a contract until 2021.\n\nBarcelona are eager to complete the signings with their opening game of the season in La Liga coming at home to Betis on Sunday.\n\nThe 2-0 defeat to Madrid on Wednesday saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup 5-1 on aggregate and also saw them lose Luis Suarez to injury.\n\nThe Uruguayan striker suffered a knee injury in the game that means he will be out for around a month, ruling him out of Barca's first three league games and their first Champions League group match.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:47:00Z",

There is nothing bad to say about this.\n\n\"We are all not silly. We know it is a very difficult situation but there is nothing new to say.\n\n\"It is not always easy for me to say the 100 per cent truth - even though I don't like to lie - but it is exactly how I say it because that is how it is in the moment, nothing else.\"\n\nAfter Barca's Spanish Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid, Segura said: \"We are close to Coutinho and Dembele.\n\n\"We are discussing their deals but do not know when it will be done.\"\n\nAsked if he expected them to sign, Segura added: \"Yes, we expect it.\"\n\nBut fellow Barcelona chief Robert Fernandez says the deal for Coutinho is more difficult because he does not have a release clause.\n\nThe sporting director said: \"Any team looking for top quality players are getting involved in a very difficult situation in this market.\n\n\"Why? Because the market is where clubs like us want to sign top quality players. There's no buy-out clauses so that makes things trickier.\n\n\"Yes, we are negotiating with clubs to make several signings, but in all awareness of the difficulty. We need to work our way into a favourable situation and hopefully close these deals as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time. They have the conditions, the right age and could adapt to our football. They would be good to have here.\"\n\nDortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke also hit out at Segura's claims.\n\nWatzke said: \"I don't know why he said that. Barcelona is not one step closer to signing Dembele.\n\n\"I can not explain what he is telling me.

Fernandez added that the club had been hampered because Liverpool did not have a buy-out clause in Coutinho's deal.\n\n\"Not just Barca but any team looking for top quality players are getting involved in a very difficult situation in this market,\" he said.\n\n\"Why? Because the market is where clubs like us want to sign top quality players. There's no buy-out clauses so that makes things trickier.\n\n\"Yes, we are negotiating with clubs to make several signings, but in all awareness of the difficulty. We need to work our way into a favourable situation and hopefully close these deals as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time. They have the conditions, the right age and could adapt to our football. They would be good to have here. That's the reality.\n\n\"With respect to Liverpool and Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves.\n\n\"We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers.\"\n\nThose comments come after the Catalan club's general manager, Josep Segura, told TV3: \" We are discussing the conditions of Coutinho and Dembele. We are close, obviously, but as long as we don't have the deal closed, we cannot say anything.\"\n\nWhen asked if he believed if the pair would both move to Barcelona this summer, Segura replied: \"We hope.\"\n\nBarcelona is trying to reinvest the 222 million euros ($262 million) it received from Paris Saint-Germain when the French club signed Brazil striker Neymar.\n\nChallenge your mates in Fox Sports Premier League Fantasy, and you could win FREE FOXTEL. Select your team now!\n\n\"I don't know why other people are saying what they're saying. I don't even know him. I have never met him,\" Klopp said, referring to Segura.\n\n\"We have already said what we have to say. [There is] no news from me. Nobody told me anything different since we spoke last time.\"\n\nWhen asked if Coutinho's absence against Crystal Palace was due to his back injury, Klopp replied: \"I think so. I've not been told any different.\n\n\"That is always how it is with injured players. I don't know when he will be back. There's nothing new.\"\n\nReports in the Spanish press have suggested Coutinho would be willing to go on strike in order to push through a move to the Nou Camp.\n\nKlopp insists the Brazilian has remained professional despite the ongoing transfer speculation, although he admits he has not spoke with the 25-year-old since he suffered his back injury.\n\n\"To be honest there is nothing I can say about his attitude because since he has the back problems he's not been in training,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"But when I asked the medical department how he is doing, there was no complaints. That's how it is. There's nothing bad to say.\"\n\nOne of the contingencies linked with Liverpool has been West Ham's Manuel Lanzini.\n\nBut Hammers boss Slaven Bilic has said: \"I speak to Manu every day. He is very happy, he feels at home here and he feels wanted.\n\n\"You can feel it, you can see it. I don't have to talk to him. You see how he is smiling here.\"\n\nThe West Ham boss believes playing regularly for West Ham in a World Cup year means Lanzini is happy to stay in east London.\n\n\"He broke into the national team of Argentina despite being injured, he got a call up for the September games. So he knows if he is playing here for West Ham and has a good season, he can improve, sign a better contract with West Ham and play for Argentina,\" said Bilic.\n\nMeanwhile, club legend Phil Thompson has told the club to hang onto Coutinho this window - but - make sure contingencies are being plotted to ease the transition when he goes.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"The ideal resolution is that the club will leave it very late and get as much as they can for him. If he doesn't want to stay then I'd rather see him sold for the best price, but the big issue is that there won't be any players near is quality on the market.\n\n\"It's probably too late in the window to get somebody in, so I think they'll keep him for a season. Coutinho might argue that Barcelona won't be there again but if you believe you're a top player then a top club will always be interested.\n\n\"I think the owners will hold firm. They've backed themselves into a corner with the statements they've made along with Jurgen Klopp's comments, so I just don't see how they can go back on that, especially when the fans are already quite unhappy with the summer transfer business as deals for Virgil van Dijk and Naby Keita are looking increasingly unlikely.\n\n\"The comments coming out from Barca saying that a deal is close might be a red flag to a bull, making the owners, who are adamant because of the deal they gave him six months ago, even more focused on standing their ground, so I think they will keep him.\"\n\nHe added: \"What they can do is try to find somebody out there, maybe even play Barcelona at their own game and say you can have Coutinho but we want Luis Suarez.\n\n\"Suarez might be unhappy with the Neymar situation. You don't know whether a player is unhappy or a club are willing to sell until you ask the question.\n\n\"They could go after Dele Alli, who was a Liverpool supporter as a kid. Tottenham are a bit like Liverpool in that there's always a price on a player.\n\n\"Sergio Aguero is another player that might be interested if he's not happy at Manchester City, but it comes back to being late in the window and that is the difficult situation Liverpool find themselves in.\n\n\"Signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be a start and would be available for the right money with his contract situation at Arsenal, but the club need to be ready to move if they do sell so we're not caught short.\"\n\nSo far, Barcelona has been limited to convincing Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande to part with Brazil midfielder Paulinho for 40 million euros ($47 million).\n\nThe 29-year-old Paulinho signed a four-year contract on Thursday, three days before Barcelona opens the Spanish league season against Real Betis.\n\nPaulinho was considered a disappointment when he played for English club Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Guangzhou in 2015.\n\nHe said at his presentation at Camp Nou that he had recovered his confidence in China.\n\n\"My first season in Tottenham was very good. In the second I couldn't play consistently,\" Paulinho said. \"Perhaps it wasn't my best season. Things didn't go as I would have liked. But that is the past. I accepted the challenge of playing in China and I won back both my desire and confidence there.\"\n\nPaulinho will be tasked with strengthening a Barcelona midfield that took a step back last season, a decline that stopped it from defending its Spanish league title.\n\nRead more at Sky Sports UK\n\nOriginally published as Ace that could save Reds, Klopp hits back at Barca", "dateTime":

We're close [to Coutinho and Dembele], we're talking about the conditions but until everything is finalised, we can't say anything else. We hope they will wear a Barca shirt.\"\n\nBarcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets reiterated his calls for fresh signings following the heavy defeat to Madrid on Wednesday night.\n\n\"It's clear signings are needed,\" Busquets said. \"We have to strengthen the squad. We need attacking players to compensate for Neymar.\n\n\"But every position can be strengthened and the more quality players that come in the better. I hope the best players arrive and that they generate competition and give the coach decisions to make.\"\n\nAlso See: Mignolet backs attacking style Liverpool grab first-leg lead 'Everyone wants Coutinho to stay' Premier League questions", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T06:33:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.686274528503418, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "06:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "110319", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "149322", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "163729", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 2}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 2}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "306405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "309177", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 2}, {"id": "339445", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "2002 FIFA World Cup qualification"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "score": 3}, {"id": "352078", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "score": 3}, {"id": "355134", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "score": 2}, {"id": "378425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ernesto Valverde"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Valverde", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 5}], "image": "http://e0.365dm.com/17/08/150x150/skysports-philippe-coutinho-liverpool-football_4068658.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Barcelona close to deals for Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele, claims Josep Segura", "originalArticle": null}

'We are discussing their deals but do not know when it will be done.'\n\nKlopp, who revealed that Daniel Sturridge was in contention to face Crystal Palace at Anfield this weekend, begged to differ when asked if there had been talks.\n\n'I am not sure I have to answer this only because we only said what we have to say, or the club said what we have to say,' he said.\n\n'Nothing to say. No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this.'\n\nKlopp insists there is nothing new to say on Coutinho, who is currently out with a back injury\n\nThe Liverpool manager suggested that there may be an element of smoke and mirrors surrounding the Coutinho situation.\n\n'We are all not silly,' he said. 'We know it is a very difficult situation but there is nothing new to say.\n\n'It is not always easy for me to say the 100 per cent truth - even though I don't like to lie - but it is exactly how I say it because that is how it is in the moment, nothing else.'\n\nCoutinho is currently out with a back injury, with no time-frame set for his return.\n\nKlopp said there were no issues over his attitude.\n\nKlopp claims that there is nothing wrong with Coutinho's attitude, despite his transfer request\n\n'To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,' Klopp said.\n\n'I asked the medical department how he is doing and there are no complaints so that is how it is. There is nothing bad to say about this. We are all not silly. We know it is a very difficult situation but there is nothing new to say.\n\n'It is not always easy for me to say the 100 per cent truth - even though I don't like to like - but it is exactly how I say it because that is how it is in the moment, nothing else.'\n\nWith regards to strengthening his own squad, Klopp confirmed that Liverpool are actively chasing targets.\n\nMeanwhile, Reds striker Daniel Sturridge is in contention to face Crystal Palace this weekend\n\n'We are looking but that is what I do when I am not actually on the pitch or not thinking about training or the next game,' Klopp explained.' Of course we think about what we can do.\n\n'But if the transfer window would have ended yesterday we already would have a team which I like and could play football with.\n\n'Of course, injuries here and there are not too cool but in this moment it is still a good team.'\n\nKlopp believes a hunt for fresh talent could go to the final day.\n\n'We will see what happens,' he said. 'I cannot change the answer because I don't know.\n\n'It is nothing like \"There is a contract, sign it\", a few things can happen on both sides but everything leads in the direction of August 31 and I can imagine it will be a busy day.

The former Liverpool academy technical manager was speaking after the club's 5-1 aggregate loss to Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday (16 August).\n\nThe La Liga side have thus far made four additions to the squad - Nelson Semedo, Gerard Deulofeu, Marlon Santos and Paulinho. But they lost a key player in Neymar, who joined Paris Saint-Germain in a world-record \u20ac222m (\u00a3198m) deal.\n\nBarcelona are now looking at alternatives to fill the void left by the Brazilian and have identified Dembele as the perfect replacement and have made contact with his current employers Borussia Dortmund about a move this summer. The German club have rejected the Spanish outfit's opening bid but are willing to sanction a move if their valuation of around \u20ac150m is met.\n\nThe Camp Nou outfit are said to have returned with an improved second bid and agreed a base fee of \u20ac100m (\u00a390.8m) but are yet to agree on the performance based add-ons with Dortmund asking for around \u20ac30m. Dembele is keen to move and is trying to force a move by skipping training, which has earned him a suspension.\n\nCoutinho, on the other hand, has been on Barcelona's radar since last season and a move for the Brazilian was planned before Neymar's departure. The La Liga club views the Liverpool midfielder as a long-term replacement for Andres Iniesta, who is in the final year of his contract.\n\nBarcelona have had a bid for Coutinho rejected by the Premier League side, and the Reds have made it clear that he is not for sale. But the former Inter Milan midfielder is keen on a move and has handed in a transfer request to force through a move to the Camp Nou this summer. The Spanish giants remain confident that they can reach an agreement with Liverpool.\n\n\"Coutinho and Dembele are both close. We are hopeful that they will end up wearing the Barca shirt,\" Segura said in the aftermath of Barcelona's disappointing loss to Real on Wednesday (16 August), as quoted by Goal.\n\n\"Until deals are closed I can't say anything. We know we have to help the team and reinforce it and that's what we are doing,\" the Barcelona general manager added.\n\nBarcelona manager Ernesto Valverde, meanwhile, was unsure if the deals for Dembele and Coutinho will be completed before the start of the La Liga season on 18 August. The Catalan club take on Real Betis in their opening game on Sunday (20 August).\n\n\"I don't know,\" was Valverde's response to the question about deals for Dembele and Coutinho being completed, as quoted by the Daily Mail.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T06:28:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 431, "date": "2017-08-16", "freq": 2, "textStart": 422, "amb": false, "imp": true}, {"textEnd": 2563, "textStart": 2554, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2643, "textStart": 2634, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "06:28:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "110319", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "163729", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 4}, {"id": "303119", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "score": 2}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305674", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "score": 4}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 3}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "308239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Santos FC"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC", "score": 3}, {"id": "309177", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "352078", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "score": 4}, {"id": "353435", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gerard Deulofeu"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Deulofeu", "score": 3}, {"id": "378425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ernesto Valverde"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Valverde", "score": 1}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "432837", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "score": 2}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1631359/philippe-coutinho.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:28:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Barcelona general manager confirms imminent deals for Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele", "originalArticle": null}

this transfer window while Borussia Dortmund suspended Dembele after the forward failed to show for training amid links with Barcelona.\n\nHowever, Segura expressed confidence deals for both players could be done before the transfer window closes.\n\nBorussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele is expected to join Coutinho at the Nou Camp (Bernd Thissen/dpa via AP)\n\n\"We are close to Coutinho and Dembele,\" he said on Catalan television station TV3. \"We are discussing their deals but do not know when it will be done.\"\n\nAsked if he expected them to sign, he added: \"Yes, we expect it.\"\n\nReports in Spain on Wednesday suggested Barca had agreed a fee with Dortmund for French winger Dembele.\n\nBarca are looking to replace Neymar following his shock world record transfer to Paris St Germain, and their need for reinforcements was apparent as they lost 2-0 to Madrid on Wednesday night, completing a 5-1 aggregate loss to the Spanish and European champions.\n\n\u1f604

German media have estimated the price of a move at more than 100 million euros.\n\nBarcelona are clearly in need of reinforcements after being outclassed in the Super Cup. After losing 3-1 at home on Sunday, Wednesday's 2-0 defeat came at the hands of a Madrid side minus Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Isco.\n\nSEARCH", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T05:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "05:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "110319", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "149322", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "score": 4}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 2}, {"id": "304742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Television station"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station", "score": 3}, {"id": "305674", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "score": 2}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 2}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "306405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "309177", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 4}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 4}], "image": "http://static.sify.com/cms/image/rirjdwaeeaihc_small.jpg", "timeCrawl": "05:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Soccer: Barca close to Coutinho, Dembele deals: Segura", "originalArticle": null}

It is nothing like 'There is a contract, sign it'.\n\n'A few things can happen on both sides (in and out) but everything leads in the direction of August 31 and I can imagine it will be a busy day.\n\n'If we are involved in this busy day I don't know but we will see.'", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T18:13:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2696, "textStart": 2687, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-31", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "18:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 1}, {"id": "304436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "304742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Television station"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station", "score": 3}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 4}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 4}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 2}, {"id": "306194", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "307959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "score": 2}, {"id": "311570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 5}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 3}, {"id": "330362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "331554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "score": 2}, {"id": "342435", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "score": 2}, {"id": "362476", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "score": 4}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "460422", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "score": 2}, {"id": "538637", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Adamant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamant", "score": 2}, {"id": "1269132", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Liverpool F.C. managers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Liverpool_F.C._managers", "score": 3}, {"id": "1281555", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dominic Solanke"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Solanke", "score": 2}, {"id": "1288974", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naby Ke\u00efta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naby_Ke\u00efta", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "15:29:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge back in training", "originalArticle": null}

Liverpool playmaker Coutinho submitted a transfer request via e-mail last Friday (11 August), while Borussia Dortmund starlet Dembele failed to turn up to training last week and has since been suspended by the German outfit.\n\nFernandez confirmed that Barcelona are in talks with Liverpool and Dortmund over the potential transfers of their star attackers and is keen to edge closer towards agreements in the coming days.\n\nThe Blaugrana are seemingly willing to pay north of \u00a3100m for the Brazil and France internationals, but Fernandez conceded that the futures of Coutinho and Dembele will be decided by Dortmund and Liverpool, who have no interest in parting with the former Inter Milan starlet.\n\n\"We are negotiating and that is the truth,\" Fernandez was quoted as saying by the Mirror. \"With all respect to both clubs, logically in a negotiation you need time to reach agreements for them and for us.\n\n\"We still have days ahead and we would like to go forward with this. It is true and I recognise this, that they are two players (Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele) we feel like bringing here.\"\n\n\"Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time. They have the conditions, the right age and could adapt to our football. They would be good to have here. That's the reality.\n\n\"With respect to Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, when there are negotiations you need time, you need to work things into a favourable situation for players and ourselves.\n\n\"We still have days ahead of us, would like to move things faster, but do admit they're two players we would like here. But it's the clubs who will have the final say on if we finally achieve those two transfers.\"\n\nBarcelona have already signed Paulinho, Gerard Deulofeu, Nelson Semedo and Marlon Santos this summer but Ernesto Valverde's men is still in need of major surgery due to the departure of Neymar, who joined Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a3198m two weeks ago.\n\nCoutinho and Dembele would go some way to remedying some of the issues that face the Catalan giants, but after recently suffering two chastening losses to Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup, Barca's woes are too great for the pair to completely solve, according to Luis Suarez.\n\n\"These two parties had little history and signings such as Dembele and Coutinho are not the solution,\" Suarez told Carrusel Deportivo.\n\n\"Barcelona have to know that united and together they have to fight to get out of this, whether or not there are new players.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:07:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 635,

Because the market is where clubs like us want to sign top quality players. There's no buy-out clauses so that makes things trickier.\n\n\"Yes, we are negotiating with clubs to make several signings, but in all awareness of the difficulty. We need to work our way into a favourable situation and hopefully close these deals as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Dembele and Coutinho are two important players that we like a lot and have done for a long time.

We are close, that is obvious, but until everything gets fully confirmed, you cannot say anything else.'\n\n\"Reading between the lines, he is trying to say - and I have spoken to all the relevant sources - that Barca want both players and they are in talks with their representatives. Not more than that. Even though if you take a sentence from it out of context it sounds different.\n\n\"It means they still need to do deals with the clubs and that will not be easy, in fact, it is far from being a close deal if you analyse the situation right now.\n\n\"Borussia has said that Barcelona have not got any close to their price tag for Dembele, \u20ac150m (\u00a3136m), and there is no price for Coutinho. That's where the situation is at the moment.\n\n\"Liverpool insist they will not sell and they have no intention of meeting Barca right now, despite all the false stories about meetings between clubs coming from the Catalan press, which the club have no influence about.\n\nCoutinho has been heavily linked with a move to the Nou Camp after handing in a transfer request at Anfield, with reports in the Catalan press suggesting a deal is now just days away, although Liverpool insist the Brazil international is not for sale and have already rejected two offers from Barcelona, the last one of \u00a390.4m.\n\nDortmund have turned down an identical offer for their France international Dembele, who is currently serving an internal suspension at the German club after missing training amid the speculation surrounding his future.\n\nBalague believes Segura's words infer that Barcelona are doing all they can to get the deals done, rather than any confirmation being close.\n\n\"If you ask Barca, they would tell you everyone is playing their part and they think they can get one, if not both, of the players. But that is their impression, which right now is not backed up by any evidence.\n\n\"The confusion is Pep Segura uses the words Coutinho and Dembele, and uses the word 'close', which if you shorten the sentence, there you have a story taken out of context.\n\n\"He was trying to say they are doing what they can to get these two players, not necessarily that they are close to confirming.\"\n\nGuillem's Twitter Q&A is back on Friday lunchtime on SkySports.com... get your questions into him by using the #AskGuillem hashtag.\n\nAlso See: Segura: Coutinho close to Barca deal 'Everyone wants Coutinho to stay' Transfer Centre Liverpool news", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T12:07:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 694, "textStart": 679, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "12:07:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "110319", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "163729", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 4}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "306405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 3}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 2}, {"id": "311570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "score": 4}, {"id": "313349", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "score": 4}, {"id": "314152", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "score": 3}, {"id": "352078", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "score": 2}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 5}, {"id": "532843", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guillem Balagu\u00e9"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillem_Balagu\u00e9", "score": 5}], "image": "http://e1.365dm.com/17/08/150x150/skysports-philippe-coutinho-liverpool-premier-league-football_4074099.jpg", "timeCrawl": "12:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Philippe Coutinho deal to Barcelona not as close as many people think, says Guillem Balague", "originalArticle": null}

Pep Segura, Barcelona's manager of sport for football, claimed in midweek that deals for Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund striker Ousmane Dembele \"are very close\", a claim that caused bewilderment at Anfield as they have not entered into negotiations over a transfer.\n\nCoutinho signed a new five-year contract at Liverpool only last season that contains no release clause. He has missed the start of the Premier League and Champions League season for J\u00fcrgen Klopp's side due to a back injury and will again be absent when Crystal Palace visit Anfield on Saturday.\n\nGet (free) transfer notifications for all the clubs in the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "14:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "302606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "score": 2}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 2}, {"id": "306194", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "score": 1}, {"id": "307959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "score": 3}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 2}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 1}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "444487", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "score": 3}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b64c6512079914a1027e129327b2c7dd80554b7/0_90_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=79959f1330c678e34192e06fd394b3c5", "timeCrawl": "15:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Liverpool reject \u00a3114m Barcelona offer for Philippe Coutinho", "originalArticle": null}

The opinion that Liverpool should \"cash in\" on the 25-year-old, who has missed the start of the season through a convenient back injury, and seek to replace him suggests those advocating it, including ex-players, must have been sleepwalking through the window thus far.\n\nThe Reds have yet to tick off two priorities identified before the close of last season: an aerially dominant centre-back, confident on the ball and composed in big spaces, plus a dynamo in the centre of the park.\n\nTheir willingness to make Virgil van Dijk the most expensive defender in the world was met with a tapping-up allegation from Southampton in June, leading to the club making a public apology and 'ending all interest' in the 26-year-old.\n\nSaints maintain they will not sanction a sale for the Netherlands international, despite his agitation for an exit, a position yet to be tested by a blockbuster bid. RB Leipzig, meanwhile, turned down two lucrative approaches from Liverpool for midfielder Naby Keita - the second of which equalled the Bundesliga record for a transfer - with the same line the English side have served Barca: no deal no matter the price.\n\nHaving already encountered obstinate clubs, and with the knowledge that in this warped climate money doesn't necessarily get you what you want when you want it, why should the Reds cede their star performer to a team they ultimately want to compete with just to get more of it?\n\nWho can they realistically buy, at this stage of the summer, that is of equal or superior quality to Coutinho?\n\nAnd in a maddening market, for how much?\n\nWith time depreciating, cracking the transfer conundrums they already have is proving taxing enough for Liverpool without chucking 'Replace Best Player' into the equation.\n\nThe club have curated a front three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah to profit from Coutinho's cerebral, defence-dissecting service.\n\nThe idea was to have one the most explosive, varied forward lines in Europe being supplied by one of the game's premier playmakers. You cannot have fireworks if there's nobody to light the fuse and without 'The Magician', especially given Adam Lallana's absence through a thigh injury for a minimum of two months, Liverpool do not have experienced, creative architects in their squad.\n\nThey need to be sourcing more quality in that department, not waving bye bye to their world-class element of it.\n\nThere are, of course, understandable concerns over how the Coutinho saga is affecting the dressing room as well as the backroom staff.\n\nKlopp has been visibly frustrated by the endless questions over the Brazilian's future, and given the German's emphasis on the collective, he'll be vexed that the talk around Liverpool centres around an individual who doesn't even want to be there.\n\nTrust, commitment and respect are all crucial to the 50-year-old, and he will feel betrayed on all three accounts in this situation.\n\nCoutinho's actions will be all the more perplexing to the manager considering the discussions the pair had at the tail end of last year, while the player was nursing ankle ligament damage.\n\nKlopp sketched a high-definition picture to his prized asset of the shifting landscape in European football, where superpowers like Barca - ironically - were starting to weaken and Liverpool, given their trajectory and vision, could restore themselves amongst the continent's elite.\n\nIn the meetings, it was also explained to Coutinho that he would be the on-pitch instigator of this progress, and as they moved forward together, the adulation he'd receive from the Kop would be ceaseless.\n\nThe Rio-born talent was convinced enough to sign a new five-year deal in January without a release clause, and his camp arranged an interview with the Daily Mail shortly afterwards - not in conjunction with Liverpool - in which he said: \"My heart is here. I do not think about any other club. Not at all.\"\n\nHe echoed those thoughts in May, and upon returning to Melwood for pre-season training on July 11, described his happiness at being back at the club and his ambitions for the season with Liverpool.\n\nEverything that has happened since, ignited by Neymar's world-record switch from Camp Nou to Paris Saint-Germain, has turned the market on its head and turned Coutinho's head.\n\nWith Barca unable to get Liverpool to negotiate, the onus has fallen on the Reds' two-time Player of the Season to force them to soften their position as is the case with Ousmane Dembele at Borussia Dortmund.\n\nIf he opts for the extreme route, Coutinho would do well to revisit the Suarez saga of 2013 when the Uruguayan admitted he took steps while \"desperate, confused and feeling stuck\" that he quickly came to regret.\n\nReintegrating the striker wasn't an issue for former manager Brendan Rodgers, despite them not speaking properly for just over two months. There was relief in the dressing room that he was staying and there was no doubt the forward would continue to perform to devastating effect.\n\nIt would be the same for Coutinho, especially with a World Cup next year, and it should be remembered that bar four players in the senior squad - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jon Flanagan, Ben Woodburn and Ryan Kent - everyone else has moved to Liverpool to further their careers.\n\nThey will understand his ambition and that it has been, as per captain Jordan Henderson's assessment \"a difficult period\" for him.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSo se queda!

Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday night, are looking to bolster their squad following the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nBarcelona have identified Liverpool midfielder Coutinho and Dortmund forward Dembele as their primary targets and look set to spend all of the \u20ac222million they received from Neymar's sale on new acquisitions.\n\nDortmund are understood to have accepted a bid for Dembele, 20, which could rise to as much as \u20ac130million (\u00a3118million) with add-ons.\n\nLiverpool are determined to hold on to Coutinho, who signed a new five-year contract just last season, but Barcelona feel a bid of around \u00a3120million might be enough.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday night, Barcelona's sporting director Pep Segura admitted the club was in conversations with both players and added he was optimistic they would be playing at the Nou Camp this season.\n\n\"We are close to Coutinho and Dembele, we are discussing their conditions but we do not know when they will be sealed,\" Segura told Spanish television station TV3. \"We hope they will be Barcelona players this season.\"\n\nBarcelona fans will indeed be hoping they can add to their squad after they were comprehensively outplayed in the Super Cup by rivals Real.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nMarco Asensio, who also struck a

The paper also suggests that the \u00a380m is not being offered as a lump sum, but over five years.\n\nIs that truly enough to convince Liverpool they have to sell? Consider, as a point of comparison, that Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk has been tipped as a \u00a360m target. Why would Liverpool sell their talisman for marginally more than a centre-back with 18 months Premier League experience, for a fee where over \u00a330m of the windfall might never appear?\n\nDespite netting \u00a3200m for Neymar, Barcelona have a monumental wage bill - including upgraded terms waiting for Lionel Messi to agree to - and looming Camp Nou renovation to fund, making up-front transfer payments for Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele extremely tough to pull off.\n\nA solution could come, ironically, via Paris Saint-Germain. Mundo Deportivo in Spain have reported that Julian Draxler, who has been reportedly told by Unai Emery he is surplus to requirements at Parc de Princess, has been shopped around to the La Liga club.\n\nThe flurry of Barca bids is a massive test of Liverpool's resolve, and their desire to stand their ground and defy football's transfer pecking order.\n\nBBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty declared that the club's \"instant dismissal\" of the latest bid is \"further hard evidence of the determination within the club that they will not be forced into selling their prized asset under any circumstances\".\n\nBut The Telegraph add that Barcelona will not relent; Coutinho feels he has been a good servant and wants to cash in on the \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity, while Barcelona will need to consider upping, or re-structuring, their current bid.\n\nIndeed, Spanish football expert Guillem Balague says that despite the bravado of Barcelona's General Manager Josep Segura saying the deal was 'close', that is far from reality and just a front.\n\n\"Reading between the lines, he is trying to say - and I have spoken to all the relevant sources - that Barca want both players and they are in talks with their representatives. Not more than that. Even though if you take a sentence from it out of context it sounds different,\" he said on TV3.\n\n\"It means they still need to do deals with the clubs and that will not be easy, in fact, it is far from being a close deal if you analyse the situation right now.\n\n\"Borussia has said that Barcelona have not got any close to their price tag for Dembele, \u20ac150m (\u00a3136m), and there is no price for Coutinho. That's where the situation is at the moment.\n\n\"Liverpool insist they will not sell and they have no intention of meeting Barca right now, despite all the false stories about meetings between clubs coming from the Catalan press, which the club have no influence about.\"\n\nHe concludes: \"If you ask Barca, they would tell you everyone is playing their part and they think they can get one, if not both, of the players. But that is their impression, which right now is not backed up by any evidence.\n\n\"The confusion is Pep Segura uses the words Coutinho and Dembele, and uses the word 'close', which if you shorten the sentence, there you have a story taken out of context.\n\n\"He was trying to say they are doing what they can to get these two players, not necessarily that they are close to confirming.\"\n\nThere's two weeks for Liverpool to hold out, and former Premier League midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live's Firday Football Social doing so would be \"cutting off your nose to spite your own face\".\n\n\"Coutinho has done brilliantly for Liverpool. Yes, they have helped develop him, but the fact is that now the deal of a lifetime has presented itself - not just for him but for the club.\n\n\"Once the owners started to get involved, though, it became about power. It's one thing it coming from the manger's mouth - there being a feeling that he shouldn't be sold - but now they are in a situation that sets a precedent for future deals.\"\n\nHe said that Coutinho would feel aggrieved having witnessed the Reds yielding to Raheem Sterling and Luis Suarez in recent years.\n\n\"If a player deserves to move on to bigger things, like Barcelona, it should almost be like: 'Thank you for everything, you've done brilliantly, now on your way.'\"\n\nClub legend Phil Thompson told Sky Sports that the club needed to still be preparing contingencies in the background - however, three of his nominations, Sergio Aguero, Dele Alli and a hard bargain with Barca for Luis Suarez, are seemingly fanciful.\n\nThompson told Sky Sports: \"Signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be a start and would be available for the right money with his contract situation at Arsenal, but the club need to be ready to move if they do sell so we're not caught short.\"\n\nThe fallout from Barcelona's situation is being felt across Europe.\n\nIn Germany, Dembele's teammates continue to round on his walkout last week, but teammate Gonzalo Castro added people \"shouldn't forget that he's only 20\".\n\nCastro told Bild: \"He was always there, he played an outstanding season. And all of a sudden, he doesn't show up for training.\n\n\"We were shocked -- it was new to us. I've never experienced anything like this.\n\n\"You can be sure that [if Dembele were to return] we'd tell him quite clearly that you can't act like that and that his behaviour is damaging the team.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I know from my own experience is that I was not able to make every decision on my own when I was 20. But it's also clear that there are contracts and the club stands above everything.\"\n\nFormer Dortmund star Matthias Sammer told Die Welt: \"The club's big strengths -- the family spirit, the togetherness, the club's aura -- are in danger.\n\n\"Those things which make Dortmund strong are damaged. It's incredibly different for the hierarchy.\n\n\"I can't understand anyone who has any sympathy for a player who does not show up for training. That's a no-go.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "23:51:00",

No news from me because no-one told me anything different since we spoke last time about this.\"\n\nLiverpool, in fact, have told Barcelona the matter is dead after rejecting a \u00a390m bid for their midfielder, and made clear no amount of money will buy him in this transfer window.\n\nAnd Klopp also poured scorn on the idea Coutinho will go on strike, by insisting his attitude hasn't changed since picking up a back injured that has sidelined him for the past fortnight.\n\n\"To be honest I have nothing to say about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he has obviously not been in training,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"I asked the medical department how he is doing and there are no complaints so that is how it is.

We will see what happens.\n\n\"A few things can happen on both sides but everything leads in the direction of August 31 and I can imagine it will be a busy day.

Whether it's the reason for Phil Coutinho not being in the squad, or the reason we dropped points against Watford, we must find a solution to this debilitating problem.\n\nI am disappointed that we've begun without an upgraded defence.\n\nMoreno was clearly not in Klopp's plans last term, and yet here he is starting as our first choice left back. That can't be right?\n\nI don't think its simply a matter of personnel either. Even if we manage to get Virgil Van Dijk, our defensive coaching still needs vast improvement.\n\nThe Coutinho saga needs resolution. I hope LFC are currently getting all their transfer target ducks in a row, ready to spend the Barcelona money as soon as the deal is done.\n\nPie in the sky I know, but Spurs don't pay top wages. Their chairman is very financially astute. Deli Alli grew up a Livepool fan.\n\nSay we offered them all the Barca money for Alli, and offered him double his salary, would they both just say no? Remember, we had the money to buy Van Dijk AND Keita even before Barcelona came calling so it wouldn't eliminate our other plans.\n\nCome on Liverpool. AIM BIG!\n\nSimon Donnelly, Freshfield\n\nIt could be the worst transfer window since 2010\n\nTo not improve our defence adequately over the summer is not acceptable in my opinion. It has been well known that a new centre back was required but we have not strengthened enough.\n\nPersonally I think that this transfer window has been one of the most disappointing in recent years.\n\nMo Salah is an excellent signing but aside from that, to get into the Champions League yet still end up in this situation shows incompetence from those in charge.\n\nIan Ayre was always blamed in the past when we couldn't get deals over the line but those in charge now have really underperformed.\n\nThere was genuine excitement amongst the fans at the end of last season but since then not one of the manager's first choice targets - Keita, Van Dyke, Brandt, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sessegnon - have been secured.\n\nOn top of that we risk losing Philippe Coutinho despite the club knowing that he was always likely to leave and that he has courted Barcelona over the past year.\n\nIt is not quite as bad the Roy Hodgson window of the summer of 2010 when we unveiled Paul Konchesky and Christian Poulsen - but it is not far off.\n\nMichael Atherton, Crosby\n\npoll loading Should Liverpool sell or keep Philippe Coutinho this summer? 21000+ VOTES SO FAR SELL KEEP", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T09:44:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "09:44:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "87653", "label": {"eng": "Huyton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huyton", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huyton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 5}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 3}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 1}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "306207", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 5}, {"id": "313860", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "329275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "score": 3}, {"id": "330362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "393640", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nice guy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_guy", "score": 4}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 5}, {"id": "528129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coutinho", "score": 5}, {"id": "573534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer market"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_market", "score": 3}, {"id": "1270198", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ian Ayre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Ayre", "score": 1}], "image": "http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10889772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Liverpool-FC-Training-Session-in-Germany.jpg", "timeCrawl": "09:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Coutinho has shown his true colours - Liverpool should buy Dele Alli", "originalArticle": null}

The Catalan side have offered \u20ac120million (\u00a3110million) up front. The bid has been structured so that Barca will pay a further \u20ac10million (\u00a39million) based on performance-related add-ons and bonuses.\n\nBarca's previous bid, for \u20ac100million (\u00a390million) included an element of \u20ac15million in add-ons.\n\nLiverpool seem to be sticking to their word that Coutinho won't be sold before the transfer window expires at the end of this month. Reds owners Fenway Sports Group announced last week that Coutinho would be going nowhere this summer only for the player to issue a formal transfer request within hours of FSG's announcement.\n\nBarcelona technical director Robert Fernandez insisted on Thursday that talks were taking place between the two clubs. There have been no talks. However, Barca emailed a formal bid earlier on Friday.\n\nThis is Barca's third bid. As well as the offer of \u20ac100million they have also bid \u20ac80million.

Dortmund are reported to be demanding \u20ac150million for a player they paid \u20ac15million for last summer. Barca have offered \u20ac105million including add-ons. Dembele has responded by refusing to turn up for training. He has since been formally suspended by the Bundesliga side.\n\nBarca are desperate to strengthen their squad following Neymar's departure for Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record transfer fee of \u20ac222million (\u00a3198million).

Not in training so far,\" Klopp told reporters on Thursday, adding that he had nothing negative to say about the player's attitude.\n\nBarcelona's sporting manager Pep Segura said on Wednesday that the Spanish club were \"close\" to signing Coutinho, despite Liverpool's manager and owners saying the 25-year-old is not for sale.\n\nKlopp said on Thursday that nothing had changed with their stance.\n\n\"I don't know why other people are saying what they're saying (about Coutinho moving to Barcelona). I don't even know him (Segura). I have never met him,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"We are not silly, we know it is a very difficult situation -- but there's nothing new to say.

But this time this is the situation.\"\n\nLiverpool have had a relatively quiet transfer window compared to many of their rivals, signing defender Andrew Robertson, winger Mohamed Salah and striker Dominic Solanke.\n\nThey have been linked in British media with moves for Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and midfielder Naby Keita from RB Leipzig, but both players' clubs have said they are not for sale at any price.\n\nFans have expressed frustration with Liverpool's failure to invest further in a squad that finished fourth in the Premier League last season, but Klopp said that he was happy with the players he has already.\n\n\"The whole market is difficult,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"If the transfer window had ended yesterday we already have a team I like. The transfer window is a very important time, but it's also important what we do with the actual team.\"\n\nThe manager said striker Daniel Sturridge, who sustained a thigh injury in pre-season, is fit to return for Liverpool's first home game of the season, which could prove a tough encounter.\n\nPalace, who lost their opening match 3-0 at home to promoted Huddersfield, could become the first side to win four straight Premier League matches at Anfield.\n\n\"I am really looking forward to Anfield.

fantastic,\" said Zidane.\n\nOn top of the absent Ronaldo, the Frenchman also had the luxury of leaving Gareth Bale and Isco on the bench as the gulf between Madrid and Barca's strength in depth was again laid bare.\n\n\"I have a spectacular squad,\" added Zidane.\n\n\"When you see how Isco played in Barcelona and then I take him out it is a bit harsh, but the players understand how long the

Yes, they have helped develop him, but the fact is that now the deal of a lifetime has presented itself - not just for him but for the club.\n\n\"Once the owners started to get involved, though, it became about power. It's one thing it coming from the manger's mouth - there being a feeling that he shouldn't be sold - but now they are in a situation that sets a precedent for future deals.\"\n\nBarcelona have moved for 25-year-old Coutinho - who signed from Inter Milan for \u00a38.5m in 2013 - after selling Brazil team-mate Neymar to Paris St-Germain for a world record transfer fee of \u00a3200m.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, have made two acquisitions this summer. Egypt and former Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah arrived from Roma for \u00a334m in June, before the club paid Hull City \u00a310m for Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson last month.\n\n\"The timing is a problem,\" added ex-Tottenham and Newcastle midfielder Jenas, 34.\n\n\"Barca have got themselves into this situation by selling Neymar when they did, and Liverpool have struggled to make the signings they wanted.\n\n\"If Coutinho goes now, they know they will be in an even harder position - because they failed with bids for Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita and there didn't seem to be a 'Plan B'.\n\n\"But what's also weird about this situation, and another reason why Coutinho probably feels hard done by, is that Liverpool have sold star players in the past - like with Luis Suarez and Raheem Sterling.\n\n\"We had something similar with Dimitar Berbatov when he left Spurs for Manchester United in 2008.\n\n\"If a player deserves to move on to bigger things, like Barcelona, it should almost be like: 'Thank you for everything, you've done brilliantly, now on your way.'\"\n\nBBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty\n\nLiverpool's instant dismissal of Barcelona's third offer is further hard evidence of the determination within the club that they will not be forced into selling their prize asset under any circumstances.\n\nFenway Sports Group, and manager Klopp, remain unmoved by Barcelona's increased financial inducements - as well as a transfer request from a player who has clearly had his head turned.\n\nLiverpool regard this latest bid, understood to be about \u00a3114m, as irrelevant because their stance, as it has been from day one, is that Coutinho will not be sold.\n\nBut questions remain. Will Barcelona take the hint and walk away? Will Coutinho, sidelined by a back injury, accept his dream move will not come to fruition and eventually return to the fold? Will his unhappiness increase at the prospect of a switch to the Nou Camp slipping away?\n\nFor all the noises coming out of Barcelona that a move is \"close\", it remains as far away as the day they made their first approach.

'If he doesn't want to stay then I'd rather see him sold for the best price, but the big issue is that there won't be any players near is quality on the market.'\n\nHe continued: 'What they can do is try to find somebody out there, maybe even play Barcelona at their own game and say you can have Coutinho but we want Luis Suarez.\n\n'Suarez might be unhappy with the Neymar situation. You don't know whether a player is unhappy or a club are willing to sell until you ask the question.\n\nThompson continued: 'They could go after Dele Alli, who was a Liverpool supporter as a kid. Tottenham are a bit like Liverpool in that there's always a price on a player.\n\n'Sergio Aguero is another player that might be interested if he's not happy at Manchester City, but it comes back to being late in the window and that is the difficult situation Liverpool find themselves in.'\n\nIn addition to those unlikely targets, Thompson also picked out Arsenal star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has just 12 months remaining on his contract.

In January, Catalan press ran with the headline 'Operation Coutinho' with Barca deciding the 25-year-old would be the prime off-season target.\n\nIt was said Neymar had singled out Coutinho to be the long term replacement for Andres Iniesta. The pressure was beginning to mount on Liverpool and they responded by tying their man down on a five-year deal, crucially without a release clause.\n\nNow, panicked by losing Neymar, Barcelona have finally come calling and are using their allure to back the player into a corner.\n\n\"The problem here is Barcelona,\" explained Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, a pundit on BT Sport.\n\n\"Because they will be saying to Coutinho's representatives: 'It's now or never. If he doesn't come now, we're never coming back for him ever again.'\n\n\"So they're piling the pressure on and that's why Philippe's reacted.\n\n\"This kid who's come from South America has always had a dream of playing for Barcelona, and he's panicking thinking that if he doesn't do it now it'll never happen again.\"\n\nThis is Barcelona's transfer MO - sound out the player, promise them a dream move and wait for them to become unsettled and force the issue with their club.\n\nDo Liverpool risk holding onto an unhappy player or stand up to Barcelona and Coutinho's play?\n\nWHY LIVERPOOL CAN'T AFFORD TO SELL\n\nFenway Sports Group didn't have to send out the messages they did.\n\nThey didn't have to brief beat writers on the war chest at Klopp's disposal. They didn't have to later state Coutinho would not be sold this summer.\n\nInstead, Liverpool's owners made the club's position clear and public and need to walk the walk to avoid the growing calls of fan unhappiness.\n\nHowever big or small, there is a portion of the Liverpool fan base determined to decry FSG's ownership.\n\nThe promises made, whether real or imagined, this off-season gave the fans hope that Liverpool would keep their stars and strengthen after once again finishing in the top four.\n\nWhen FSG released their brief but firmly worded statement making it clear Coutinho would remain, they nailed that stance in the ground for all to see. It in turn led to the 'Little Magician' instantly submitting a transfer request. To change their tune now would be disastrous for FSG considering they've failed to deliver on spending the money set aside for the Van Dijk and Keita deals.\n\nWILL IT BE TOTALLY DISASTROUS?\n\nPhilippe Coutinho is Liverpool's best player, but that doesn't make him Liverpool's most irreplaceable player.\n\nTo finish last season, the Brazilian dropped into a deeper midfield role in a 4-4-2 diamond and shone. Klopp stated this tweak was a glimpse at what to expect next season. Then he went out and bought Salah.\n\nThat means, alongside Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, Liverpool's first choice front three is set. This forces Coutinho into a midfield role, but importantly a midfield role in a 4-3-3.\n\nWith skipper Jordan Henderson a lock as the deepest midfielder when fit, that leaves just one position to fit one of Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Georgino Wijnaldum. If James Milner truly is back to being a midfielder and not a left back, there's another starting contender who could miss out.\n\nThe worry for Klopp is that in past years, Henderson, Lallana and Coutinho have missed substantial chunks of the season with injuries. Sell Coutinho and lose a few key men to knocks and the squad looks worryingly thin to be able to compete, potentially, on multiple fronts.\n\nHowever, if Coutinho stays -- willingly or not -- it presents Klopp with a delicate balancing act to pick a midfield that provides balance to the XI, and does not leave the side as open defensively, as they have the potential to be.\n\nWHO REPLACES COUTINHO?\n\nThe desire to bring in Keita looked and sounded great.\n\nA young, supremely talented midfielder, Keita can be both an energetic box-to-box midfielder and, importantly, a creative playmaker.\n\nHe was proposed, by some on Merseyside, as Coutinho's replacement 12 months in advance. Keita also has buyout clause of \u00a348m that kicks in next year. Liverpool thought, by offering well over that mark, RB Leipzig would want to cash in.\n\nInstead, they've been rebuffed at every turn and to lose Coutinho AND Coutinho's replacement would highlight Liverpool's failings this window.\n\nAnother name mooted has been Christian Pulisic, who reportedly has his heart set on moving to Real Madrid or Barcelona and not to Liverpool. Pulisic is also not the finished product, risking Liverpool continue to stand still when their rivals are growing.\n\nOriginally published as Barca's dirty trick, Reds puzzle teeters on brink",

Not in training so far,\" Klopp told reporters on Thursday, adding that he had nothing negative to say about the player's attitude.\n\nBarcelona's sporting manager Pep Segura said on Wednesday that the Spanish club were \"close\" to signing Coutinho, despite Liverpool's manager and owners saying the 25-year-old is not for sale.\n\nKlopp said on Thursday that nothing had changed with their stance.\n\n\"I don't know why other people are saying what they're saying (about Coutinho moving to Barcelona). I don't even know him (Segura). I have never met him,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"We are not silly, we know it is a very difficult situation - but there's nothing new to say. It's not always easy for me to say the 100 percent truth... But this time this is the situation.\"\n\nLiverpool have had a relatively quiet transfer window compared to many of their rivals, signing defender Andrew Robertson, winger Mohamed Salah and striker Dominic Solanke.\n\nThey have been linked in British media with moves for Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and midfielder Naby Keita from RB Leipzig, but both players' clubs have said they are not for sale at any price.\n\nFans have expressed frustration with Liverpool's failure to invest further in a squad that finished fourth in the Premier League last season, but Klopp said that he was happy with the players he has already.\n\n\"The whole market is difficult,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"If the transfer window had ended yesterday we already have a team I like. The transfer window is a very important time, but it's also important what we do with the actual team.\"\n\nThe manager said striker Daniel Sturridge, who sustained a thigh injury in pre-season, is fit to return for Liverpool's first home game of the season, which could prove a tough encounter.\n\nPalace, who lost their opening match 3-0 at home to promoted Huddersfield, could become the first side to win four straight Premier League matches at Anfield.\n\n\"I am really looking forward to Anfield. It's our place. It's been a long time since we played there,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"We know it is a tough game.

Liverpool are said to remain unwavering in their stance that he is not for sale at any price.\n\n\"I can't say anything about his attitude because since he has had a back problem he hasn't been in training,\" Klopp added. \"But when I asked the medical department about him they said nothing bad. We are all not silly. It's a difficult situation but there's nothing new to say. I don't like to lie and it's exactly how I say it. Nothing else.\"\n\nWhile Coutinho will not play against Palace, Klopp believes that Daniel Sturridge is ready to feature. The injury-plagued England striker earned praise from both teammates and his manager for some commendable performances during pre-season, only to sustain a thigh problem while scoring during a 3-0 Audi Cup victory over Bayern Munich.\n\n\"Daniel yes, I would say,\" Klopp responded when asked if Sturridge was in line to return. \"Yesterday he was part of the complete session and looked really good, but always after injuries you have to wait to see how the player reacts to this intensity.\"\n\nAdam Lallana remains sidelined for Liverpool due to a thigh strain, while Klopp also confirmed that there has been \"no change\" with regard to Nathaniel Clyne's recovery from a back issue. The latter's future place in the starting XI looks far from guaranteed, with academy graduate Trent Alexander-Arnold continuing to impress in midweek with a brilliant free-kick goal against Hoffenheim.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:02:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 265, "textStart": 256, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "14:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113087", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "303465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "score": 2}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "306194", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "307312", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "score": 2}, {"id": "310557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "TSG 1899 Hoffenheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSG_1899_Hoffenheim", "score": 3}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 3}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 3}, {"id": "311570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 5}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 4}, {"id": "320415", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012\u201313_UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "330362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "331554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "score": 4}, {"id": "348269", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "score": 3}, {"id": "352078", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "score": 2}, {"id": "362476", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "score": 4}, {"id": "366356", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Melwood"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melwood", "score": 3}, {"id": "393663", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adam Lallana"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lallana", "score": 1}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 4}, {"id": "456445", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Frank de Boer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_de_Boer", "score": 3}, {"id": "883065", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Audi Cup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Cup", "score": 2}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1631491/philippe-coutinho.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Philippe Coutinho remains out for Liverpool but Jurgen Klopp insists 'nothing new' on Barcelona link", "originalArticle": null}

They don't have to sell.\n\n'But Coutinho has to want to leave - of course he does. It's very easy to point the fingers at footballers but, no matter what your job is, if you had the chance to go to the best in the business, getting paid way more than you are, then you're going to want to take that offer up.\n\n'In fact, I'd be concerned if Coutinho didn't want to take up Barcelona's offer.\n\nRegardless of the uncertainty surrounding Coutinho's future, Liverpool are actively chasing targets as they look to secure their place in the Champions League group stages following a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim in their play-off first leg.\n\nEarlier this week, Barcelona general manager Pep Segura said a deal for Coutinho, who Liverpool's owners have said will not be leaving the club in this window, was 'close' but Reds boss Jurgen Klopp believes that is not the case.\n\nBellamy returned to the Reds in 2011 where he played for another season under Kenny Dalglish\n\nJurgen Klopp has missed out on a couple of his summer transfer targets and could lose a star\n\nThe German has remained his charismatic self throughout the transfer saga, but Bellamy believes the 50-year-old's patience will begin to wear thin if a resolution is not found soon, with the season now in full swing.\n\nBellamy added: 'I like watching Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp. I enjoy the way they attack, especially on the counter - they're one of the best at it, the pace they break with is immense.\n\n'My concern is when they're attacking in the final third Liverpool seem very venerable to the counter themselves. That's been their biggest weakness with Klopp at the helm and it still hasn't been addressed yet.\n\n'He has tried to sign players to shore the defence up, but he hasn't been able to get those players over the line.\n\n'Klopp will be more frustrated than anyone, because they're what the club needs. But, to me, it looks like unless he gets the player he wants, which looks unlikely, then he's not going to move in the market.'\n\nKlopp needs to address his side's weakness on the counter-attack according to Bellamy\n\nLiverpool have 13 days to hold onto their star for the first half of the Premier League season\n\nCraig Bellamy was speaking exclusively to Paddy Power News.

For wanting to move onto bigger things?\n\n\"That person is ambitious, that person wants to do stuff, that person wants to move on with his life. In a normal job, if there was a chance for you to get promoted, are you going to go: no, no, no - I want to stay in the exact same spot I'm in now.\n\n\"Or, are you going to strive and move forward and be better?\n\n\"There are ways and means of doing it. But if that opportunity is there and you've done what you needed to do and have been the perfect servant to the club, and the club tells you 'no, stay there.' There's only one option for you.\n\n\"Say in Coutinho's spot, he handed in a transfer request. He did every single thing he possibly could do. He stayed, he trained, he worked hard - he stayed away from it - and Liverpool say 'no we're keeping him.'\n\n\"And then he handed in a transfer request because he had no other option. But he's been the perfect servant for them for the past three or four years.\n\n\"His opportunity has arisen to take that massive step and the club are going to keep you where you are.

a referee after being sent off in the first leg was upheld on appeal before kick-off, Madrid were dominant in the first-half.\n\nMarco Asensio's brilliant strike after just four minutes built on Madrid's 3-1 first leg lead and Karim Benzema doubled the hosts' lead on the night just before half-time.\n\nVictory also sealed Madrid's seventh trophy of a spectacularly successful spell since Zinedine Zidane took charge just 20 months ago.\n\n\"We are delighted with how we played in both games, it is another trophy and you have to congratulate the players because they have been fantastic,\" said Zidane.\n\nOn top of the absent Ronaldo, the Frenchman also had the luxury of leaving Gareth Bale and Isco on the bench as the gulf between Madrid and Barca's strength in depth was again laid bare.\n\n\"I have a spectacular squad,\" added Zidane.\n\n\"When you see how Isco played in Barcelona and then I take him out it is a bit harsh, but the players understand how long the season will be and we will need everyone.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T10:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1265, "textStart": 1256, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-31", "amb": false}], "sim":

Currently, they are a team in decline, but Klopp is buoyant about his own club's prospects having led the Reds to the brink of qualification to the group stage of the Champions League.\n\nHe said: \"Can you imagine for a minute I am not a little bit interested about the problems or not of Barcelona?\n\n\"I will never talk about something I spoke about with a player. But you can imagine, in general, I think for each player Liverpool is a very good club, a very good team in the moment.\n\n\"We have a good age of the group. We have very young boys, experience - it's a good mix and we are on our way.\n\n\"I think we got rid of the expectations of 20 years ago and created our own expectations for all the people. They expect a lot from us because of what we did last season.\n\n\"I am fine with the situation and I am very positive about the project of Liverpool. I don't see a lot of reasons for each player to leave the club at the moment and that's just in general.\"\n\nCoutinho remains sidelined by a back problem and won't feature against Crystal Palace at Anfield on Saturday.\n\nKlopp admits the 25-year-old has been missed during the opening week of the season. The manager shifted Coutinho into an advanced central midfield role towards the end of last term so he could pull the strings to a greater degree.\n\nWith Coutinho and Adam Lallana (thigh) both ruled out, Klopp's midfield options have been reduced and it's an area where Liverpool have lacked dynamism during the games against Watford and Hoffenheim.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\n\"Having Phil not available was never cool for us but it happened,\" Klopp added.\n\n\"In my first year he had the hamstring (injury). We always need to adapt. That's how it is. Obviously you see it as good as it is until it's s*** because it doesn't work.\n\n\"And the reason why it doesn't work is not too important, it's just to find a solution. That's what we did in the moment.\n\n\"Every team in the world would miss a creative player in whichever position of his quality. That's not too cool but I am already used to it. You cannot find exactly the same solution. That's how football works.\n\n\"If Phil could have had just one genius idea on the pitch that would have helped. Absolutely. That's all. But I can't work in my office, make a a line-up and say: 'Ahhh! And here we miss Phil'. That's not how it works.\n\n\"It's a situation in the moment and we have to take it like this. In Hoffenheim with the way they play I would have loved to have involved Adam Lallana. It's not always perfect timing and he would have changed the situation for us.

Not as a team or as a club,\" said Pique.\n\n\"We have to stick together and move forward.\n\n\"The season is long and it has just begun. Madrid were superior so we have to live with defeat, congratulate them and improve.\"\n\nNo Ronaldo, no problem\n\nDespite missing the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, whose five-game ban for pushing a referee after being sent off in the first leg was upheld on appeal before kick-off, Madrid were dominant in the first-half.\n\nMarco Asensio's brilliant strike after just four minutes built on Madrid's 3-1 first leg lead and Karim Benzema doubled the hosts' lead on the night just before half-time.\n\nVictory also sealed Madrid's seventh trophy of a spectacularly successful spell since Zinedine Zidane took charge just 20 months ago.\n\n\"We are delighted with how we played in both games, it is another trophy and you have to congratulate the players because they have been fantastic,\" said Zidane.\n\nOn top of the absent Ronaldo, the Frenchman also had the luxury of leaving Gareth Bale and Isco on the bench as the gulf between Madrid and Barca's strength in depth was again laid bare.\n\n\"I have a spectacular squad,\" added Zidane.\n\n\"When you see how Isco played in Barcelona and then I take him out it is a bit harsh, but the players understand how long the

The English club are pitted against Hoffenheim and managed a 2-1 victory over the Bundesliga outfit in Germany on 15 August.\n\nAvoiding defeat in the return leg at Anfield assures Liverpool a place in the group stages of Europe's elite club competition. Coutinho has already expressed his desire to leave his current employers as Barcelona remain keen on securing his services.\n\nThe Brazil international has handed in a transfer request to force a move to the Catalan club. The Reds are adamant that Coutinho will not be allowed to leave in the summer transfer window. Thompson says the ex-Inter Milan man will have a \"very good\" excuse to leave Liverpool if Jurgen Klopp's side fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n\"I think the outcome of the play-off could have a knock-on to Coutinho; if things go pear-shaped then has a pretty good excuse to say, 'Let me go, I want to play in the Champions League', so it is even more important in that respect,\" Thompson told Sky Sports.\n\n\"If we get through to the group stages then I think the owners - because they put everything at Coutinho's disposal before, giving him a five-year deal and the pay increase that he and his agent asked for - have strong enough grounds to stand firm.\n\n\"The owners know it's Barcelona but to them it's a contract signed and until they've got a player who can fill his boots then they have no interest in selling, especially after the way the club was embarrassed with the timing of the transfer request.\"\n\nLiverpool's failure to overcome Hoffenheim could see the Premier League side drop to the Europa League. The Reds could struggle to retain Coutinho if they fail to make it to the group stages of the Champions League and Barcelona will be hoping that the German club can knock Klopp's side out of the competition as that could boost their chances of signing the 25-year-old.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T06:28:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 486, "textStart": 477, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "06:28:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "86084", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "163729", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302789", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "303027", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "score": 1}, {"id": "303048", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "303119", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "score": 3}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 4}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 1}, {"id": "307959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "score": 3}, {"id": "310557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "TSG 1899 Hoffenheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSG_1899_Hoffenheim", "score": 3}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 1}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 2}, {"id": "313349", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "score": 2}, {"id": "315885", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "score": 3}, {"id": "347985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Phil Thompson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Thompson", "score": 4}, {"id": "375920", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006\u201307_UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 4}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "446896", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pear-shaped"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear-shaped", "score": 2}, {"id": "1427299", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "2006\u201307 Superleague Greece"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006\u201307_Superleague_Greece", "score": 3}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1631363/philippe-coutinho.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:28:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Liverpool's chances of keeping Philippe Coutinho depend on Champions League qualification says Phil Thompson", "originalArticle": null}

again laid bare.\n\n\"I have a spectacular squad,\" added Zidane.\n\n\"When you see how Isco played in Barcelona and then I take him out it is a bit harsh, but the players understand how long the

The Brazil international missed Liverpool's opening game of the Premier League season against Watford on Saturday and also did not travel for Tuesday's Champions League qualifier against Hoffenheim.\n\nESPN's Spanish channel ESPN Deportes reports that any deal for the midfielder will also be worth more than \u20ac100m (\u00a391m), including various performance-based bonuses. The Reds have struggled to cope without their star player thus far, managing only a draw against Watford but were able to get the better of Hoffenheim in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier in a close game, where the Bundesliga club missed a penalty. However, Can insists that there will be no bad blood among the players if he does decide to leave as it is up to the player.\n\n\"I think it's no problem for us because nobody speaks in the team about that,\" Can told reporters on the Coutinho situation, as quoted by Goal. \"Of course, if Philippe stays with us everybody is happy - in my eyes, he's one of the best players in the world. But if he goes, if he wants to go then everyone will wish him the best and we have to go again.\"\n\nEager to make a mark after Neymar's \u00a3198m to Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona are hopeful of signing both Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund winger Ousmane Dembele before the transfer window closes.

and can afford him still - next summer, or the one after that?\n\nAlmost certainly not.\n\nCome next summer, the Catalan giants may have moved on and his dream move would remain just that: a dream.\n\nCoutinho's rapid descent from being content with life at Liverpool, to the utter madness that has since transpired is a lesson in the cutthroat nature of football at the highest level.\n\nWhile the Reds of Merseyside rue the Brazilian's actions, criticising his handling of the whole situation, was there any other way to force this deal through?\n\nAfter Klopp and FSG insisted time and time again that Liverpool were not a selling club and that they wouldn't listen to any offers, Coutinho really only had one more trick up his sleeve, and he played it.\n\nAnd he's not the first, nor will he be the last player to do so.\n\nWhile no one forced Coutinho to sign his extension at the start of the year, contracts work as more of a price influencer nowadays than a full-proof obstacle to a transfer.\n\nBut, when clubs throw logic out the window and refuse to so much as discuss a transfer, desperate players are left with only one option.\n\nOne doesn't need to look further than the Liverpool fans encouraging and applauding Virgil van Dijk's fight for his Southampton exit.\n\nOr Barcelona's second summer target Ousmane Dembele's mysterious disappearing act.\n\nThere is a tangible frustration among Reds fans as they watch Coutinho succeed in forcing his way out, in a way that Keita and van Dijk were seemingly unable to.\n\nAnd while Coutinho's departure may sting, a proposed \u00a3120m deal - although the composition and timing of it is now being questioned - is a massively inflated fee for a player that has, some would argue, had one season of consistent, elite production.\n\nFor all of Liverpool's fighting talk, just how rational is it to turn down an offer that almost doubles the fee they received for Suarez?", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "23:51:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "86084", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 5}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 3}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 3}, {"id": "308253", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "score": 2}, {"id": "311377", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "score": 1}, {"id": "311570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "score": 2}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "313862", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "score": 3}, {"id": "326493", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "score": 3}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "342435", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "score": 3}, {"id": "393663", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adam Lallana"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lallana", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 4}, {"id": "460422", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "score": 3}, {"id": "1288974", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naby Ke\u00efta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naby_Ke\u00efta", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84339524dccdd2051d81549739bbd4fb", "timeCrawl": "23:51:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Why Reds are now lose-lose in Coutinho saga", "originalArticle": null}

Site regular Case has requested another poll to gauge the prevailing view amongst Reds fans, so here it is:\n\nIn my view, Liverpool should just sell Coutinho ASAP for as much money as possible. He is no longer the future of LFC, so there's no point keeping him. Plus, for all ability, Coutinho's goals/assists record has never been that impressive:\n\n* Goals: Personal best = 14 in one season. Average: 9 per season (all competitions)\n\n* Assists: Personal best = 9 in one season. Average: 8 per season (all competitions)\n\nAre we seriously to believe that Liverpool is incapable of replacing an attacking player who contributes a meager 8 assists every season in ALL competitions? Coutinho's primary role is to create and score goals, but his goals/assist return is merely average. Plus, n terms of minutes-per-goal/assist, Coutinho is near the bottom of the pile in a 4-year comparative analysis of players who operate in similar positions (as I've illustrated with detailed stats in the past)\n\nCoutinho may well improve his output at Barcelona, but where Liverpool are concerned, Coutinho is replaceable. If the Reds can bring in a player who consistently contributes 20-25 goals/assists every season, then personally, I'll be happy with that, even if said player isn't as talented as Coutinho.\n\nThat said, scoring is not Liverpool's problem. Even without Coutinho this season, the club has players who can (and will) score the requisite number of goals. Salah, for example, will (in all probability) pick up the Coutinho slack, which means Liverpool will lose very little overall in the goals/assists department.\n\nWe're not talking about a player who consistently has a Luis Suarez-type impact on the team (!). Coutinho's end product is average, yet despite that, he is currently at the apex of his transfer value.

Probably both teams not overly happy (with their first games).\" (Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis)", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.501960813999176, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "14:53:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "87713", "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "304436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305679", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "score": 3}, {"id": "307959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "score": 3}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 2}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 5}, {"id": "330362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "362476", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "score": 2}, {"id": "544988", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f4nio Wilson Vieira Hon\u00f3rio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f4nio_Wilson_Vieira_Hon\u00f3rio", "score": 5}, {"id": "573534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer market"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_market", "score": 4}], "image": "http://img.etimg.com/photo/6325547.cms", "timeCrawl": "14:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Soccer-Liverpool's Coutinho still injured, no attitude problem, says Klopp", "originalArticle": null}

{"id": "9967065", "categories": [], "date": "2017-08-18", "uri": "711632605", "source": {"id": "886", "title": "ProSoccerTalk", "uri": "soccer.nbcsports.com"}, "url": "http://soccer.nbcsports.com/2017/08/18/liverpool-holds-all-the-cards-in-coutinho-saga/", "body": "In a time of heightening player control in a rapidly expanding transfer market, one club sticks out as grasping a clear understanding of the shifting business landscape and how to retain its grip on its most valuable assets.\n\nFollowing the sudden departure of superstar playmaker Neymar, Barcelona is trying desperately to pry Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool. On Friday, numerous reports in England claimed that Barcelona had gone in with a third bid, one even more ridiculous than the previous two. But they're fighting a losing battle.\n\nFor a number of reasons, the Reds hold complete control over Philippe Coutinho's transfer saga, a saga that will likely end with no transfer having been completed.\n\nFirst and foremost, Coutinho just recently signed a contract extension in January that runs through 2022. As far as we know, there is no release clause in the deal, meaning at the most basic of levels, Liverpool maintains contractual control. However, as we've seen the past few years, that alone hasn't stopped a number of players forcing their way out.\n\nYet this time, Liverpool finds itself in an advantageous position outside of just the contract. With the 2018 World Cup right around the corner, the Reds know that should they force Coutinho to stay, he is obligated to play at his best, knowing that any less would see him miss out on a spot in the packed Brazil roster, or at the least a starting position. Thus, Liverpool can be sure that even if their denial of his departure renders him despondent, he will likely remain the quality player he has proven to be.\n\nThe money Barcelona is offering - a whopping $151 million according to the most recent reports - is indeed a ludicrous amount for a player who, while quality, does not have nearly the marketability of his countrymate now residing in Paris. On talent alone, Coutinho likely isn't worth that total, meaning Liverpool should sell. And yet, even with that cash in hand, in this hyper-inflated market where more is less, could it really do justice in replacing his impact in the club? This late in the transfer window, there's no chance they could replace the 25-year-old, meaning they'd likely be torpedoing their entire season - Champions League included - to feel the warmth of $151 million burning a hole in their pocket until January, or even next summer.\n\nLiverpool has built its entire roster around Coutinho. The arrival of Salah, the use of Firmino, the wide deployment of Mane, the makeup of the midfield. He's good enough and young enough to be considered a \"franchise player.\" In two games without Coutinho this season, they've scored five goals, but that is a poor metric to describe the 180 wild minutes. The money alone isn't worth the cost of his departure.\n\nIt's quite possible that Barcelona's stubbornness, brought on by the sudden loss of a beloved player and the meteoric rise of their rivals to all-time greatness, could see the Catalans come back with an even more preposterous bid.

He was continually caught out of position and was making attacking runs at the wrong times. He is simply, defensively a liability and I hope to see the return of Milner against Palace.\n\nLast January we saw the pictures of a beaming Philippe Coutinho after signing a new five-year deal worth a reputed \u00a3150,000 a week with the Reds, taking him up to the summer of 2022.\n\nHe was quoted as saying he was \"delighted\" to sign a new contract, \"he loves the fans, the club and the City of Liverpool\" and \"Jurgen Klopp is a winner\" and he was looking forward to the future with LFC.\n\nFast forward just eight months later to today, and we see a moody Coutinho, wanting to leave LFC after putting in a transfer request.\n\nThere are rumours coming from his camp that he does not see eye to eye with the manager and that LFC always make it difficult for players to leave.\n\nCoutinho states he has a \"back injury\" but how often in the past have we witnessed these prima donna footballers, who really do live in a different world than the man in the street, feign injury or state they are not in the \"right frame of mind\" to play, in order to gain the mega bucks move that they crave.\n\nNow I am not saying for definite here that Coutinho is feigning injury, but it does seem a strange coincidence that he has a \"bad back\" at this time when he and his agent are chasing a move to Barcelona.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nA player all LFC fans thought loved the club and was a \"nice guy\" has shown his true colours and true character - and it ain't a pretty sight.\n\nIf the club go ahead and sell Coutinho against the wishes of Klopp it would surely break the trust between the boardroom & the manager and surely when that happens there is only one outcome.\n\nI expect Liverpool Football to adhere to the wishes of Jurgen Klopp and refuse point blank to bow to Barcelona, Coutinho and his agent's demands.\n\nWouldn't be it be nice, if for the first time a club of the stature of Liverpool FC says \"enough is enough\" and demand that the player fulfills his five year contract he willingly signed just a few months ago.\n\nModern football in 2017 - it stinks.\n\nGraham Agg, Netherton\n\nSelling Coutinho would lead to Reds recruiting two inferior replacements\n\nThe argument from some pundits to sell Phillippe Coutinho and invest in other areas of the side is nonsensical.\n\nThe Brazilian's skill-set of vision and weight of pass to dissect a low block defence is irreplaceable and instantly changes the side's realistic ambitions for the season.\n\nAdd to the fact Coutinho is two players in one, being a number eight and higher left sided forward means Liverpool would have to replace two positions with players of inferior quality.\n\nThe club have been willing to spend upwards of \u00a3140million on the two targets identified as elite level purchases with sellers refusing to do business.\n\nWhy would this change with two weeks of the window to go, alongside the issue of replacing Coutinho's world class talent.\n\nSimply put it wouldn't and Liverpool would be an inferior side.\n\nMark Baker, Huyton\n\nAim big - throw all the Coutinho money on Deli Alli\n\n'A bad back' seems to be the most appropriate phrase for the start of our season. Whether it's the reason for Phil Coutinho not being in the squad, or the reason we dropped points against Watford, we must find a solution to this debilitating problem.\n\nI am disappointed that we've begun without an upgraded defence.\n\nMoreno was clearly not in Klopp's plans last term, and yet here he is starting as our first choice left back. That can't be right?\n\nI don't think its simply a matter of personnel either. Even if we manage to get Virgil Van Dijk, our defensive coaching still needs vast improvement.\n\nThe Coutinho saga needs resolution. I hope LFC are currently getting all their transfer target ducks in a row, ready to spend the Barcelona money as soon as the deal is done.\n\nPie in the sky I know, but Spurs don't pay top wages. Their chairman is very financially astute. Deli Alli grew up a Livepool fan.\n\nSay we offered them all the Barca money for Alli, and offered him double his salary, would they both just say no? Remember, we had the money to buy Van Dijk AND Keita even before Barcelona came calling so it wouldn't eliminate our other plans.\n\nCome on Liverpool. AIM BIG!\n\nFinally, a shout out to young Trent Alexander-Arnold. A great start to the season, and a great contribution on Tuesday night. A huge future awaits.\n\nSimon Donnelly, Freshfield\n\nWe've underperformed in the transfer market in what could be the worst summer since Hodgson in 2010\n\nWhat a great win for the Reds against Hoffenheim following the frustration of throwing two precious points away against Watford on Saturday. We now have one foot in the Champions League and the victory was fully deserved.\n\nWell done to Trent Alexander-Arnold for his fantastic goal and impressive start to the season. In Alexander-Arnold we also have someone who can actually take a decent corner.\n\nAgainst Watford it was a hugely frustrating performance. We made Okaka look like Kaka in the first half and, although he impressed in pre-season, it is a sad state of affairs that Alberto Moreno is first choice left back.\n\nPersonally, I think that the goalkeeper must take the blame too for allowing people to head goals in from inside the six-yard box.\n\nDespite the frustrations, hopefully we will beat Palace at Anfield at the weekend to move up to four points - which would be one point better off than at the same stage last season when we lost to Burnley.\n\nTo not improve our defence adequately over the summer is not acceptable in my opinion. It has been well known that a new centre back was required but we have not strengthened enough.\n\nPersonally I think that this transfer window has been one of the most disappointing in recent years.\n\nMo Salah is an excellent signing but aside from that, to get into the Champions League yet still end up in this situation shows incompetence from those in charge.\n\nIan Ayre was always blamed in the past when we couldn't get deals over the line but those in charge now have really underperformed.\n\nThere was genuine excitement amongst the fans at the end of last season but since then not one of the manager's first choice targets - Keita, Van Dyke, Brandt, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sessegnon - have been secured.\n\nOn top of that we risk losing Philippe Coutinho despite the club knowing that he was always likely to leave and that he has courted Barcelona over the past year.\n\nIt is not quite as bad the Roy Hodgson window of the summer of 2010 when we unveiled Paul Konchesky and Christian Poulsen - but it is not far off.\n\nMichael Atherton, Crosby", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T04:43:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "04:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "86727", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "87653", "label": {"eng": "Huyton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huyton", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huyton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 5}, {"id": "303977", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "score": 1}, {"id": "304606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305842", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chairman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman", "score": 2}, {"id": "306207", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "score": 2}, {"id": "306576", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "score": 4}, {"id": "307311", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick", "score": 4}, {"id": "307959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "score": 1}, {"id": "311380", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "score": 1}, {"id": "311434", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "score": 1}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 4}, {"id": "330362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "379125", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simon Mignolet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Mignolet", "score": 4}, {"id": "393655", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "James Milner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Milner", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}], "image": "http://i2.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article13485721.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Jurytrio.jpg", "timeCrawl": "04:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Fans blame Liverpool transfer situation on Coutinho, Klopp and owners", "originalArticle": null}

You don't know whether a player is unhappy or a club are willing to sell until you ask the question.\"\n\nThe European Cup winning captain thinks Tottenham midfielder Alli would also add another attacking dimension to a Reds side without Coutinho.\n\n\"They could go after Dele Alli, who was a Liverpool supporter as a kid,\" Thompson added. \"Tottenham are a bit like Liverpool in that there's always a price on a player.\"\n\nAguero has plundered 170 goals in six years for Manchester City, and he would give Liverpool an attacking thrust up top, according to Thompson.\n\n\"Sergio Aguero is another player that might be interested if he's not happy at Manchester City,\" he added.\n\n\"But it comes back to being late in the window and that is the difficult situation Liverpool find themselves in.\"\n\nPerhaps the most realistic of the four is Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\nThompson told Sky Sports: \"Signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be a start and would be available for the right money with his contract situation at Arsenal, but the club need to be ready to move if they do sell so we're not caught short.\"\n\nLiverpool are believed to have been monitoring Oxlade-Chamberlain's contract situation at the Emirates this summer, but have yet to firm up their interest with an offer for the versatile England international.\n\nBarcelona have

If he doesn't want to stay then I'd rather see him sold for the best price, but the big issue is that there won't be any players near is quality on the market.\n\n\"It's probably too late in the window to get somebody in, so I think they'll keep him for a season. Coutinho might argue that Barcelona won't be there again but if you believe you're a top player then a top club will always be interested.\n\nThommo predicts...\n\nFind out what Thommo is predicting for Liverpool v Crystal Palace here.\n\n\"I think the owners will hold firm. They've backed themselves into a corner with the statements they've made along with Jurgen Klopp's comments, so I just don't see how they can go back on that, especially when the fans are already quite unhappy with the summer transfer business as deals for Virgil van Dijk and Naby Keita are looking increasingly unlikely.\n\n\"The comments coming out from Barca saying that a deal is close might be a red flag to a bull, making the owners, who are adamant because of the deal they gave him six months ago, even more focused on standing their ground, so I think they will keep him.\"\n\nThommo is hopeful that the club can identify targets, urging them to use the same aggressive tactics which prompted Coutinho to hand in a transfer request on the eve of the season.\n\nHe added: \"What they can do is try to find somebody out there, maybe even play Barcelona at their own game and say you can have Coutinho but we want Luis Suarez.\n\n\"Suarez might be unhappy with the Neymar situation. You don't know whether a player is unhappy or a club are willing to sell until you ask the question.\n\n\"They could go after Dele Alli, who was a Liverpool supporter as a kid. Tottenham are a bit like Liverpool in that there's always a price on a player.\n\n\"Sergio Aguero is another player that might be interested if he's not happy at Manchester City, but it comes back to being late in the window and that is the difficult situation Liverpool find themselves in.\n\n\"Signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be a start and would be available for the right money with his contract situation at Arsenal, but the club need to be ready to move if they do sell so we're not caught short.\"\n\nThommo is concerned that the absence of Adam Lallana, who has been ruled for a number of months with a thigh injury, would make the sale of Coutinho and failure to replace him even more concerning.\n\n\"Lallana isn't going to be back in the team for a few months,\" the Soccer Saturday pundit said. \"He's another one of you more creative players behind the forwards, so you're looking at a less creative Liverpool team without either of them.\"\n\nSuper 6 \u00a31million\n\nWill you be Super 6's first millionaire?

Will Philippe Coutinho get his wish for a move to Barcelona or will Liverpool hold him at Anfield?\n\nHe's got a five-year contract at his current club so they are under no obligation to sell, but with rumours that Barcelona are set to come in with a third bid and Coutinho sitting out of Liverpool's opening games of the campaign, he could still be off. Let's face it, Barcelona usually get their man.\n\nSo if he does leave, who could Liverpool turn to? How do you replace someone like Coutinho?\n\nThe 26 year-old is one of Europe's hottest prospects this summer and has even been the subject of a reported \u00a354 million bid from Barcelona. He netted 18 Serie A goals last season for the club he has played for since coming through their Youth Academy. He was once called the 'Italian Messi' by former Napoli team-mate Goran Pandev and can be utilised anywhere across the front line. He can also hit a free-kick although after Tuesday evening's strike, he would have to battle Trent Alexander-Arnold for that privilege at Anfield. Serie A expert Paolo Baldini does expect the Italian club to hold on to their star man but he is said to be Jurgen Klopp's top target, should Coutinho leave.\n\nThe 21 year-old German international has been a reported target for both Tottenham and Arsenal so far this summer. He has just one year remaining on his Schalke contract and has rejected a new deal, confirming he is open to considering other options. Klopp has apparently been a long-time admirer of his compatriot and some say he even tried to sign the attacking midfielder for Borussia Dortmund. Meyer scored just one Bundesliga goal in 18 starts last season.\n\nThe midfielder has a reported \u00a336.4m release clause in his contract so could prove a cheaper signing for the Anfield club. Reports by TransferMarketWeb suggest he could be moving to Liverpool regardless of Coutinho's future. Seri is an Ivory Coast international who is also reportedly interesting Arsenal, Barcelona and PSG. The 26 year-old midfielder netted seven Ligue 1 goals last season. Stamina and a good passing ability mean he is the man who makes Nice tick in the middle of the park and therefore could also be seen as an alternative signing to Naby Keita for the Reds.\n\nAnother player with just a year to run on his current deal, the Ox could be on his way out of the Emirates. Reports in the Express claim both Liverpool and Manchester United have enquired about his availability with Chelsea also interested. The winger can also play centrally and that versatility would certainly appeal to Jurgen Klopp and his fluid formation. The England international netted just two Premier League goals last season.\n\nPerhaps less likely to move to Liverpool, the Real Madrid star has nonetheless been linked with a move to Anfield this summer. Asensio scored during the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona but is reportedly attracting interest from Arsenal, Manchester City, Juventus and Bayern Munich. The Sun say that Asensio is determined to stay at his current club and will use the interest as leverage over a new contract as he seeks confirmation on his place in Zinedine Zidane's plans.\n\nSo there are a few options for the Reds. No doubt any Liverpool fan would still rather keep hold of their Brazilian playmaker.

Barcelona is not one step closer to signing Dembele,' Watzke told Kicker.\n\n'I can not explain what he is telling me. Maybe it's because Real Madrid played his team dizzy in the Super Cup.\"\n\n'Nothing has advanced, not even by a millimetre.'\n\nThe news will come as a blow to Barcelona and the Catalans will be wary of infuriating Dortmund during negotiations.\n\nBarcelona announced a deal for former Spurs midfielder Paulinho this week but the Brazilian's arrival is hardly likely to satisfy supporters who have watched Real Madrid win three out of the last four Champions League titles.\n\nDembele, for his part, is keen on moving to the Camp Nou but he is just one year into his contract at Dortmund and the

With deadline day now just two weeks away, here are five deals that could still take place.\n\nTired of reading? Click through the mini-gallery above to see five transfers that could still happen, according to the Daily Mirror.\n\nEnglish publication the Daily Mirror believe that Alexis Sanchez could move Manchester City. Citizens boss Pep Guardiola, who worked with the Chilean at FC Barcelona, is said to still be a huge fan of the attacker, who is now in the final year of his contract at Arsenal.\n\nA Philippe Coutinho switch to the Blaugrana is another transfer many are expecting to be wrapped up in the coming weeks. With Neymar having left the Camp Nou, Coutinho would be seen as a much-needed marquee signing, but his Liverpool are adamant they are not interested in selling. The player has put in a transfer request, but Jurgen Klopp and the club's board have rejected it.\n\nWhile Liverpool might be on the verge of losing a player, they may also be close to signing one in the next few days. Southampton's Virgil van Dijk has been linked with the Reds for a few months now, but the Saints are apparently not interested in selling unless they get \u00a370 million (R1.19 billion) for him. The player has also requested to leave the club, and is training on his own at the moment.\n\nBorussia Dortmund starlet Ousmane Dembele is another player who could be on the move soon, according to the English publication. The France international has been linked with FC Barcelona and is expected to team up with Coutinho at the Catalan club. Dortmund are playing hardball with the Spanish giants, though, and are demanding \u20ac150 million (R2.33 billion) for their prized asset.\n\nArsenal Star Linked With Shock Juventus Move?\n\nLastly, Paris Saint-Germain are expected to make one more signing in this window, and the Daily Mirror thinks it could be Kylian Mbappe. The Monaco star has been closely monitored by many of Europe's elite clubs over the past few months, with many expecting Real Madrid to be his next stop, instead of Paris.\n\nWhich of these transfers do you think will happen?

another offer for Philippe Coutinho.\n\nThere is growing anger within Anfield at the games now being played by the Catalan club, and the message from Merseyside is simple: the matter is closed.\n\nMirrorSport has revealed the true financial details behind Barca's latest bid , which was leaked for maximum publicity at headline figures of of just under \u00a3119m.\n\nIn fact, the third attempt to cause unrest and a fraught political situation designed to prise Coutinho from the Premier League constituted only a guaranteed \u00a380m, with the rest in increasingly abstract add-ons.\n\nThose included multiple Champions' League triumphs and the Brazilian winning the Balon D'Or and would be considered largely unachievable by the English outfit.\n\nDespite receiving \u00a3200m in cash from PSG for Neymar in one single payment, Barcelona also want to pay for Coutinho over a period of instalments, with the total term of payments understood to be five years.\n\nThat has led many observers to suspect reports suggesting the Spanish side suffered financial problems before the Neymar deal was completed have substance, and Barcelona don't have the funds to make up front bids for both Coutinho and their other main summer target, Ousmane Dembele of Dortmund.\n\nDortmund have turned down a bid of \u00a390m for their striker, and have insisted they will not do business unless any approach reaches their valuation of around \u00a3140m...which would leave little room for manoeuvre with the Brazil star.\n\nLiverpool have made clear they are not interested at any price, and their official, direct response to the latest bid has been to demand no further contact.\n\nRealistically though, the Anfield board are wearily aware that no matter how firm their stance, Barca are likely to continue their plotting, and return within the next week with another bid, and Coutinho will continue to press them to accept.\n\nThe American owners though, have issued what they described as a \"definitive\" statement saying the player will not be sold at any price, and they will refuse to go back on that word given to the Reds support.\n\nThese 'never-never payments' would include Coutinho...\n\nWinning multiple trophies in the same season Winning multiple Champions League titles Winning the Ballon d'Or as the world's best player Winning multiple

This also applies to Ousmane -- he can't just do whatever he wants.\"\n\n\"Ousmane has done no good by going on strike. He should not forget that he still has a long-term contract at Dortmund,\" he added.\n\nSokratis says he hopes Dembele will return to training soon.\n\nHe remains suspended as Dortmund prepare for their opening game of the new Bundesliga season at Wolfsburg on Saturday.\n\n\"At first he has to get in touch with us again and come to training.

Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nBarcelona are ready to give up on signing Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund winger Ousmane Dembele and move on to their Plan B instead.\n\nJose Mourinho sends stark warning to Man Utd players after equalling 110-year record\n\nThe Catalan club had a third bid worth \u00a3118 million rejected for Coutinho, while BVB are adamant that Dembele will not leave despite going AWOL in an effort to force through the move.\n\nAnd now Sport are reporting that Barca are preparing to raid Ligue 1 with moves for PSG winger Angel Di Maria and Nice midfielder Jean Michael Seri.\n\nThe Argentine, who had a miserable spell at Manchester United before moving to the French capital, is seen as a more like-for-like replacement for Neymar than Dembele.\n\nErnesto Valverde particularly likes his commitment and versatility, while he has a good understanding with star man Lionel Messi from their time together with the Argentina national team.\n\nJean-Michael Seri Ligue 1 statsGames34Assists9Goals7\n\nShare\n\nDi Maria is thought to be keen to leave PSG, with his position in the side potentially in doubt if the big-spending Parisians add rumoured targets Alexis Sanchez and Kylian Mbappe to their ranks.\n\nHowever, the relationship between PSG and Barca has almost completely broken down over the manner in which the French giants prised Neymar away.\n\nSeri, meanwhile, would be a relatively easy deal to complete, with the Ivory Coast midfielder's buyout clause currently set at \u00a332m.\n\nHe has attracted interest from the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham and is well regarded by Barca, even if he is unproven in a major league and not used to the expectation that comes with playing for a club like Barca.\n\nMORE: Liverpool legend Phil Thompson names three outrageous transfer targets if Philippe Coutinho joins Barcelona", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:43:00Z", "extractedDates":

The bid was said initially to have been made up of a guaranteed \u20ac120million (\u00a3110million) with a further \u20ac10million (\u00a39million) in add-ons and bonuses.\n\nHowever, the Daily Mirror claims to have seen details. It claims that only \u00a380million was guaranteed to Liverpool. The paper adds that many of the add-ons would have been difficult to attain. These included winning multiple trophies in the same season, winning multiple Champions League titles, winning the Ballon d'Or and even winning multiple trophies and the Ballon D'Or in the same season. In addition, Barcelona would only have paid the \u00a380million over a five-year period.\n\nIf those claims are true then it would mean that Barcelona have offered only slightly more up front in this bid than they did in their previous of bid totalling \u20ac100million (\u00a390million) earlier this month. On that occasion, Barca bid a guaranteed \u20ac85million (\u00a378million) with a further \u20ac15million in add-ons.\n\nMeanwhile, a source at Barcelona has told the Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo that the La Liga side will \"fight to the end\" to sign Coutinho. The Brazilian is reported to have told Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp that he has no intention of playing for the club again even if it jeopardises his place in Brazil's World Cup squad for next summer.\n\nIt remains to be seen how all this pans out. Barcelona are expected to come back with a fourth bid despite Friday's rebuttal - one with a better set of terms than those that were offered in this latest bid.\n\nCoutinho is desperate to make the move to the Nou Camp even though he will only match the \u00a3200,000 a week he currently earns at Anfield by achieving a good number of add-ons and bonuses. After Barca's performances against Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup this week that looks unlikely.

The club's general manager Pep Segura appeared to add weight to those claims following the club's Spanish Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday, commenting the club were close to deals that could see them pay \u20ac100m (\u00a391m) apiece for the two players.\n\nBoth Liverpool and Dortmund have hit back at those comments, however. Jurgen Klopp insisted at a press conference on Thursday there was \"nothing new\" regarding Coutinho's future at the club, while Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke insisted Barcelona have \"not moved a millimetre closer\" to completing a deal for Dembele.\n\nAnd Fernandez, club secretary at the Nou Camp, appears to have cast more doubt on the deals after admitting the fact neither player has a release clause in their contract is complicating matters.\n\n\"Not just Barcelona but any team looking for top quality players are getting involved in a very difficult situation in this market,\" Fernandez said at the club's unveiling of new midfielder Paulinho, ESPN report.\n\n\"Why? Because the market is where clubs like us want to sign top quality players. There's no buyout clauses, so that makes things trickier. Yes, we are negotiating with clubs to make several signings, but in all awareness of the difficulty.\n\n\"We need to work our way into a favourable situation and hopefully close these deals as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFernandez also confirmed the club are looking to offload a number of players who are not part of Ernesto Valverde's plans this season. Among those is Arda Turan, who was left out of the Barcelona squad for both legs of the Spanish Super Cup with Galatasaray eager to offer him a route back to Turkey.\n\n\"We are working on the possibility of players that could leave,\" Fernandez said. \"The players that didn't have numbers on their shirts is because we haven't resolved their situations entirely. No doubts some players are leaving, but also others will be coming in.\"\n\nFernandez also echoed comments made by Valverde regarding the future of versatile midfielder Sergi Roberto, insisting the summer arrivals of Nelson Semedo and Paulinho have no bearing on his future at the club.\n\n\"We have talked to him and it was a very normal conversation,\" he said, Marca report. \"We want him to do a great job for the team and we want him to do so for many more years.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T18:40:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "18:40:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "225", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "110319", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "305674", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "score": 3}, {"id": "305737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "score": 2}, {"id": "305867", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "score": 2}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 4}, {"id": "311570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 4}, {"id": "313017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "score": 3}, {"id": "314152", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "score": 3}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "336346", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

We must stay as close as possible and keep moving forwards.\"\n\nCoach Ernesto Valverde is still settling in at his new club but appears to have a big task on his hands.\n\n\"When you lose and you have the feeling that the opponent has, in some moments, been better, you have to analyse the technical aspects,\" he said.\n\n\"We wanted to win, but it could not be.\n\n\"We have to recover psychologically. We have to adapt because things have changed.\"\n\nValverde said he did not know if or when Coutinho and Dembele might arrive after the club's general manager Pep Segura said their signings were \"close\".\n\nWhile Barca are experiencing difficulties, European and Spanish champions Madrid march on, with Zidane collecting his seventh trophy since taking charge of the team in January 2016.\n\n\"I'm pleased with how we're doing things, and in particular with how we're playing,\" he said.\n\n\"The first 15 or 20 minutes were spectacular in pressing high up and how we kept hold of the ball. It was a very good first half.\n\n\"In the second half we had to dig in a bit because this opposition can cause you problems, that's to be expected.\n\n\"We wanted to play just as we did and when things go to plan you're happy. The players were fantastic.\n\n\"We're not going to get euphoric, this is a long-run thing and we'll enjoy the moment\".\n\nAlso See: Real clinch Super Cup 'No further talks on Dembele' La Liga: 10 new signings to watch Paulinho completes Barca move", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T06:33:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1747, "textStart": 1735, "date": "2016-01-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.4235294163227081, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370102", "time": "06:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370102", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "149322", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "151106", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302787", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "score": 3}, {"id": "305102", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "score": 3}, {"id": "305674", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "score": 2}, {"id": "306281", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.", "score": 3}, {"id": "306284", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gareth Bale"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Bale", "score": 3}, {"id": "307311", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick", "score": 3}, {"id": "309177", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "310519", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zinedine Zidane"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane", "score": 5}, {"id": "310883", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "score": 3}, {"id": "311810", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "score": 3}, {"id": "323204", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "score": 3}, {"id": "329803", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "score": 3}, {"id": "331491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "score": 3}, {"id": "355133", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gerard Piqu\u00e9"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Piqu\u00e9", "score": 5}, {"id": "378425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ernesto Valverde"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Valverde", "score": 3}, {"id": "432717", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "score": 3}, {"id": "445029", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Isco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isco", "score": 3}], "image": "http://e1.365dm.com/17/08/150x150/skysports-pique-gerard-barcelona_4073252.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Gerard Pique says Barcelona have plenty of room for improvement", "originalArticle": null}

That suspension has subsequently been extended and Dembele won't play in this weekend's Bundesliga opener.\n\nDortmund have already rejected an opening offer of \u00a390million plus add-ons, with CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke laughing off suggestions from Barcelona general manager Pep Segura that a deal is close: \"I don't know why he (Segura) said that. Barcelona is not one step closer to signing Dembele,\" Watzke declared on Thursday.\n\n\"I can not explain what he is telling me. Maybe it's because Real played his team dizzy in the Super Cup.\"\n\n\"Nothing has advanced, not even by a millimetre.\"\n\nHowever, Dembele has now reportedly departed the property he has rented from Klopp and his wife, leaving behind a mess both inside and outside the property.\n\nPictures show open garbage bags strewn across the garden, furniture and clothing left behind and - fittingly given the situation he has left at BVB - Bild describes the scene as \"chaos\".\n\nWhether he returns after a weekend in his homeland remains in question, with Peter Bosz, the BVB boss, having said: \"I have no idea how exactly this will turn out in the end.\"\n\nDembele's actions have been criticised by teammates. Sokratis declared this week: \"Ousmane's a good boy, but no player is bigger than the team. We need players that want to be part of the family.

The 20-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona but Dortmund are refusing to sell, which has led him to take matters in his own hands.\n\nLast week, Dortmund confirmed they had rejected an offer - said to be worth \u20ac100m - and suspended the France international until further notice after he failed to report to training. The club have not ruled out a transfer, however, with reports suggesting the Bundesliga side are seeking a fee closer to \u20ac130m. Meanwhile, Barcelona's general manager Pep Segura confirmed that deals for Dembele and Philippe Coutinho are close.\n\nSokrates, who is among the most respected players in the Dortmund side, has urged Dembele to learn a few things from his fellow teammate Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who also has offers from a host of clubs but has never tried to force a deal.\n\n\"Ousmane is a good boy,\" Sokratis told Kicker. \"He must understand that no player is bigger than the team, and everyone has to understand that he has to work for the team and to settle down, and so does Ousmane, he can not do what he wants, and he has an example to take from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \"\n\n\"Auba has also been linked with a move but he is very professional in every game and every training and has done three goals in the first cup round. Ousmane was not there, Ousmane did not take a strike, he should not forget that he still has a long contract in Dortmund.\"\n\nWhen asked if Dembele still has any semblance of hope to mend ties with Dortmund, Sokratis added: \"First of all, he has to report back to us and to the training, and then we'll see; Ousmane has given us a lot, he is a player who makes the difference. We also need players who do not want to be a part of our family.

A 2-0 defeat at the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday night saw Barcelona humiliated by their rivals, with Sergio Ramos winding up Lionel Messi by throwing the ball over him after the Argentine readied his hands to collect.\n\nThe victory means Zinedine Zidane now has won seven trophies in his 20 months in charge, in which time he has lost just seven matches. Goals from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema sealed this latest triumph, as Barcelona appeared to again struggle without Neymar, who joined Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record fee earlier this month.\n\n\"This a long process and there is room for improvement, but in the nine years that I have been here, it is the first time that I feel inferior to Madrid,\" Piqu\u00e9 said. \"We are not in the best moment, either as a team or as a club.

The Argentine's performances have dropped recently, while the new signing is an unknown quantity.\n\nBarcelona's frailties in defence were exposed by Real Madrid in their recent 5-1 aggregate humbling by their arch rivals in the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nManager Ernesto Valverde, however, is said to be happy with his options at the moment, and the report claims that Mina could be loaned out for a year if Barcelona's current crop improve their performances before the start of 2018.\n\nThe Camp Nou outfit, meanwhile, are still in the market to strengthen their attack following Neymar's world-record \u20ac222m (\u00a3198m) move to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe La Liga side have identified Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho as potential replacements and are in the process of negotiating with Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, respectively.\n\nBarcelona general manager Pep Segura revealed on Thursday (17 August) that moves for the duo were close, but both the clubs have since dismissed his

{"id": 225055704, "title": "Trump just endorsed this Virginia congressional candidate whose social media isn\u2019t so MAGA", "text": "Congressional candidate John McGuire of Virginia received Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement Monday in a closely-watched Republican primary campaign against incumbent Rep. Bob Good, chairman of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. The June 18 primary in Virginia\u2019s conservative 5th Congressional District is tantamount to winning the general election, and the campaign between McGuire and Good has been mostly about which candidate has the greater fealty to Trump. ALSO READ: 8 ways Trump doesn\u2019t become president But two of McGuire\u2019s social media posts after the Jan. 6 insurrection \u2014 discovered by Raw Story \u2014 raise questions about whether he adheres to Trump\u2019s hard line on election denial and pardons for Jan. 6 convicts. While Trump has vowed to pardon Jan. 6 insurrectionists \u2014 he called them \u201chostages\u201d \u2014 as one of his first acts in office, McGuire mourned the death of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. The officer died of two strokes a day after fighting to protect the Capitol from rioters. The medical examiner said Sicknick died of natural causes but \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition.\u201d In 2023, a federal judge sentenced Capitol attacker Julian Khater to 80 months in prison for assaulting three officers, including Sicknick, with bear spray. A week after the insurrection, McGuire said of Sicknick, \u201cHis death was tragic, unnecessary, & I agree those responsible must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d McGuire wrote. \u201cThank you for your service. RIP.\u201d Another post by McGuire in January 2021 appears to conflict with election denial by Trump and his followers \u2014 and laud one half of the Biden-Harris 2020 presidential ticket. McGuire wrote that \u201cI\u2019m not at all happy with the 2020 election results,\u201d but he praised Kamala Harris for becoming the first female vice president. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that we live in the greatest country in history where a man or a woman can work hard and achieve just about anything. We must never stop fighting to keep it that way!\u201d McGuire did not immediately respond to Raw Story\u2019s request for comment about his past social media posts and whether he stands by them. Flap over Ron DeSantis During the 2024 Republican presidential primary, Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president over Trump \u2014 before switching to Trump when DeSantis bowed out. This infuriated Trump. It wasn\u2019t enough for Trump that Good attended the former president\u2019s criminal trial in Manhattan earlier this month where Trump faces 34 felony charges. Trump recently said on social media that Good\u2019s gesture was \u201ctoo late\u201d and \u201cthe damage had been done!\u201d Trump further accused Good of having \u201cturned his back on our incredible movement.\u201d Trump said McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, \u201cwill always put America first\u201d and \u201cHe is strong on crime, will protect our great Military/Vets, and will always defend our under siege Second Amendment.\u201d McGuire has said he attended Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, which led to the insurrection. But he said he did not enter the Capitol. McGuire has not debated Good.

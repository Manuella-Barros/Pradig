The firing on Thursday came after the Maple Leafs were unable to win a round in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs. They were eliminated in seven games to the Boston Bruins.\n\nKeefe, who was originally hired by former Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, spent five seasons coaching the Maple Leafs since 2019-20. In 349 games, Keefe had a record of 212 wins, 97 regulation losses, and 40 losses in extra time, for a winning percentage of .665.\n\nEven though the Maple Leafs made the qualification round of the 2020 Stanley Cup Playoffs (lost to the Columbus Blue Jackets), and the playoffs the next four years afterwards, Toronto only won one series with Keefe as their head coach. That came in 2023, when the Maple Leafs beat the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.\n\nThe one word that best described the Maple Leafs's first round playoff series with the Boston Bruins was disarray. The Maple Leafs forwards of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander were seen arguing on the bench in game four. After the argument took place, Matthews did not play games five and six with an illness. In game seven with Matthews back, the Maple Leafs lost 2-1 to the Bruins in a tight checking affair. Even though Keefe received praise by many during the Bruins/Maple Leafs series for instituting a successful defensive zone game strategy that made things challenging for the Bruins to generate offense, it is a fair assessment that the reduction in team chemistry among the Maple Leafs superstars was a major contributing factor to Keefe's demise.\n\nKeefe had been with the Maple Leafs organization a significant amount of time. In addition to coaching the Maple Leafs, Keefe coached the Marlies from 2015 to 2019.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sports Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_freeborn@thesportsdaily.com", "name": "Jeremy Freeborn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dubas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dubas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://thesportsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sheldon-keefe2-e1715279447216.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554497", "eventUri": "eng-9554497", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

I'm forever grateful for the opportunity to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs. It's a dream come true for a boy from Brampton. I want to thank Kyle Dubas, Lou Lamoriello, Brad Treliving, Brandon Pridham, Brendan Shanahan, Larry Tanenbaum and the MLSE board for giving me this opportunity to work with the Marlies and Leafs. I didn't get it done in the playoffs. I didn't help push our team over the line and deliver. I accept responsibility for that. No excuses. That's the job. I didn't get it done. It's the reality of the business and I accept it.\"\n\nKeefe continued his message by thanking the Maple Leafs players, fans, support staff and media before saying that he is not sure what he will do next.\n\n\"To the players, I appreciate all your efforts. Your talents and your work ethic made me look good on a lot of nights,\" Keefe said. \"Anyone who suited up for blue and white, I appreciate you. To the support staff of the Maple Leafs, you're tremendous people. You're elite at what you do. Players and support staff will drive the team to success. I believe it will win. Leafs nation, you deserve your Stanley Cup. Your passion at home and on the road is unmatched. It's an incredible honor to coach the Maple Leafs to try to deliver for you. To the media, I had to deal with you every single day, sometimes twice a day, three times a day, I appreciate your process. I respected the fact that you're honest and fair, and had a job to do. I hope you appreciated the fact that I helped you do it. I don't know what comes next, but I know I'll be ready for it. In the meantime, I'll enjoy giving my the time that they deserve. Love you all. Be well.\"\n\nSheldon Keefe's coaching career\n\nKeefe took over the Maple Leafs during the 2019-2020 season, and led the team to a 27-15-5 record, according to Hockey Reference. He took over during the middle of that season after Mike Babcock was fired that November. Overall, he had a 212-97-40 record as head coach.\n\nThe Maple Leafs went to the playoffs in all five of the seasons that Keefe was behind the bench for Toronto, but disappointed in each of them. The Maple Leafs went out early in the bubble in 2020, then lost in the first round the following two seasons.\n\nIn 2023, Keefe led the Maple Leafs to the second round before losing to the Florida Panthers, which was the furthest the organization went in a long time at that point. Ultimately, this year's loss to the Bruins was the last straw.\n\nIt would be a bit surprising if we do not see Keefe behind the bench coaching an NHL team at some point soon, given the regular season success he had.

The Maple Leafs won just one playoff series since Keefe took over in November 2019.\n\n\"Today's decision was difficult,\" general manager Brad Treliving said in a statement. \"Sheldon is an excellent coach and a great man. However, we determined a new voice is needed to help the team push through to reach our ultimate goal.\"\n\nIn a video message posted on social media, Keefe said he was forever grateful for the opportunity to coach the Maple Leafs, which he called \"a dream come true for a boy from Brampton,\" his home outside Toronto. He also acknowledged how the results were not exactly what he dreamed up.\n\n\"I didn't get it done in the playoffs,\" Keefe said. \"I didn't help push our team over the line and deliver. I accept responsibility for that. No excuses. That's the job. I didn't get it done. It's the reality of the business, and I accept it.\"\n\nAfter the league's 19th coaching change since the end of the 2022-23 season, the team said the search for Keefe's replacement will begin immediately. Treliving and other members of management are expected to address reporters Friday about the coaching change and other end-of-season topics.\n\nKeefe, 43, joined the organization in 2015 as coach of the American Hockey League's Toronto Marlies thanks in large part to his junior hockey connection to then-assistant general manager Kyle Dubas, who was promoted and spent five season as GM before being fired last year. Keefe replaced Mike Babcock when Dubas fired him weeks into the 2019-20 season.\n\nWhat followed were some excellent regular seasons and trips to the playoffs without much else to show for it. Coached by Keefe and with a core led by Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, Morgan Rielly and John Tavares, the Leafs went 16-21 in the postseason.\n\nEarlier this week, Keefe said that while he accepts responsibility for expectations not being met, his confidence in the group's -- and his own -- ability to succeed was at an all-time high.\n\n\"Now more than ever, I believe in myself and our team,\" Keefe said. \"That I will win and our team will win.\"\n\nThat winning in Toronto, if it happens, will be under a different coach. Among the experienced options available are 2019 Stanley Cup winner Craig Berube, veteran Bruce Boudreau, former Minnesota coach Dean Evason and former Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that there have been 19 coaching changes, not 18, in the NHL since the end of the 2022-23 season.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Marlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Marlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dubas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dubas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Berube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Berube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Evason", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Evason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Boudreau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd McLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Babcock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Babcock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junior ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/11/do_not_delete_sports-2023-11-e67ff22d7739531b4934072abdcbdf60-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554497", "eventUri": "eng-9554497", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 384}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Overall, Berube played 1,054 regular-season games for five different franchises, including 40 games for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nThe retired player, who manned the left wing, is 58 years old and he's coached for eight seasons in the NHL with his first one coming in 2013-14 at the helm of the Philadelphia Flyers. He spent a couple of years in Philly before taking a four-year hiatus before joining St. Louis.\n\nAs the head coach of the Blues, Berube went on to win the 2019 Stanley Cup in his first season with the organization as an interim coach, a position he took over with the campaign already started. He stayed in St. Louis until earlier this year, when the franchise fired him on Dec. 12 just 28 games into the 2023-24 season with the Blues having a 13-14-1 record and 27 points.\n\nFollowing his firing on December 2023, Berube told The Atheltic \"I want to make sure I'm going to a good organization\" when asked about what he would do in the future.\n\n\"You want to work with good people, and you always want an opportunity to win,\" Berube told Jeremy Rutherford in an interview published on December 16. I want to coach, but I want to make sure that it's the right situation.\"\n\nThe writing was on the wall when it came to Sheldon Keefe's future (or lack of it) within the organization, even though he signed a two-year extension on August 26, 2023, set to kick off next fall.\n\n\"Sheldon is an excellent coach and a great man; however, we determined a new voice is needed to help the team push through to reach our ultimate goal,\" Leafs general manager Brad Treliving said in the franchise's official statement.\n\nThat has been Keefe's main failure in his four-and-a-half seasons as the head coach of the Leafs: making deep runs in the postseason, let alone winning the Stanley Cup or getting even remotely close to doing so.\n\nKeefe took over the position in November 2019 as the interim coach after the Leafs fired Mike Babcock. He went on to post a 212-97-40 regular-season record reaching the playoffs in his four full seasons with the Leafs.\n\nOnce in the playoffs, however, Toronto only got past the first round once in four years and never won more than five games in a single postseason run.\n\nThis season ended in another first-round defeat, this time at the hands of the Boston Bruins with the definitive Game 7 played on Saturday, May 4, and sealing Keefe's fate.\n\nKeefe published a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the official announcement of his firing on May 9 in which he took the blame for the lack of playoff success during his time in Toronto.\n\n\"I didn't get it done in the playoffs, I didn't help push our team over the line and deliver,\" Keefe started. \"I accept responsibility for that, no excuses.

Per the team's release, they \"relieved\" him of his duties. What a great word.\n\nFor five years, Keefe tried to get his luxury island of misfit toys to understand the difference between regular-season effort and playoff effort. The players stonewalled him that entire time.\n\nThen, right at the end, when all hope was lost, they decided to listen. And it worked. It worked right up until all the big guys he'd been hired to get through to took a group nap on the ice during overtime in a Game 7.\n\nAfter that, Keefe must have been begging to feel the cold hand of professional death.\n\nHe went through the motions of pretending to want to stay, because no other team wants to hire a quitter. But the fight in him was gone.\n\n\"Today's decision was difficult,\" GM Brad Treliving said in the release.\n\nNo, it wasn't. Keeping him - that would have been difficult. That would have been the equivalent of putting a chair against the door and daring the city to come and get you. Firing him was the easy choice, and the merciful one.\n\nKeefe joins a long list of men who've landed The Greatest Job in Hockey\u00ae and come out the other end in small chunks. Mike Babcock, Mike Murphy, Peter Horachek, Ron Wilson, Doug Carpenter, Dan Maloney and so on and so forth. They're all brave, but no one survives the reputational wood chipper that is Toronto.\n\nSo who's up next?\n\nThe general rule in hockey is a bully, followed by a buddy.\n\nRemember when Keefe first arrived and seemed happy in his work? Excited to learn about everyone and bring out the best in them? Yeah, that didn't last long.\n\nBy the end, Keefe's default was a deflated mumble and none of his buddies in the locker room bothered to say a meaningful word in his defence. So much for the special bond of the locker room.\n\nSo it'll be a bully.\n\nAnother rule is a safe choice follows a risk. Because he'd never coached in the NHL before, Keefe was the hipster's pick. That went about as well as it ever does.\n\nEvery Leafs coach you could reasonably describe as great died before the Internet was a thing, but there once was a tradition of hiring cards. Guys who enjoyed the back and forth, or could tell a story. Someone who could relieve his players of the burden of carrying the news cycle.\n\nKeefe wasn't that guy, nor was Mike Babcock before him, or the last few guys before that. As the Leafs have become more and more corporate, their coaches reflect that.\n\nIn Toronto, you've got two choices - you can win or you can be amusing. Because winning's off the table, you've really only got one choice.\n\nIf you had to design the perfect next Leafs coach, he would be someone the fans know. Someone who has a bigger personality than his players. Someone with charisma. Maybe a vicious streak. Someone who knows how to play old-school mind games. Someone you'd like to have a beer with.\n\nI think I've got it - nobody.\n\nNobody can do those things in Toronto any more, because no one has in 20 years. If they could, they would.\n\nYou look down the list of bookies' picks and it is more of the same - Craig Berube, Bruce Boudreau, Gerard Gallant, Todd McLellan, et al.\n\nAll fine people, I'm sure. All unemployed for a reason. Not an original idea among them. Company men. Absolutely perfect for Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment.\n\nOnce you've been a head coach in the NHL, the only way you can be removed from the rumour mill is to die first. It's the same people bringing the same energy with the same results.\n\nThere are no more Scotty Bowmans. Tampa's Jon Cooper is the closest thing, and why would he leave the sweet life in Florida to work for a basketcase like MLSE?\n\nPicking from the dozen or so men available on the coaching carousel at any given time hasn't worked in 50 years. So, yeah, why not try it again? I'm sure the 26th time will be the charm.\n\nIf the Leafs really wanted change - which they absolutely do not - they'd get rid of the box. Maybe the same old Canadians and Americans we all know from turgid panels on Sportsnet or ESPN are not the answer. Surely, there is a coach in Europe who might bring something vaguely new to the mix. Anything would be better than this.\n\nA visionary outfit might risk more than that. When England's Southampton Football Club made it back to the Premiership, it accepted it was outclassed and outgunned. The usual way of doing things was not going to help it.\n\nIn search of new ideas, it hired a hockey coach, Ralph Krueger, as director. That began the most successful period in the club's modern history. For just a moment there, Southampton was the most ahead-of-the-curve sports franchise in the world.\n\nWould the Leafs try something like that? Of course not. That sounds too much like fun. The arena's full. The fans aren't picky. Why bother?\n\nBetter to go with the guys everyone knows already. World-weary types who think they've seen everything.\n\nAfter 12 months in the paint shaker that is Toronto, they have either gone frothing mad or stopped talking altogether.\n\nIt's not a hockey job. It's a crucible. You're not here to win. You're here to suffer. It would take a very special person to break that cycle. A type we don't see in the NHL.\n\nAnd that's the real problem with picking a Leafs coach from the usual suspects - wanting the job should disqualify you from getting it.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Babcock", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Babcock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Horachek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Horachek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wilson_(ice_hockey,_born_1955)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wilson (ice hockey, born 1955)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Maloney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Maloney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Carpenter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Carpenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Sports_&_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Gallant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerard Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Berube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Berube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Krueger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Krueger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Boudreau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cooper_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cooper (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd McLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/AAR3LJYBPFDUPNCX6G5RXI3H44.jpg?auth=90836475475340e1fa22886d24d711326bfb48cf7179d887a525f4da2398f00d&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554497", "eventUri": "eng-9554497", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

They could have been waiting to see if Sheldon Keefe would become available, which he did on Wednesday morning when the Toronto Maple Leafs fired him.\n\nNow that Keffe is available, does it make sense for him to switch conferences and take the role in Winnipeg?\n\nThree reasons why the Winnipeg Jets should avoid hiring Sheldon Keefe as the next head coach\n\n#3. Time off could be critical to Keefe's future\n\nKeefe landed his first professional coaching job in 2006, serving as an assistant coach with the Pembroke Lumber Kings, the franchise he owned. Eventually, he would become general manager and head coach.\n\nAfter selling the franchise in 2013, Keefe moved to the Ontario Hockey League, where he coached the Soo Greyhounds. He advanced to the Toronto Marlies in 2016, won a Calder Cup, and landed the head coaching job with the Maple Leafs in November 2019.\n\nEven though it's impressive to see Keefe work his way up through the ranks, he's only had one job in the NHL, and maybe a season away could allow him to regroup and find his next job instead of rushing into another commitment.\n\nHe's going to be paid by the Maple Leafs while sitting at home, and with an exceptional number of coaching vacancies, there could be even better opportunities in late 2024 and 2025 for him to pursue.\n\n#2. Roster construction is entirely different\n\nThe Maple Leafs have over 40% of their salary cap devoted to four players: Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, and John Tavares. In Winnipeg, no single player makes more than 8.6% of their cap, with just Mark Scheifele and Connor Hellebuyck set to make identical $8.5 million next season.\n\nThe Jets just finished one of their best seasons in franchise history, and despite being located in a major Canadian city, they could be labeled as a small-market team. Fans still care deeply about their team, but ownership doesn't have the same resources as the Maple Leafs.\n\nIf Keefe ended up in Winnipeg, he'd still be in the spotlight, just not as bright as Toronto. Considering how differently constructed the two lineups are, they are almost identical.\n\nHellebuyck is the elite netminder the Maple Leafs needed, while Nylander is the game-breaker the Jets could use. Believe it or not, Keefe would continue on the steady path of coaching a good enough team, still missing pieces to be a true contender.\n\n#1. Replacing a legacy coach with a big-name\n\nBowness weaved his presence into the hearts and minds of the Winnipeg fans as everyone wanted to get him his first Stanley Cup ring. Although that didn't happen, and he was only behind the bench for two seasons, he will be a tough act to follow.\n\nKeefe is now among the top coaches available and looking for a job. The Jets could bring him aboard to run the show, giving the reins to another big name, but they would miss an opportunity to provide the job to an upcoming coach with something to prove.\n\nUnfortunately, NHL teams tend to recycle head coaches, and the next bench boss in Winnipeg will be a former coach who was in the league last season with a different club.

The disappointment, which included a seven-game elimination at the hands of the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup First Round, was, in his opinion, on him.\n\nAs such, it should come as no surprise that Keefe was fired as coach of the Maple Leafs on Thursday. For a franchise that has one postseason series win in 20 years, change was needed. In fact, in the minds of the team's long-suffering fan base, it was demanded.\n\nLess than two hours after the Maple Leafs announced the firing, Keefe took to social media with a video thanking Toronto fans, ownership, staff, even the media, for the chance given to a kid from nearby Brampton, Ontario, to live out a dream and coach the Maple Leafs.\n\nAt the same time, he blamed no one but himself for his fate. That message stayed constant.\n\n\"I didn't get it done in the playoffs. I didn't help our team push it over the line and deliver. I accept responsibility for that. No excuses,\" Keefe said.\n\nUnlike their soon-to-be-fired coach, there were no soliloquies from them Monday accepting fault for yet another year of falling well short of their goal of a Stanley Cup, something the franchise hasn't won since 1967.\n\nInstead, there were plenty of claims of what a tight-knit group they were, and how close they came.\n\nBut what exactly do they think they came close to?\n\nWinning a first-round series? Sure. They were one shot away from that, only to have Bruins forward David Pastrnak squash those hopes 1:54 into overtime of Game 7 on Saturday.\n\nBut close to winning a Stanley Cup?

The Maple Leafs won just one playoff series since Keefe took over in November 2019.\n\n\"Today's decision was difficult,\" GM Brad Treliving said in a statement. \"Sheldon is an excellent coach and a great man. However, we determined a new voice is needed to help the team push through to reach our ultimate goal.\"\n\nIn a video message posted on social media, Keefe said he was forever grateful for the opportunity to coach the Maple Leafs, which he called \"a dream come true for a boy from Brampton,\" his home outside Toronto. He also acknowledged how the results were not exactly what he dreamed up.\n\n\"I didn't get it done in the playoffs,\" Keefe said. \"I didn't help push our team over the line and deliver. I accept responsibility for that. No excuses. That's the job. I didn't get it done. It's the reality of the business, and I accept it.\"\n\nAfter the league's 19th coaching change since the end of the 2022-23 season, the team said the search for Keefe's replacement will begin immediately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreliving and other members of management are expected to address reporters Friday about the coaching change and other end-of-season topics.\n\nKeefe, 43, joined the organization in 2015 as coach of the American Hockey League's Toronto Marlies thanks in large part to his junior hockey connection to then-assistant general manager Kyle Dubas, who was promoted and spent five season as GM before being fired last year. Keefe replaced Mike Babcock when Dubas fired him weeks into the 2019-20 season.\n\nWhat followed were some excellent regular seasons and trips to the playoffs without much else to show for it. Coached by Keefe and with a core led by Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, Morgan Rielly and John Tavares, the Leafs went 16-21 in the postseason.\n\nEarlier this week, Keefe said that while he accepts responsibility for expectations not being met, his confidence in the group's -- and his own -- ability to succeed was at an all-time high.\n\n\"Now more than ever, I believe in myself and our team,\" Keefe said. \"That I will win and our team will win.\"\n\nThat winning in Toronto, if it happens, will be under a different coach. Among the experienced options available are 2019 Stanley Cup winner Craig Berube, veteran Bruce Boudreau, former Minnesota coach Dean Evason and former Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan.\n\nUTAH: Ownership of the NHL's team in Utah has given fans 20 choices to vote on for the franchise's new name, according to a survey sent out Wednesday by Smith Entertainment Group.\n\nOwner Ryan Smith has told The Associated Press the team will have a name starting with Utah. The inaugural season will feature jerseys with the name of the state on them, with a name, logo and colors to debut for 2025-26 after work done by the branding company Doubleday & Cartwright.\n\n\"Utah's NHL team is a community asset, and we want to make sure that the community has a say in what the name is,\" said Smith, whose group also owns the NBA's Utah Jazz. \"Utah has shown up for this team from the moment the NHL awarded us the franchise less than three weeks ago, and it is only fitting that our fans get the rare opportunity to help name the team they'll be cheering for.\"\n\nThe options provided to choose from are Frost, Ice, Powder, Mountaineers, Freeze, Mammoth, Black Diamonds, Blast, Caribou, Blizzard, Swarm, Hive, Outlaws, Yeti, Squall, Fury, Glaciers, Canyons, Venom and HC, which stands for Hockey Club.\n\nSEG bought the Arizona Coyotes from former owner Alex Meruelo for $1.2 billion and relocated the team to Salt Lake City. Utah will start play in the Jazz's downtown arena, Delta Center. It has the sixth pick in the NHL draft after not moving up in the lottery won Tuesday night by San Jose.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

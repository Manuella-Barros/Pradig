Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez: Odds, Records, Prediction", "body": "Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez has already proven he's a force in the lower weight classes, and it's getting clearer that he has the kind of skills to eventually crash the top-10 pound-for-pound list. But on Saturday, he'll face his toughest challenge yet against a future Hall of Famer in Juan Francisco Estrada. And Estrada isn't quite ready to anoint Rodriguez as the new face at 115 pounds. Here's everything you need to know about Juan Francisco Estrada vs. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win.\n\nEstrada is one of the best super flyweights of his era (and what an era it was with Estrada, Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez, Srisaket Sor Rungivisai and Carlos Cuadras among others), but he's 34 years old and hasn't fought in 18 months. Meanwhile, Rodriguez has been active and beating the likes of Sor Rungvisai and Cuadras.\n\nBut Estrada isn't willing to proclaim Rodriguez a 115-pound king (and to be fair, Estrada is the champion at super flyweight; Rodriguez is the unified titlist in the 112-pound flyweight division).\n\n\"I think Bam is a good fighter; you do have to say that,\" Estrada said. \"But I think if you look at his best victories like [Carlos] Cuadras and [Srisaket Sor] Rungvisai, then those guys were on the way out. The only good victory that he's had was the Sunny Edwards fight . . . Obviously that was at a lower weight and we'll have to see what he's like up here fighting against me at this higher weight class because I think that will be the difference on the night.\"\n\nEstrada cited his winning mentality and said he wouldn't mind seeing a stoppage win against Rodriguez. But Estrada hasn't scored a KO since 2020, and Rodriguez's chin hasn't yet been dented.\n\nEven though Rodriguez said he watched plenty of Estrada fights when he was growing up and said sharing the ring with his opponent will be an honor, he feels he has something to prove.\n\n\"This is a very important fight for me,\" Rodriguez said. \" . . . He said a few things discrediting my wins against Cuadras and Sor Rungvisai, so that on top of fighting for his world title makes it as big as can be. I wouldn't call it personal to the point where I am mad about what he said, but I do want to prove him wrong and show him that I am the truth, the real deal. On Saturday, he's going to see.\"\n\nHere's more info on the Juan Francisco Estrada vs. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on DAZN beginning at 9:30 p.m. ET on Saturday.\n\nThe closer this fight gets, the more money that's coming in on Rodriguez. As of this writing, Rodriguez was the -600 favorite (bet $600 to win $100), while Estrada was the +400 underdog (win $400 on a $100 wager). When this fight was first announced, Rodriguez was -375 and Estrada was +275. So, if you like Estrada, perhaps it's worth waiting just a little bit longer to see if his odds continue to get longer.\n\nIf you were looking for a fun parlay for this weekend's action of boxing (and this is only for entertainment purposes), I might take Rodriguez to beat Estrada at -600, Teofimo Lopez to beat Steve Claggett at -900 and Sunny Edwards to beat Adrian Curiel by decision at -250. If all of those hit, you'd win $81 on a $100 wager. Which means that parlay isn't worth it. So, you'd have to take some chances. If you grabbed Lopez to win by stoppage at -125, Rodriguez to win by decision at -120 and Edwards to win by decision at -250, you'd win $320 on that same $100 wager.\n\nThere's a reason Estrada is going to be a Hall of Famer. He has a record of 44-3 (28 KOs), and he's beaten the best fighters in this era, including Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez twice, Srisaket Sor Rungvisai, Carlos Cuadras twice and Brian Viloria. His three losses have come to Gonzalez, Sor Rungvisai and Juan Carlos Sanchez Jr., in an eight-round fight in 2011. He ended up knocking out Sanchez in a rematch, meaning Estrada is one of those rare pugilists who's beaten every fighter he's ever faced.\n\nRodriguez (19-0, 12 KOs) is on an impressive run right now, coming off wins against Sunny Edwards, Sor Rungvisai and Cuadras. Rodriguez has already faced some excellent fighters. But Estrada has the biggest name of all.\n\nThis is going to be the hardest fight of Rodriguez's life. But he's younger, fresher and more active than Estrada, and I don't think Estrada should have been given the victory in his last fight vs. Chocolatito. Rodriguez is going to out-punch Estrada and claim a close decision win, somewhere in the 115-113 range.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Francisco_Estrada", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Francisco Estrada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Cuadras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Cuadras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunny Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Viloria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Viloria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srisaket_Sor_Rungvisai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Srisaket Sor Rungvisai"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/667e324b3b32c0fef7d53a8f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693751", "eventUri": "eng-9693751", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Estrada recovered well in the third, but in Round 4, Rodriguez knocked him down with a perfectly thrown left uppercut, straight left combination.\n\nRodriguez, 24, kept landing his punches in the next round, all set up by his lead jab. Another straight left pushed Estrada to the ropes, and the uppercut and left hand kept landing flush. Rodriguez's speed and power were superior to Estrada's.\n\nThough Rodriguez appeared to be in total control, Estrada, 34, dropped him in the sixth round with a straight right hand set up by two lead jabs. Rodriguez recovered well and continued landing his left hand and right uppercut.\n\nWith just seconds to go in Round 7, Rodriguez landed a left hook to the body that sent Estrada to the canvas. Estrada was visibly in pain and couldn't recover in time.\n\n\"I got him with a good body shot,\" Rodriguez said during the postfight interview. \"I saw the way he was rolling on the floor.

Estrada fought for the first time since his trilogy fight against future Hall of Famer Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez in December 2022, a career-long 18-month layoff.\n\nEstrada (44-4, 28 KOs) was riding an eight-fight winning streak. The last time he lost a fight before Saturday was more than six years ago, a majority decision to Srisaket Sor Rungvisai in February 2018 that he avenged one year later.\n\nEstrada could have one more big fight in him. The future Hall of Famer has a rematch clause and said after the fight that he was going to exercise that option.\n\n\"I know the mistakes that I made in there and I want the rematch,\" Estrada said. \"So we'll take that rematch and there's no doubt we'll win that rematch.\"\n\nRodriguez is knocking at the door of the pound-for-pound top 10 list.

Surprisingly, so few boxing fans pick Juan Francisco Estrada to defeat 'Bam' Rodriguez.\n\nEstrada didn't look his best in his last two fights, but his motivation will be high tonight against Rodriguez, given that so few fans are giving him a chance in this fight.\n\nThey feel this is a cakewalk for Bam. However, Rodriguez had huge problems the last time he fought at 115 in his fight against Israel Gonzalez in September 2022, and Estrada sees this as a signal that he's not suited to the super flyweight division.\n\nFormer IBF flyweight champion Sunny Edwards (20-1, 4 KO) will look to bounce back from his recent loss when he takes on Adrian Curiel (24-5-1, 5 KO) in the 12-round chief support bout in the 112-lb division.\n\nSunny could steal the show with an impressive performance against Curiel.

The fights can be seen an DAZN via paid subscription, though a crowd of perhaps 10,000 fight fans could turn out.\n\nEstrada, 34, figures to have more of the crowd on his side, being from Sonora, Arizona's southern neighbor in Mexico, and feels his experience will be the difference against the 24-year-old Rodriguez, from San Antonio.\n\nRodriguez moved up to super flyweight after winning the IBF and WBO world flyweight championship belts from his last fight, which was last December in Glendale, Ariz. at Desert Diamond Arena.\n\nMore information on the fights, with live updates of all the action from Phoenix:\n\nWhen does the Juan Francisco Estrada vs. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez fight start?\n\nThere are four bouts on the main card starting at 6:30 p.m. in Phoenix, which conclude with the title fight between Estrada and Rodriguez.\n\nHow to watch Juan Francisco Estrada vs. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez main event\n\nCost: Subscription to DAZN required, $19.99 per month for 12 months, one-month pass for $29.99, full-year subscription for $224. 99.\n\nJuan Francisco Estrada vs. Jesse Rodriguez undercard\n\n'Before the Bell' fights\n\nGabriel Muratalla (11-0) vs. Carlos Fontes (23-3-1), bantamweight\n\nFabian Rojo (8-0) fighting out of Phoenix) vs. Daniel Gonzalez (5-1), welterweight\n\nLeonardo Rubalcava (7-0) vs. William Flenoy (3-3-1), super lightweight\n\nJuan Francisco Estrada vs Jesse Rodriguez prediction\n\nExperience is squarely on Estrada's side in this fight, but he hasn't fought since December of 2022, an epic war with Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.

Rodriguez overcame that slight hiccup to brutalize Juan Francisco Estrada, whom he knocked out to win the RING and WBC 115-pound championship. A left hand to the body forced Estrada to the canvas, where he was counted at at the end of the seventh round Saturday evening at Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n\"To be in the ring with 'Gallo' -- a legend -- and to take his belt, is just incredible,\" Rodriguez told DAZN's Chris Mannix.\n\nThe venue was the site of Rodriguez's first title win. It happened to be the WBC 115-pound title that Estrada relinquished in exchange for the sanctioning body's 'Franchise' champion designation. Rodriguez (20-0, 13 knockouts) had just celebrated his 22nd birthday when he accepted a vacant title fight versus former titlist Carlos Cuadras on just six days' notice.\n\nEstrada (44-4, 28 KOs) looked to establish his textbook jab in the opening round of his first fight in nearly 19 months.\n\nThe legendary two-division champ hadn't fought since a majority decision win over Roman 'Chocolatito' Gonzalez (51-4-1, 41 KOs). Rodriguez was prepared for anything that the defending champ had to offer and was a step ahead during most exchanges. A straight left hand by the 24-year-old southpaw briefly caused Estrada to back up. Rodriguez continued to inch forward and counter Estrada, who at least managed a check left hook.\n\nA relatively competitive first quickly transitioned to a showcase performance by boxing's best young star.\n\nRodriguez's time at 115 was brief -- just eight months on the title stage, before he relinquished to campaign at flyweight.\n\nRodriguez's angles and footwork rarely provided a clean target for Estrada. Right hands and left hooks by Estrada hit his challenger's gloves. Rodriguez landed a left hand, pivoted and landed another before Estrada had the chance to reset.\n\nThe sign of trouble ahead came late in round three. Estrada was rocked by Rodriguez roughly one minute into the third. Rodriguez went on the attack but the long-reigning RING champ was able to remain upright.\n\nIt wasn't the case for long.\n\nRodriguez produced the first knockdown of the fight in the fourth. Estrada was frozen in place by an uppercut, after which Rodriguez slammed home a straight left. Estrada hit the deck but managed to beat the count and make it out of the round. His legs still hadn't fully recovered even as he sat on his stool in between rounds.\n\nEstrada was hurt once again midway through round five. Rodriguez drove his elder statesmen into the ropes and landed a swarm of punches, through a disciplined attack. Estrada managed to make it out of the round but there drew concern over how much longer he could last.\n\nNever count out a future Hall of Famer.\n\nEstrada breathed new life into the one-sided fight with a right hand at the start of round six. Rodriguez was out of position for perhaps the lone time in the fight and suffered his first career knockdown.\n\nIt was a welcomed experience and means to close the show for the rising pound-for-pound star.\n\n\"I got dropped for the first time, that was crazy,\" noted Rodriguez. \"I got caught with a punch and next thing you know, I was on the floor. It was crazy but I always wanted to experience that. I know it's bad but I want to test myself in times like that.\"\n\nRodriguez passed that test with flying colors.\n\nThe brief moment of success did not at all provide a path for a sustained momentum shift. Estrada remained confident but it was quickly sapped as Rodriguez continued to target the body and also land from all angles.\n\nThen came the spectacular finish.\n\nRodriguez punched in combination throughout the seventh. Estrada often caught air and gloves whenever he let his hands go. Meanwhile, Rodriguez walked down his bigger foe, in his first fight back at 115 in nearly two years.\n\nEstrada drifted towards the ropes when he was caught with a digging left to the body. Another one by Rodriguez forced Estrada to fall and roll in the canvas in pain as referee Chris Flores issued the full ten count.\n\n\"Just to share the ring with them, being on the same poster with them, it's just crazy,\" noted Rodriguez, who is now a four-time titlist and first-time RING champion.", "source": {"uri": "ringtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ring"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_donovan@ringtv.com", "name": "Jake Donovan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Francisco_Estrada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Francisco Estrada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Cuadras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Cuadras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwork_(martial_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Footwork (martial arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ringtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jesse-Bam-Rodriguez-Stands-Over-Fallen-Juan-Francisco-Estrada.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693751", "eventUri": "eng-9693751", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The knockout came one round after Rodriguez was floored by Estrada on a straight hand.\n\nThis was Rodriguez's first victory of 2024 and the second time he won the WBC belt at 115 pounds. Estrada hasn't fought since his trilogy fight against future Hall of Famer Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez in December 2022, a career-long 18-month layoff.\n\nEstrada (44-3, 28 KOs), was riding an eight-fight winning streak. The last time he lost a fight before Saturday was more than six years ago, a majority decision to Srisaket Sor Rungvisai in February 2018 (that he avenged one year later)\n\nEven in defeat and at the age of 34, Estrada could have one more big fight in him. The future Hall of Famer said before the fight that he'd move up in weight for the right opponent.\n\n\"Lots of people say we're too old now but if 'Chocolatito' becomes a champion at bantamweight, a fourth fight would be great,\" Estrada said before Saturday's fight. \"I think to win any world title in any division at our age would be nice and not just anyone could do that. If Chocolatito becomes a champion at bantamweight, we'll go after him or any champion at that weight.\"\n\nRodriguez, one of the best fighters in boxing, is knocking at the door of the pound-for-pound top 10 list. He said after the fight he plans to stay at junior bantamweight and try to unify the titles in a division that sees four different boxers with one belt.\n\nRodriguez, 24, of San Antonio, Texas, is a two-division champion and ESPN's 2023 best fighter under the age of 25. He won the WBC junior bantamweight title in February 2022 in a unanimous decision victory over Carlos Cuadras in a fight where he knocked down Cuadras in Round 3. He defended that belt twice, including an incredible performance in an eighth-round stoppage of Sor Rungvisai in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, Rodriguez moved down in weight to challenge Cristian Gonzalez for the WBO vacant flyweight world title. He suffered a broken jaw in that fight, but managed to win a unanimous decision. Incredibly, he returned just eight months later and dominated Sunny Edwards to add the IBF flyweight title with a ninth-round TKO win.\n\nEstrada, 34, of Sonora, Mexico, has won titles at flyweight and junior bantamweight. He is 2-1 against Gonzalez.

I want the rematch. What i need to do is to box more,\" Estrada said. \"I made errors.

Estrada, on the other hand, caught the challenger hard as Rodriguez was coming in.\n\nThings remained tight in the second, but Estrada was able to find his mark on numerous occasions. Rodriguez tagged the champion with a furious right hook in the third. Estrada survived, but Rodriguez, fighting behind a southpaw jab with high end footwork, dominated his man.

His recent fights have demonstrated his resilience, ring intelligence, and ability to adapt to different styles. Estrada's experience in championship rounds and his tactical acumen make him a formidable opponent.\n\nJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez (19-0, 12 KOs) has been on a rapid rise, showcasing impressive skill and power. His recent victories, including dominant performances against former champions Srisaket Sor Rungvisai, Carlos Cuadras, and Sunny Edwards, have solidified his reputation as one of the most exciting young talents in the sport.

The pair of future Hall of Famers have offered three memorable clashes, with Estrada ahead 2-1 in their series.\n\nA fourth fight was not ruled out after their terrific Dec. 2022 clash, won by Estrada (44-3, 28 knockouts) via majority decision. The 34-year-old from Hermosillo, Mexico first has to get past one of the sport's very best young talents in 24-year-old Jesse 'Bam' Rodriguez (19-0, 12 KOs).\n\nNeedless to say, he is up for the challenge.\n\n\"People sometimes disrespect fighters like me when they say, 'Gallo Estrada is too old now',\" stated Estrada. \"But I'm going to show on Saturday that it isn't true and my career will keep progressing for a good while. \"Lots of people say we're too old now but if Chocolatito becomes a champion at bantamweight, a fourth fight would be great.\"\n\nEstrada-Rodriguez headlines a four-fight DAZN telecast Saturday evening from Footprint Center, home of the NBA's Phoenix Suns. Estrada attempts his seventh defense of The Ring junior bantamweight championship.\n\nThe fight is the first for Estrada since his trilogy clash with Gonzalez (51-4, 41 KOs). Injuries and an inability to secure a unification bout led to his 18-month layoff.\n\nInterestingly, targeted divisional titlists Kazuto Ioka (31-2-1, 16 KOs) and Fernando 'Puma' Martinez (16-0, 9 KOs) will instead face each other. Their July 7 WBA/IBF unification bout pits The Ring's No. 2 and No. 3 junior bantamweights in a terrific matchup in Tokyo.\n\nEstrada still seeks legacy fights in the post-prime portion of a career destined for the Hall of Fame. The two-division champ enters his fourteenth career fight with a major belt or The Ring championship at stake.\n\nIt's a tall task versus the nearly perfect Rodriguez. Still, Estrada is unbeaten in more than six years and has a proven track record at the elite level.\n\nMeanwhile. Gonzalez embarks on his own comeback. The former four-division champion faces Rober Berrera (27-5, 17 KOs) at bantamweight on July 12 at home in Managua, Nicaragua. With a win, the expectation is to race 'Chocolatito' to a bantamweight title shot.\n\nA fifth divisional title for the legendary Nicaraguan would the perfect enticement for Estrada to move up in weight.\n\n\"I think to win any world title in any division at our ages would be nice,\" said Estrada. \"Not just anyone could do that. If Chocolatito becomes a champion at bantamweight, we'll go after him or any champion at that weight.\"\n\nOf course, there remains the matter of upsetting the odds on Saturday.\n\n\"We can have plans and make plans but we have to focus on the fight we have in front of us first,\" acknowledged Estrada. \"If they say they're going to knock me out, beat me and then they're going up a division to face [WBA 118 titlist Takuma] Inoue that's their business but let's see on Saturday.\n\n\"If Jesse Rodr\u00edguez beats me it will because he's a better boxer, not because of anything else like my age. They've been saying a lot that I'm old now, that I'm on my way out and on Saturday, I'm going to show that this isn't the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "ringtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ring"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_donovan@ringtv.com", "name": "Jake Donovan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Francisco_Estrada", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Francisco Estrada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermosillo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hermosillo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hermosillo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuto_Ioka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazuto Ioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Rodriguez_(boxer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Rodriguez (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managua", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Managua"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Managua"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nicaragua"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicaragua"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nicaragua"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ringtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Juan-Francisco-Estrada-Addresses-Phoenix-Media-June-27.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693751", "eventUri": "eng-9693751", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1534}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2160}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Not quite dormant, but nowhere near as active or explosive as it had been in recent years.\n\nIf that's going to change -- and for the sake of the fighters and the fans, hopefully it does -- then that begins with this Saturday's fight between Juan Francisco Estrada and Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez.\n\nTheir contest is the main event at the Footprint Center, a basketball arena in Phoenix, Arizona, and it will air on DAZN. This is a deserving spotlight for a collision between a pound-for-pound stalwart and a rising talent on the verge of stardom.\n\nIt is cause enough for celebration whenever two of the best face each other. Perhaps this fight will also serve as the spark that reignites the 115-pound division, which is also known as junior bantamweight.\n\nLooking at this summer's schedule, Estrada vs. Rodriguez and the other super flyweight fights in the weeks to follow could be the start of something special, returning the 115-pound weight class to the days when one of the deepest divisions in boxing was also one of the most compelling.\n\nThese were the names back then: Carlos Cuadras. Juan Francisco Estrada. Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez. Srisaket Sor Rungvisai. They were called the new \"Four Kings\" of boxing, harkening back to the era when some combination of Roberto Duran, Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Sugar Ray Leonard met a total of nine times over the course of a decade.\n\nCuadras, Estrada, Gonzalez and Sor Rungvisai met a total of 11 times, beginning with the first fight between Chocolatito and Estrada down at junior flyweight in 2012, and concluding about a decade later with their rubber match at super flyweight at the end of 2022.\n\nThere were others who weren't part of this royal quartet but who nevertheless deserved attention and acclaim.\n\nNaoya Inoue had a three-year world title run from the end of 2014 through 2017. Sadly, the timing didn't align right for fights with the rest. Chocolatito joined the division at the tail end of 2016 with a win over Cuadras and had his two fights with Sor Rungvisai in 2017, losing one controversially and the other brutally. Estrada arrived at 115 himself at the start of 2017 and took on Cuadras later that year. By 2018, Inoue had moved up to bantamweight to begin his great run there.\n\nKazuto Ioka and Donnie Nietes entered the super flyweight ranks in 2018 after successful runs in the lower weight classes. Ioka and Nietes fought twice, Nietes winning the first by split decision in 2018 and Ioka avenging that with a unanimous decision win in 2022. Their paths otherwise never converged with the Four Kings. Nietes hasn't fought in two years, is now 42 years old and teased a comeback earlier this year. Ioka is not only still around, but he remains relevant and continues to defend his title, including a unanimous decision win about a year ago against Joshua Franco, a former titleholder who happens to be Rodriguez's older brother.\n\nLet's pause on that for a moment -- we'll return to Ioka in just a couple of sentences.\n\nThat's because this Saturday's fight between Estrada and Rodriguez is the start of a beautiful three-week period. Over the span of 21 days, all four world titles are on the line at super flyweight.\n\nEstrada vs. Rodriguez is for the WBC belt and Estrada's lineal championship, earned with his 2019 win over Sor Rungvisai. On July 7, Ioka (WBA) will face fellow titleholder Fernando Daniel Martinez (IBF) in a unification bout. And on July 20, Kosei Tanaka will defend his WBO belt against Jonathan Rodriguez, who fell short in his previous title challenge, against Jerwin Ancajas, back in 2021.\n\nOh, and Chocolatito is returning July 12, fighting for the first time since that third Estrada match. He'll headline in his hometown of Managua, Nicaragua, against a former junior flyweight and flyweight contender named Rober Barrera.\n\nGonzalez vs. Barrera is up at bantamweight. If Chocolatito wins, he could remain at 118 and face any of the four titleholders there. All four are from Japan, a country that has been like a second home to Chocolatito; he's fought there 10 times over the course of his career. However, if Chocolatito is willing and able, he could also remain in the mix at 115, or any of these super flyweights might also be willing to move up three pounds to take on the living legend.\n\nThe second tier of the super flyweight division includes Pedro Guevara, a former 108-pound titleholder who just beat Andrew Moloney by split decision last month. David Jimenez, a former flyweight contender, scored a big win over fellow contender John \"Scrappy\" Ramirez in April on the undercard of Devin Haney vs. Ryan Garcia. Cuadras remains in the picture, given his November split decision victory over Guevara. Sor Rungvisai has fought a series of no-hopers since getting stopped two years ago.\n\nThe person who did that to Sor Rungvisai? Bam Rodriguez.\n\nThat was part of the run that established Rodriguez, when he went from prospect straight into the spotlight, seizing an unexpected opportunity. In February 2022, Cuadras and Sor Rungvisai were supposed to fight in a rematch of their 2014 bout. Sor Rungvisai fell ill, however. Rodriguez was scheduled to appear on the undercard in a 108-pound match. Instead, he moved up two weight classes to fight for the vacant WBC title, putting forth an impressive performance and taking a unanimous decision over Cuadras.\n\nIt was reminiscent of when Terence Crawford stepped in as a late replacement opponent himself, dominating Breidis Prescott in March 2013 and reaping the rewards. For Rodriguez, the win over Cuadras led to an eighth-round technical knockout of Sor Rungvisai in June 2022.\n\nLess than three months later, Rodriguez had a tougher time in his unanimous decision win over Israel Gonzalez -- who had come up short in his three past title fights against Ancajas, Khalid Yafai and Chocolatito -- but who remained (and still remains) a viable contender at 115.\n\nThe final month of 2022 brought Estrada-Chocolatito 3, which Estrada won by majority decision. Although Rodriguez had deposed two of the Four Kings in Cuadras and Sor Rungvisai, there would be no fight with the remaining two in 2023.\n\nInstead, Rodriguez moved down to flyweight and won a vacant world title, though he struggled with Cristian Gonzalez's movement and also had to fight through a broken jaw. After healing, Rodriguez returned last December with another impressive win, taking out fellow titleholder Sunny Edwards in nine rounds to unify two belts.\n\nNow Rodriguez is back at 115. Estrada is the perfect choice of opponent. For us, of course, but also for both of them.\n\n\"He's a legend of the sport. He's been around for many years. He's been around since I was an amateur. He was a champion when I was still an amateur. So to share the ring, it's an honor, but come June 29, I'm going to take over,\" Rodriguez said recently. \"I believe a win over Estrada will make me the face of the lower weight divisions. From what I've already accomplished, I'm like one fight away. This fight would seal the deal.\"\n\nEstrada has the advantages of experience, both in terms of time in the sport -- he's been a pro for 16 years while Rodriguez has been in the paid ranks for seven -- and the level of opposition faced. But there's also the combination of wear and tear from time, training and tough fights, plus the potential consequences of the long layoff. Will that rest lead to rust? Or will it turn out to be more helpful than harmful?\n\n\"Everybody is saying that I'm about to retire. But I actually consider that, at my 34 years of age, I have about four years left in my career,\" Estrada said. \"So the truth is that I think a lot of people are wrong.\"\n\nAs for the time away:\n\n\"It's been a year and a half since my last fight, but I haven't been out of the gym. I've actually been training,\" he said. \"Although I have not fought in this period, it's been good for me because [...] I like to be with my family, I like to be with my children. So I don't think I've been wasting time.\"\n\nRodriguez, meanwhile, is younger and fresher at 24 years old. His body hasn't been put through as much. Then again, he had those tougher outings against Israel Gonzalez and Cristian Gonzalez. That's something Estada felt worth mentioning.\n\n\"He's been a super flyweight champion before, but he didn't look very good and had to move down to flyweight, and I'm a fighter who made my debut at bantamweight and I've been moving down. I'm more used to these divisions than he is. And maybe he will feel [the punches] a little bit more. I consider myself to be a very complete boxer. I can go out. I can pressure. I can brawl. I don't think Bam is going to have it easy.\"\n\nEstrada indeed started off moving up and down between flyweight and bantamweight before going to 108 to face Chocolatito. And he's indeed been at 115 much longer. But just because Rodriguez was lighter doesn't mean he should be taken lightly. Estrada does acknowledge Rodriguez's quality -- \"Bam Rodriguez will be a test for me\" -- but he also inserted caveats in Rodriguez's performances, be they Estrada's legitimate beliefs or a form of mind games:\n\n\"Bam has been a good fighter,\" he said at one point. \"But a lot has to do with how his rivals have performed. Maybe they were not doing well and that's why he looks extraordinary.\"\n\n\"I was there at [Rodriguez's fight with Edwards] and he looked great, spectacular,\" he said at another point. \"He knocked out Edwards very good. But then again, Edwards is a flyweight. It's a different story in super flyweight.\"\n\nRodriguez, meanwhile, counters that the verdict is already in about how good he is, and that this match with Estrada will remove any lingering question marks. (His team also did something wise: setting up sparring with Chocolatito to give Rodriguez more high-level experience and perhaps an extra boost of confidence.)\n\n\"I just proved to everybody that I'm the real deal,\" Rodriguez said, referring to his wins in 2022 and 2023. \"People still to this day doubt me. They say that I've been in with washed-up fighters. But this is a fight where I can prove that I'm the real deal.\"\n\nAnd then, pending a contractual rematch clause being exercised, the winner can keep moving forward.\n\n\"I've been writing my legacy,\" Estrada said. \"And I want to keep making history.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be fighting for a long time, so I want to get big fights and give entertaining fights to the fans, just be pure entertainment,\" Rodriguez said. \"Seeing all the fighters that have become undisputed in the last few years, holding all the belts in the ring, it's very motivating to me. To be undisputed at 115 pounds would be a great accomplishment.\"\n\nThe reality of this fight is already plenty exciting. Thoughts of the bouts that could follow make this match even more enticing.\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that the seismographs are shaking, that the anticipation is growing.", "source": {"uri":

The bout felt like a passing of the torch, with the 24-year-old showcasing his prowess throughout the event and ended the fight with a brutal bodyshot.\n\nRodriguez expressed his admiration for Estrada, sharing that he idolized him as an amateur and considered it an honor to fight him for a title. This bout marked Rodriguez's first return to the super flyweight category since September 17, 2022, when he won the WBC World Super Flyweight title.

Aburime wrote in enthusiastic praise of Soludo saying among other things: \u201cIn the academic sphere, economic world, and Nigeria\u2019s vibrant socio-political landscape, the name Chukwuma Charles Soludo, CFR, continues to shine with unparalleled brilliance. As the incumbent Governor of Anambra State, Prof. Soludo\u2019s extraordinary achievements have once again been recognised on a national stage. \u201cNewly honoured with the \u201cGovernor of the Year in Infrastructure and Rural Development\u201d at the 2023 Champion Annual Awards by Champion Newspapers, Prof. Soludo\u2019s acceptance of this accolade is a further authentication of his tireless obligation to game-changing leadership and sustainable development\u201d. Aburime said Soludo\u2019s journey is a compelling narrative of academic excellence and relentless service. \u201cHis academic prowess was evident from his days at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he graduated with First Class Honors in Economics, bagging numerous departmental, faculty, and university prizes. This was followed by an impressive array of short- and medium-term courses and fellowships at world-renowned institutions like Cambridge, Oxford, and Warwick, as well as significant stints at the Brookings Institution and the United Nations\u201d. He said that nationally and internationally, Soludo\u2019s career as an itinerant scholar and consultant has seen him traverse 45 countries, providing his insights to 21 financial and developmental institutions, including the World Bank, IMF, and African Development Bank. In 2003, he wrote, Soludo was summoned to serve Nigeria as Chief Economic Adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo and Deputy Chairman/CEO of the National Planning Commission. His tenure as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Aburime is particularly noteworthy. Under his stewardship, he wrote, the Nigerian banking sector witnessed an unprecedented transformation through the famed banking consolidation initiative, the effects of which are still felt today. Since assuming office as Governor of Anambra State on March 17, 2022, after a resounding electoral victory, Aburime continued, Prof. Soludo has embarked on a mission to redefine governance and development. \u201cThe foundation of his administration is anchored on Anambra\u2019s 50-Year Development Plan, which he played a pivotal role in crafting, and the People\u2019s Manifesto, famously known as the \u201cSoludo Solution.\u201d Under his leadership, Anambra State has seen a dynamic focus on five critical pillars: Security, Law and Order; Infrastructure and Economic Transformation; Human Capital Development and Social Agenda; Governance and Value System; and Environment and Urban Regeneration. This holistic approach has already yielded impressive results across these domains. \u201cThe state\u2019s infrastructure, especially in rural areas, has been revitalised, enhancing connectivity and stimulating economic activities. \u201cDespite inheriting lean financial resources, Soludo\u2019s administration has demonstrated remarkable fiscal prudence. Eschewing the temptation to borrow despite having legislative approval to do so, he has steered Anambra to be ranked among the top five states in fiscal sustainability by BudGit, a proof of his intuitive and pragmatic approach to public finance management. \u201cThe recognition of Prof. Soludo as the \u201cGovernor of the Year in Infrastructure and Rural Development\u201d is a fitting tribute to his relentless drive to uplift Anambra State\u201d, he added# Photo: Mr. Aburime", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"572\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0029.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0029.jpg 572w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0029-300x176.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0029-357x210.jpg 357w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" /></div>The Press Secretary to Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State, Mr. Christian Aburime has praised his principal to high heavens after he was honoured with \u201cGovernor of the Year in Infrastructure and Rural Development\u201d at the 2023 Champion Annual Awards.&#160; Aburime wrote in enthusiastic praise of Soludo saying among other things: &#8220;In the academic [&#8230;]", "url": "https://independent.ng/aide-showers-encomiun-as-soludos-honoured-with-champion-newspapers-award/", "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0029.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:47:58", "author": "Shojobi Abisola", "authors": ["Shojobi Abisola"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.645}

(Yu Nakajima/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nTokyo. Hiroshima officials urged world leaders Tuesday to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and rising tensions in East Asia.\n\nThey commented as Hiroshima remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II.\n\nThe memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" which includes atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. That is a shift from Japan's past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence \"deliberately ignore ... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.\"\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival,\" he said.\n\nHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict between Israel and Palestinians are \"deepening distrust and fear among nations\" and reinforcing a view that the use of force in settling conflict is unavoidable.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroyed the city, killing 140,000 people. A second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan's nearly half-century aggression in Asia.\n\nAbout 50,000 people at the ceremony observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a U.S. B-29 dropped the bomb on the city. Hundreds of white doves, considered symbols of peace, were released.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, who attended the ceremony, said global conflicts and divided views over approaches to nuclear disarmament make achieving that goal \"all the more challenging,\" but pledged to do his utmost in pursuing \"realistic and practical measures\" to build momentum within the international community.\n\nHis critics say it is a hollow promise because Japan relies on the US nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military.\n\nJapan, the United States and other regional allies have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. Japan has sought stronger US protection by its nuclear capability.\n\nMany survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.\n\nAs of March, 106,823 survivors -- 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.58 -- are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive \"black rain\" that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.\n\nHiroshima officials called on Kishida's government to do more to provide support and address their wishes.\n\nThe aging survivors, known as \"hibakusha,\" continue to push for a nuclear arms ban as they desperately campaign to have their efforts kept alive by younger generations.\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima marked a turning point in World War II, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of its occupation of territories like Indonesia. Just days after Japan's surrender, Indonesia declared its independence on Aug. 17, 1945.

nuclear disarmament must be tackled as pressing issue | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Hiroshima officials have urged world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment to remove the risk of atomic war amid conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and rising tensions in East Asia.\n\nThey commented on Tuesday as Hiroshima remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War Two.\n\nThe memorial comes days after Japan and the US reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence\", which includes atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally.\n\nIt marks a shift from Japan's past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Governor Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence \"deliberately ignore... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.\"\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Mr Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival.\"\n\nHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict between Israel and Palestinians are \"deepening distrust and fear among nations\" and reinforcing a view that use of force in settling conflict is unavoidable.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, destroyed the city, killing 140,000 people.\n\nA second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more.\n\nJapan surrendered on August 15, ending World War Two and Japan's nearly half-century aggression in Asia.\n\nAbout 50,000 people at the ceremony observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8.15 am, the time when a US B-29 dropped the bomb on the city.\n\nHundreds of white doves, considered symbols of peace, were released.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, who attended the ceremony, said global conflicts and divided views over approaches to nuclear disarmament make achieving that goal \"all the more challenging,\" but pledged to do his utmost in pursuing \"realistic and practical measures\" to build momentum within the international community.\n\nHis critics say it is a hollow promise because Japan relies on the US nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military.\n\nJapan, the US and other regional allies have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea.\n\nJapan has sought stronger US protection by its nuclear capability.\n\nMany survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.\n\nAs of March, 106,823 survivors -- 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.58 -- are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.\n\nMany others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive \"black rain\" that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.\n\nHiroshima officials called on Kishida's government to do more to provide support and address their wishes.\n\nThe aging survivors, known as \"hibakusha,\" continue to push for a nuclear arms ban as they desperately campaign to have their effort kept alive by younger generations.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory",

That is a shift from Japan's past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence \"deliberately ignore ... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.\"\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival,\" he said.\n\nHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict between Israel and Palestinians are \"deepening distrust and fear among nations\" and reinforcing a view that use of force in settling conflict is unavoidable.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroyed the city, killing 140,000 people. A second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan's nearly half-century aggression in Asia.\n\nAbout 50,000 people at the ceremony observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a U.S. B-29 dropped the bomb on the city. Hundreds of white doves, considered symbols of peace, were released.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, who attended the ceremony, said global conflicts and divided views over approaches to nuclear disarmament make achieving that goal \"all the more challenging,\" but pledged to do his utmost in pursuing \"realistic and practical measures\" to build momentum within the international community.\n\nHis critics say it is a hollow promise because Japan relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military.\n\nJapan, the United States and other regional allies have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. Japan has sought stronger U.S. protection by its nuclear capability.\n\nMany survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.\n\nAs of March, 106,823 survivors -- 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.58 -- are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive \"black rain\" that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.\n\nHiroshima officials called on Kishida's government to do more to provide support and address their wishes.\n\nThe aging survivors, known as \"hibakusha,\" continue to push for a nuclear

On this day, conversations with Hibakusha, who share their personal stories of survival and resilience, provide invaluable insights into the human capacity for endurance and forgiveness while emphasising the importance of remembering history to avoid repeating it.\n\nEvery year, August 6 is observed solemnly as Hiroshima Day around the world and this year will be the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city in the final year of World War II.\n\nOn this day in 1945, the United States dropped the very first deployed nuclear bomb in the city of Hiroshima, wiping out an estimated 39 percent of the population, most of who were civilians. The Manhattan Project, commissioned by the US, created two atomic bombs where the first one, called 'The Little Boy' was dropped in the city of Hiroshima on August 6 and the moment an American B-29 bomber dropped it on the city, an estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people were killed instantly, while thousands more were hit with generational defects that are plaguing a section of the populace to this day.\n\nAs the sun sets on Hiroshima Day, visitors leave with a renewed sense of purpose. The experiences and lessons from Hiroshima inspire a commitment to peace and a determination to advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons. In honoring the past, we carry forward the legacy of Hiroshima, striving to build a future where such tragedies never occur again.\n\nHiroshima Day commemorates the 1945 tragedy which completely destroyed the city and left the country to deal with a dreadful fate even in its aftermath. It reminds the world that all wars are terrible and nuclear warfare even more so while reminding thousands of politicians, diplomats and envoys around the world that diplomacy is the only option to navigate geopolitics in the 21st century because only nine countries in the entire world currently possess more than 13,000 nuclear weapons.\n\nA visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is an essential part of the Hiroshima Day experience as it documents the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. Its park is the centerpiece of the day's activities where people gather during a ceremony to honour the victims and pledge to work towards a world free of nuclear weapons, followed by the release of doves and the tolling of the Peace Bell to create a solemn yet hopeful atmosphere, reinforcing the message of peace.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/MixCollage-05-Aug-2024-06-08-PM-4021_1722860900173_1722860927816.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 550, "textEnd": 558, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

In addition to being a day of remembrance for the lives lost, it's also a time to reflect on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear warfare.\n\nHighlighting the importance of peace, disarmament, and international cooperation, here is all you need to know about Hiroshima Day, what happened in history, and the significance behind marking this day.\n\nHiroshima Day 2024: Date and Origin\n\nHiroshima Day, observed annually on August 6, marks the tragic anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, by the United States during World War II in 1945. This year, in 2024, it will fall on a Tuesday.\n\nMarking the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, by the United States during World War II, the bombing, conducted by the B-29 bomber Enola Gay, nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" exploded approximately 600 meters above Hiroshima, unleashing an intense blast wave, searing heat, and deadly radiation.\n\nIt instantly killed approximately 70,000-80,000 people, with tens of thousands more succumbing to injuries and radiation exposure, the city's infrastructure decimated, and survivors, known as Hibakusha, faced long-term health issues and severe psychological trauma.\n\nOn August 9, 1945, the U.S. dropped a second atomic bomb, \"Fat Man,\" on Nagasaki. This event marked the first use of nuclear weapons in warfare and led to Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, effectively ending World War II.\n\nHiroshima Day 2024: Significance\n\nHiroshima Day is marked by ceremonies and events to remember the victims and promote peace and nuclear disarmament, serving as a crucial educational opportunity to raise awareness about the devastating consequences of nuclear warfare.\n\nThis year, the theme for Hiroshima Day 2024 will be \"Together with the Hibakusha, let us achieve a nuclear weapon-free, peaceful, and just world -- for the future of humankind and our planet.\".\n\nIt fosters a global dialogue on the ethical and moral implications of using such weapons, advocating for the necessity of peace and conflict resolution, and inspiring collective reflection and action towards a future free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nEvents held on Hiroshima Day, such as peace marches, educational seminars, and memorial services, engage communities worldwide in a shared commitment to nuclear disarmament and the promotion of global peace.\n\nThrough these activities, Hiroshima Day reinforces the importance of remembering the past to build a safer and more just world for future generations.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That is a shift from Japan's past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence \"deliberately ignore ... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.\"\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival,\" he said.\n\nHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict between Israel and Palestinians are \"deepening distrust and fear among nations\" and reinforcing a view that use of force in settling conflict is unavoidable.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroyed the city, killing 140,000 people. A second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan's nearly half-century aggression in Asia.\n\nAbout 50,000 people at the ceremony observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a U.S. B-29 dropped the bomb on the city. Hundreds of white doves, considered symbols of peace, were released.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, who attended the ceremony, said global conflicts and divided views over approaches to nuclear disarmament make achieving that goal \"all the more challenging,\" but pledged to do his utmost in pursuing \"realistic and practical measures\" to build momentum within the international community.\n\nHis critics say it is a hollow promise because Japan relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military.\n\nJapan, the United States and other regional allies have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. Japan has sought stronger U.S. protection by its nuclear capability.\n\nMany survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.\n\nAs of March, 106,823 survivors -- 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.58 -- are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive \"black rain\" that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.\n\nHiroshima officials called on Kishida's government to do more to provide support and address their wishes.\n\nThe aging survivors, known as \"hibakusha,\" continue to push for a nuclear arms ban as they desperately campaign to have their effort kept alive by younger generations.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Reports inform that many died later from radiation exposure and injuries.\n\nAccording to historical records, the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima at about 8:15 AM on August 6, 1945. The bomb was named Little Boy. The bomb was dropped by American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, named Enola Gay.\n\nHiroshima Day 2024 is marked on August 6.\n\nOn August 6 and August 9, 1945, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombings killed between 1,50,000 and 2,46,000 people respectively, most of whom were civilians. Following this tragedy, Japan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan and the invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war.\n\nHiroshima Day serves as a time to reflect on the adversities that humans face at the cost of war and violence. The annual event encourages dialogue aimed at achieving global peace and fostering international relations. On this day, workshops and seminars are held to educate people about the history and consequences of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe day aims to raise awareness about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the importance of working towards a world free of nuclear threats. The day emphasises the importance of peace and the need to prevent the use of nuclear weapons in the future.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrender of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enola Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet invasion of Manchuria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese Instrument of Surrender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/21-73-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 1282, "textEnd": 1293}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 64, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1065, "textEnd": 1074}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Hiroshima Day, observed every August, commemorates the devastating World War II event in 1945 when an atomic bomb was dropped on the city, causing immense destruction and loss of life. This day includes dialogues with Hibakusha, survivors who share their stories of endurance and forgiveness, emphasizing the importance of remembering history to prevent its repetition.\n\nDate\n\nHiroshima Day is solemnly observed on August 6 each year. In 2024, it marks the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during the final year of World War II.\n\nHistory\n\nOn August 6, 1945, the United States deployed the first nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, annihilating approximately 39% of its population, mostly civilians. The Manhattan Project, initiated by the US, produced two atomic bombs. The first, \"Little Boy,\" was dropped on Hiroshima by an American B-29 bomber, instantly killing an estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people and causing generational health issues still affecting some survivors today.\n\nSignificance\n\nHiroshima Day serves as a reminder of the catastrophic consequences of war, particularly nuclear warfare. The day underscores the importance of diplomacy in resolving geopolitical conflicts, given that only nine countries possess over 13,000 nuclear weapons. It is a call to action for global leaders to pursue peaceful solutions and prevent such tragedies from recurring.\n\nObservance\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, documenting the atomic bombing, is a focal point of Hiroshima Day. Activities center around its park, where a ceremony honours the victims and renews commitments to a nuclear-free world. The release of doves and the tolling of the Peace Bell create a solemn yet hopeful atmosphere, reinforcing the message of peace.\n\nAs the day concludes, visitors are inspired by the lessons of Hiroshima to advocate for a world without nuclear weapons, ensuring such horrors are never repeated.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "askari_jaffer@thehansindia.com", "name": "Askari Jaffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-free_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear-free zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/08/06/1468549-hiroshima-day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 631, "textEnd": 639}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

That is a shift from Japan\u00b4s past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world\u00b4s only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence \"deliberately ignore ... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.\"\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTS TO 79TH NOT 78TH - A man places incense in front of the cenotaph dedicated to the victims of the atomic bombing, early in the morning before an annual ceremony marking the 79th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, western Japan, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024.

A second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan\u00b4s nearly half-century aggression in Asia.\n\nAbout 50,000 people at the ceremony observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a U.S. B-29 dropped the bomb on the city. Hundreds of white doves, considered symbols of peace, were released.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, who attended the ceremony, said global conflicts and divided views over approaches to nuclear disarmament make achieving that goal \"all the more challenging,\" but pledged to do his utmost in pursuing \"realistic and practical measures\" to build momentum within the international community.\n\nHis critics say it is a hollow promise because Japan relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military.\n\nJapan, the United States and other regional allies have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea. Japan has sought stronger U.S. protection by its nuclear capability.\n\nMany survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.\n\nAs of March, 106,823 survivors - 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.58 - are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive \"black rain\" that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.\n\nHiroshima officials called on Kishida\u00b4s government to do more to provide support and address their wishes.\n\nThe aging survivors, known as \"hibakusha,\" continue to push for a nuclear arms ban as they desperately campaign to have their effort kept alive by younger generations.\n\nDoves fly over the cenotaph dedicated to the victims of the atomic bombing during an annual ceremony marking the 79th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing, at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, western Japan, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024.

The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians.\n\nHiroshima commemorated the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing that destroyed most of the city.\n\nResidents of Japan today observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima carried out by the United States 79 years ago.\n\nThe main memorial ceremony on the anniversary of the tragedy was held in the Peace Memorial Park in the center of Hiroshima. The minute of silence was announced throughout the country at 08:15 local time - the moment the bomb exploded on August 6, 1945.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony to mark the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui did not mention the fact that the 1945 bombings were carried out by the US.\n\nIn their public speeches, Japanese officials usually do not stress that it was the United States that bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In previous years, Japanese prime ministers and mayors of the two cities did not directly name the United States in their speeches at memorial ceremonies to mark the anniversaries.\n\nHowever, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum presents all the details of the 1945 atomic bombings. Their history is also comprehensively reflected in textbooks for schools and universities in Japan.\n\nThe United States has committed more crimes than any other country in history, and unfortunately, even though the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States never changed its policies toward other nations.\n\nAlthough the anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is a reminder of America's great crime against humanity, the people of the world today can witness the amount of destruction and killings that take place on a daily basis with the use of American weapons.\n\nNearly a year into the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins after being targeted by the ammunition the US provided to the regime of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip on Monday announced that the occupying regime of Israel has committed 3 more massacres against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe number of Palestinians martyred and wounded in Israeli attacks against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of war on October 07, 2023, has increased by 39,653 and 91,535 respectively, according to the latest statistics.\n\nIn a tweet in 2022 and on the occasion of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the US, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said, \"In August 1945, the United States instantly killed 100,000 people with an atomic bomb in the city of Hiroshima!\"\n\n\"This is the nature of an arrogant, irreligious, atheistic, and immoral army.\"\n\n\"If one wants to talk about the crimes of the armies of the arrogant powers, several books can and should be written.\"\n\nReported by Mohaddeseh Pakravan", "source": {"uri":

The memorial comes days after Japan and the US reaffirmed Washington's commitment to extended deterrence, which includes atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. That is a shift from Japan's past reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nHiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence deliberately ignore ... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception. As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday, Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\nNuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival, he said.\n\nHiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict between Israel and Palestinians are deepening distrust and fear among nations and reinforcing a view that the use of force in settling the conflict is unavoidable.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, destroyed the city, killing 140,000 people.

This tragic bombing resulted in massive destruction, killing tens of thousands of people instantly and causing long-term suffering for many more due to injuries and radiation.\n\nHiroshima Day is a time to remember those who lost their lives and to reflect on the terrible impact of nuclear warfare. Through education, advocacy, and collective action, we can work towards a future where the horrors of Hiroshima are never repeated.\n\nPurpose of the day:\n\nThis day aims to educate people about the immense harm caused by nuclear weapons. It also serves as a tribute to the lives lost and the survivors who endured immense suffering.\n\nKey Activities on 6th August, 2024:\n\nKey events on Hiroshima Day 2024 include the Peace Memorial Ceremony in Hiroshima, peace vigils, commemorative events, educational programs, exhibitions, and campaigns promoting nuclear disarmament and peacebuilding.\n\nSignificance of Hiroshima Day:\n\nHiroshima Day is an important political, moral, and historical occasion. It acts as a platform for advocating peace and disarmament as well as a day of remembrance for the victims.\n\nHonoring and Lamenting:\n\nOn Hiroshima Day, people around the world pause to remember the lives lost and the suffering endured by the hibakusha. Events and ceremonies, such as the Peace Memorial Ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, take place in Hiroshima and other cities. To represent peace and hope, participants offer prayers, hold silent moments, and release paper lanterns.\n\nAdvocacy for Nuclear Disarmament:\n\nAnother advocacy day is Hiroshima Day. It draws attention to how urgently nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are needed. On this occasion, groups, activists, and decision-makers advocate for international treaties and agreements that lessen the threat posed by nuclear weapons and call for their abolition.\n\nHiroshima Day's Effects: Increasing Awareness:\n\nRaising Awareness: Hiroshima Day serves to bring attention to the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons and the value of world peace. It reaches a large audience and stimulates critical thinking about nuclear issues through media coverage, public events, and educational initiatives.\n\nEncouragement of Disarmament and Peace:\n\nThe worldwide commitment to peace and disarmament is strengthened by this day. It brings together diverse groups, from grassroots activists to world leaders, in a united call for the elimination of nuclear weapons. This collective effort helps to maintain momentum for disarmament initiatives and treaties.\n\nHonouring the Victims:\n\nHiroshima Day is primarily a memorial to the bombing victims. It guarantees that their memories will be kept for future generations by acknowledging their suffering and resiliency. This memorial service promotes a feeling of humanity among all people and a dedication to averting similar tragedies in the future.\n\nThe Bombing of Hiroshima and Impact:\n\nOn the morning of August 6, 1945, at 8:15 AM, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb, code-named 'Little Boy', over Hiroshima. One second after the bomb struck on the city of Hiroshima, a huge fireball 280m in diameter erupted with a core temperature of more than 1,000,000 degrees Celsius. Heat rays from the explosion raised surface temperatures of everything in their path to more than 3,000 degrees Celsius - more than twice the melting point of iron.\n\nThis sudden and extreme rise in temperature rapidly expanded the air around it, generating a blast that travelled faster than the speed of sound. Then, a drop in air pressure in the space behind the blast caused a backdraft powerful enough to burst the eyeballs and internal organs of anyone in its path.\n\nThe bomb exploded with an unprecedented force, the estimated death toll from the initial blast, fires, and radiation exposure in the months and years that followed was approximately 140,000 people by the end of 1945.\n\nAlmost everyone within one kilometre of the hypocenter was killed instantly. Those further out were pelted with bits of the city's buildings, and badly burnt by the extreme heat, giving rise to the characteristic keloid scars - large overgrown tissue produced when the body creates too much collagen. The scar becomes larger than the initial wound.\n\nMost of the radiation generated by the blast took the form of gamma rays, but 10 per cent was made up of neutron waves. Both are types of ionising radiation that are capable of causing alterations to DNA, though neutrons are much more dangerous. Around 10 per cent of Little Boy's 64kg of uranium was eaten up by the initial fission reaction, leaving the remaining 90 per cent of the radioactive material to be strewn all over the city by the blast.\n\nHowever, just one month later, red canna flowers began to sprout less than 1km from the hypocentre. The impact on Hiroshima's infrastructure, economy, and population was profound and enduring. Many of the survivors suffered the symptoms of radiation sickness, which included vomiting, fever, fatigue, bleeding from the gums, thinning hair, diarrhoea, malnutrition and in the worst cases, death.\n\nLong-term effects:\n\nIt takes around 10 seconds for the fireball from a nuclear explosion to reach its maximum size, but the effects last for decades and span across generations. Two days after the bombing, Harold Jacobsen, the Manhattan Project physician, stated that nothing would grow in Hiroshima for 70 years.\n\nFive to six years after the bombings, the incidence of leukaemia increased noticeably among survivors. After about a decade, survivors began suffering from thyroid, leukaemia, breast, lung and other cancers at higher than normal rates. And for all survivors, cancers related to radiation exposure still continue to increase throughout their lifespan. Pregnant women exposed to the bombings experienced higher rates of miscarriage and deaths among their infants; their children were more likely to have intellectual disabilities, impaired growth and an increased risk of developing cancer.\n\nWhy did the US attack Hiroshima?\n\nDuring the Second World War Japan was against the United States America and its allies including Britain and the Soviet Union. The allies were winning the war and Japan was pushed back from several locations. During the fighting, several soldiers died every day and Japan had been at war for so many years.\n\nLater, Japan and China teamed up and attacked America. Japanese troops were treated very badly by Japanese soldiers. The then President of the US Harry S Truman wanted to surrender Japanese soldiers as quickly as possible and save lives. He permitted the nuclear bombing with the view that the Japanese would surrender after the destruction. The United States wanted to avoid the invasion of Japan through the land.\n\nAlso, some historians stated that the US also wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by the Soviet Union. So, America dropped a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nTreaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons:\n\nA number of multilateral treaties have since been established with the aim of preventing nuclear proliferation and testing, while promoting progress in nuclear disarmament. These include the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests In The Atmosphere, In Outer Space And Under Water, also known as the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was signed in 1996 but has yet to enter into force, and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).\n\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted by the Conference (by a vote of 122 States in favour, with one vote against and one abstention) at the United Nations on 7 July 2017, and opened for signature on 20 September 2017. Following the deposit with the Secretary-General of the 50th instrument of ratification or accession of the Treaty on 24 October 2020, it entered into force on 22 January 2021 in accordance with its article 15 (1).", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ionizing radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neutron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melting point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamma ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

This devastating event resulted in the deaths of approximately 140,000 people. Just three days later, another atomic bomb, 'Fat Man,' was dropped on Nagasaki, marking a pivotal moment in the war against imperial Japan.\n\nRemembering Hiroshima Day\n\nSeventy-nine years later, the world commemorates Hiroshima Day annually on August 6. This day serves as a solemn reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear warfare and calls for global unity in the pursuit of peace and disarmament. As we mark the 79th anniversary, let us delve into the history and significance of this day.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nIn the 1940s, Hiroshima was a major center of industrial and military activities in Japan, a member of the Axis powers alongside Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. The Axis coalition was engaged in a fierce conflict with the Allies, which included the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.\n\nDuring the war, Japan launched several aggressive attacks on US and British forces, aiming to seize control of their colonies and resources in Southeast Asia. Notably, on December 7 and 8, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and British-occupied Hong Kong, resulting in significant casualties and damage to the Allied fleets.\n\nThe Development of Atomic Bombs\n\nIn response, the United States initiated the Manhattan Project, a secret effort to develop atomic bomb technology under the leadership of nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer. The successful creation of the atomic bombs led to the deployment of 'Little Boy' on Hiroshima and 'Fat Man' on Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. These bombings ultimately forced Japan to surrender, bringing an end to World War II.\n\nThe Aftermath and Commemoration\n\nWhile Japan eventually recovered from the devastation of the atomic bombings, the threat of nuclear warfare continues to cast a long shadow. Hiroshima Day serves as a poignant plea for peace, urging world powers to avoid repeating such catastrophic mistakes. This day is observed with solemn remembrance and reflection, particularly at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan, which honours the victims and underscores the devastating effects of nuclear war.\n\nHiroshima Day is a time for the global community to reflect on the horrors of nuclear weapons and to recommit to the cause of peace and disarmament. By remembering the tragic events of August 6, 1945, we honour the victims and reinforce our collective resolve to prevent such tragedies in the future.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "askari_jaffer@thehansindia.com", "name": "Askari Jaffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axis powers"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empire of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Italy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attack on Pearl Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Monday of the clear and present danger of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons, and the threat of their use, are not confined to history books. They have once again appeared in the daily rhetoric of international relations,\" Guterres said in a message to mark the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima by the U.S..\n\n\"They represent a real and present danger that remains with us today,\" he added.\n\nThe Aug. 6, 1945 bombing of Hiroshima during World War II left an estimated 140,000 people dead by the end of the year, while an atomic bomb dropped on the city of Nagasaki three days later killed an estimated 74,000 people.\n\nThe two strikes led to the end of World War II, and to this day Japan remains the only country to be hit by atomic weapons in wartime.\n\n\"The lessons of Hiroshima, which once guided our collective efforts towards disarmament and peace, have been pushed aside,\" Guterres said.\n\nWhile \"some are recklessly rattling the nuclear saber once more,\" he stressed that the U.N. endeavors to keep alive the lessons of 1945.\n\nHe called on the world to stand together to condemn \"this unacceptable behavior\" and find new solutions to bring disarmament to life.\n\n\"We will never forget the lessons of 6 August 1945. No more Hiroshimas. No more Nagasakis,\" he added.\n\nThe mayor of Hiroshima also said Tuesday that wars in Ukraine and Gaza were deepening fear and distrust worldwide.\n\nKazumi Matsui made a somber speech at a memorial event to commemorate the victims of the U.S. nuclear attack.\n\n\"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nDuring Tuesday's ceremony, dignitaries including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida -- all clad in black suits -- bowed deeply and laid wreaths at the memorial cenotaph featuring the inscription \"rest in peace\".\n\nToday, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million people, but the ruins of a domed building stand in the city center as a stark reminder of the attack's horrors.\n\nFor the third year running, Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt was the city's first peace memorial since Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza last year following an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on the country.\n\nThe Israeli ambassador attended the ceremony as usual, but according to local media, Hiroshima has never invited a Palestinian representative.\n\n\"That an invitation wasn't extended to Palestine is shocking\", the Permanent General Mission of Palestine to Japan said on social media platform X last month.\n\nA city official told AFP in June that Hiroshima had called for a \"ceasefire as soon as possible and resolution through dialogue\" in its invitation letter to Israel.\n\nIsrael's ambassador has not, however, been invited to the Nagasaki peace ceremony this year.\n\nNagasaki has said the decision was not politically motivated, but rather taken to avoid any unexpected trouble.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A reminder of the cataclysmic impact of nuclear weapons, this day calls for unity amongst all nations in pursuit of peace and disarmament. On the 79th anniversary of the day, let's take a look at the history and understand some key facts about it.\n\nHiroshima Day: History\n\nIn Japan, the city of Hiroshima used to be a major hub of industrial and military activities. At that time, Japan was a part of the Axis coalition, which also included the Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Altogether, the coalition was fighting against the Allies -- the United States, Britain, Soviet Union and China.\n\nDuring World War II, Japan carried out multiple attacks against the US and British forces in its bid to take control of the European and American colonies in Southeast Asia as well as their resources.\n\nAs part of it, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and British-occupied Hong Kong on December 7 and December 8, 1941. This resulted in multiple casualties, besides causing extensive damage to the US and British fleets.\n\nIn the meantime, the US secretly went on to develop the Atomic Bomb technology under the Manhattan Project. This project was led by nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer. After its success, the two major atom bombs -- 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man' -- were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan on August 6 and August 9, 1945. As a result, Japan surrendered and this led to the end of World War II.\n\nHiroshima Day: Significance\n\nWhile Japan did manage to recover from the nuclear attacks over some time, the shadow of a nuclear war continues to haunt the country. Every year, Hiroshima Day is marked as a plea for peace to all world powers to avoid repeating such mistakes. This is a day of solemn remembrance and reflection.\n\nIn the aftermath, Japan witnessed a series of human suffering that went on to leave an indelible scar in the annals of history. Observed at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan, this day highlights the effects of nuclear wars and pays tribute to the ones who were killed.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nibandh_vinod@news18.com", "name": "Nibandh Vinod", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empire of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Italy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thirteen Colonies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axis powers"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

This day marks the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. It is a time to remember the tragic events of that day, honour the victims, and promote peace and nuclear disarmament.\n\nHistory: August 6, 1945On August 6, 1945, during the final stages of World War II, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, to end the war as soon as possible.The bomb, called \"Little Boy,\" exploded at 8:15 AM, releasing a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT. The explosion caused immense destruction, levelling buildings and igniting fires across the city. Approximately 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed instantly, and by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to around 140,000 due to injuries and radiation sickness.The impactThe impact of the bombing on the people of Hiroshima was devastating. Survivors, known as Hibakusha, faced severe long-term health effects, including cancer and other illnesses caused by radiation exposure. Many lost their families, homes, and livelihoods. The psychological trauma and physical scars endured by the survivors serve as a stark reminder of the horrors of nuclear warfare.\n\nCommemorating Hiroshima DayHiroshima Day is observed with solemn ceremonies, especially in Hiroshima itself. One of the central events is held at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where the Peace Bell is rung, and people gather to offer prayers and observe moments of silence. Around the world, people also commemorate the day by participating in peace marches, educational programs, and other events aimed at promoting nuclear disarmament and global peace.\n\nThe significance of Hiroshima DayHiroshima Day is significant not only as a day of remembrance but also as a call to action. It underscores the importance of working towards a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons. Various international organizations and treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), strive to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament. The day serves as a reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear warfare and the urgent need to prevent such an event from ever happening again.\n\nMessages of peace and hopeOn Hiroshima Day, leaders, peace activists, and survivors share messages of peace, urging the world to learn from history and work towards a future without nuclear weapons.

Residents of Japan observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima carried out by the United States 79 years ago.\n\nThe main memorial ceremony on the anniversary of the tragedy was held in the Peace Memorial Park in the center of Hiroshima. The minute of silence was announced throughout the country at 08:15 local time (11:15 p.m. Moscow time) - the moment the bomb exploded on August 6, 1945.\n\nThe US Armed Forces carried out the first-ever atomic bombing in history, striking the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki toward the tail end of World War II. The bombings were justified as a way to accelerate the capitulation of the Empire of Japan. These attacks are the sole instance of nuclear weapons ever being used in a military conflict in the history of humanity.\n\nAccording to various estimates, the explosion of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima, in one day killed between 70,000 and 100,000 people. By the end of 1945, the number of victims had increased to 140,000 due to those who died in hospitals from wounds and radiation.\n\nEvery year this sad list is replenished when a survivor dies. Almost 5,000 new names have been added to this list over the past year. Besides that, the names of those people who died during the blast but whose death has not been confirmed until now are added to the list.

The Palestinian embassy also criticized Hiroshima for not inviting Palestine to the ceremony.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Izumi Nakamitsu, U.N. undersecretary general and high representative for disarmament affairs, read out a statement by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in which he noted, \"Since last year, global mistrust and division have only deepened... some are recklessly rattling the nuclear saber once more.\"\n\n\"The world must stand together to condemn this unacceptable behavior. And we must find new solutions to bring disarmament to life,\" the statement said.\n\nIn the declaration, the mayor also urged all world leaders to visit Hiroshima in the hope that they will \"gain a deeper understanding of the atomic bombing\" and \"issue a compelling call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nIn addition, Matsui in his speech lamented the failure of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference to adopt a final document for the second time in a row, saying the stalemate \"revealed a harsh reality, namely, the enormous differences among countries with respect to nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThree days after the bomb, nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" decimated Hiroshima, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered to the Allied forces six days later, marking the end of World War II.\n\nThe combined number of officially recognized survivors of the two nuclear attacks, known as hibakusha, stood at 106,825 as of March this year, down by 6,824 from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

The Palestinian embassy also criticized Hiroshima for not inviting Palestine to the ceremony.\n\nThree days after the bomb, nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" decimated Hiroshima, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered to the Allied forces six days later, marking the end of World War II.\n\nThe combined number of officially recognized survivors of the two nuclear attacks, known as hibakusha, stood at 106,825 as of March this year, down by 6,824 from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

It reduced the city to ashes and mercilessly deprived people of their dreams and bright futures. Even those who escaped death suffered hardships beyond description. As prime minister, I reverently express my sincere condolences to the souls who were victims of the atomic bomb here.\n\nI also extend my heartfelt sympathy to those still suffering even now from the aftereffects of the atomic bomb.\n\nThe devastation and human suffering wrought upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki 79 years ago must never be repeated. As the only country to have experienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war, Japan has the mission of firmly upholding the \"Three Non-Nuclear Principles\" and steadily building up efforts over time towards the realization of a world without nuclear weapons while conveying the realities of the atomic bombings to future generations.\n\nThe widening division within the international community over approaches to nuclear disarmament, Russia's nuclear threat, and other concerns make the situation surrounding nuclear disarmament all the more challenging. But no matter how arduous this path towards a world without nuclear weapons may be, we must continue moving forward along that path. In order to maintain and strengthen the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), we will press forward with realistic and practical measures under the Hiroshima Action Plan and lead the international community, with a view to building momentum within the international community for nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe world now stands at a critical point where the trend towards fewer nuclear weapons could undergo a reversal for the first time since the height of the Cold War. Promoting the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, or FMCT, is an important means of guarding against such a turn of events. In consonance with that, this year Japan launched a \"Friends of the FMCT\" framework that includes both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states. I myself will stand at the fore and be proactively involved in this work.\n\nIn May 2023, at the G7 Hiroshima Summit, I urged leaders and young people from all around the world to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the atomic bombings took place. Having them accurately understand the realities of the atomic bombings will be of great consequence as a starting point for all kinds of efforts towards nuclear disarmament.\n\nAs one part of these efforts, this past December, the Youth Leader Fund for a World Without Nuclear Weapons program, established by the United Nations through contributions from the Government of Japan, embarked on its activities. This year, through this program, the future leaders of both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states will visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWorking in tandem with atomic bomb survivors and others eager to bring about a world without nuclear weapons, Japan is determined to continue to do its utmost to pass down to the next generation messages from the atomic bomb survivors as well as the tragic realities of the atomic bombings.\n\nThe Government, accepting the necessity of relief measures covering health and medical services and welfare of atomic bomb survivors, will continue to advance relief measures in a comprehensive manner while staying in tune with atomic bomb survivors, who are advancing in years, including by conducting screenings for recognizing atomic bomb diseases as quickly as possible.\n\nIn closing, here in Hiroshima, where prayers for eternal peace are offered continuously, I pledge once again that Japan will make its utmost efforts for the realization of a world without nuclear weapons and for the realization of eternal peace. I wish to conclude with my heartfelt prayers for the repose of the souls of those who fell victim to the atomic bombing here in Hiroshima. I also pray sincerely for the inner peace of the bereaved families and the atomic bomb survivors as well as all the participants today and the people of Hiroshima City.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Non-Nuclear_Principles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Non-Nuclear Principles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_Material_Cut-off_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Particle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Particle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The city was devastated by a US nuclear bomb 79 years ago.\n\nThe governor of Hiroshima in Japan has made an impassioned plea to world leaders to get rid of nuclear weapons as the Japanese city marks the 79th anniversary of a nuclear attack that left around 140,000 people dead and caused massive devastation.\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Hidehiko Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future, \" he said. \"Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival.\"\n\nHiroshima's mayor, Kazumi Matsui, used his speech at the same event to highlight how current conflicts were normalizing the use of military force as a means to solve problems.\n\nMatsui said Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are \"claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life.\"\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nThe ceremony in Hiroshima was attended by some 50,000 people, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThey observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a US B-29 bomber dropped the bomb on the city.\n\nThe commemorative event comes just days after Japan and the US reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" which includes the possible use of atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally amid growing regional tensions.\n\nOpen discussion of nuclear deterrence in Japan is a radical shift away from the country's previous reluctance to touch on such issues as the only nation in the world to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, US forces detonated a nuclear bomb over the city in a bid to force Japan to surrender.\n\nIn addition to the tens of thousands of people who immediately died in the explosion, the attack left a terrible legacy in the many survivors of the bombings who had lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure.\n\nDays after the attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in southwest Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two attacks led to Japan's surrender on September 2.", "source":

Their population, which peaked at over 372,000, had fallen to 106,825 as of the end of March, with their average age exceeding 85, government data shows.\n\nEven smaller is the number of those who speak publicly about their experiences. In Hiroshima, their total stood at just 32 in April, according to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, making how to pass down their stories an increasingly pressing issue.\n\nTabimachi-Gate Hiroshima first operated the so-called peace tours in the summer of 2020 and introduced virtual reality headsets the following year.\n\nIt uses images created based on the lived experiences of Eizo Nomura, who was the only survivor of the bombing inside a building that features in the tour just 170 meters from ground-zero, as well as photographs and material that documented the blast. Forty-seven at the time, he died in 1982.\n\nThe images have been updated since the tour's launch based on feedback from survivors, some of whom said the reality was even worse than that portrayed. They now show the burned-out remnants of the city under a blood-red sky and specks of ash, as well as survivors with their blast injuries and the dead.\n\nBut the company is keen to distance itself from the label of \"dark tourism,\" which focuses on visits to places of death or tragedy, saying the tour also underscores a message of peace.\n\n\"We focused not just on the immediate effects of the atomic bomb but also on how the city has steadily built itself back up over the years,\" Masushige said.\n\nA version that omits people from the landscape is available for students, as well as for adults who would like to opt out of the more visceral imagery.\n\nFollowing the tour, participants gather at the Rest House, a former kimono store where Nomura survived, to reflect upon what they learned. One wall is covered with their post-it notes that wish for peace in multiple languages.\n\nSome of those are from hibakusha themselves who have taken the tour. \"A bright future for the children,\" one says.\n\n\"It's not something you can experience every day, so we hope it provides an opportunity to think deeply about peace,\" Masushige said.\n\nThe reservation-based tours cost 3,500 yen ($24) per adult and 1,000 yen for a child between the ages of 6 and 11.

But international developments, including nuclear threats from Russia in the war in Ukraine, have brought a broader awareness of the vulnerability to global peace from nuclear events.\n\nI've been studying the effects of nuclear events - from detonations to accidents - for over 30 years. This has included my direct involvement in research, teaching and humanitarian efforts in multiple expeditions to Chernobyl- and Fukushima-contaminated areas. Now I am involved in the proposal for the formation of a Nuclear Global Health Workforce, which I proposed in 2017.\n\nSuch a group could bring together nuclear and nonnuclear technical and health professionals for education and training, and help to meet the preparedness, coordination, collaboration and staffing requirements necessary to respond to a large-scale nuclear crisis.\n\nWhat would this workforce need to be prepared to manage? For that we can look back at the legacy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima.\n\nApproximately 135,000 and 64,000 people died, respectively, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The great majority of deaths happened in the first days after the bombings, mainly from thermal burns, severe physical injuries and radiation.\n\nThe great majority of doctors and nurses in Hiroshima were killed and injured, and therefore unable to assist in the response. This was largely due to the concentration of medical personnel and facilities in inner urban areas. This exact concentration exists today in the majority of American cities, and is a chilling reminder of the difficulty in medically responding to nuclear events.\n\nWhat if a nuclear device were detonated in an urban area today? I explored this issue in a 2007 study modeling a nuclear weapon attack on four American cities. As in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the majority of deaths would happen soon after the detonation, and the local health care response capability would be largely eradicated.\n\nModels show that such an event in an urban area in particular will not only destroy the existing public health protections but will, most likely, make it extremely difficult to respond, recover and rehabilitate them.\n\nVery few medical personnel today have the skills or knowledge to treat the kind and the quantity of injuries a nuclear blast can cause. Health care workers would have little to no familiarity with the treatment of radiation victims. Thermal burns would require enormous resources to treat even a single patient, and a large number of patients with these injuries will overwhelm any existing medical system. There would also be a massive number of laceration injuries from the breakage of virtually all glass in a wide area.\n\nA major nuclear event would create widespread panic, as large populations would fear the spread of radioactive materials, so evacuation or sheltering in place must be considered.\n\nFor instance, within a few weeks after the Chernobyl accident, more than 116,000 people were evacuated from the most contaminated areas of Ukraine and Belarus. Another 220,000 people were relocated in subsequent years.\n\nThe day after the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, over 200,000 people were evacuated from areas within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the nuclear plant because of the fear of the potential for radiation exposure.\n\nThe evacuation process in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Japan was plagued by misinformation, inadequate and confusing orders and delays in releasing information. There was also trouble evacuating everyone from the affected areas. Elderly and infirm residents were left in areas near radioactive contamination, and many others moved unnecessarily from uncontaminated areas (resulting in many deaths from winter conditions). All of these troubles lead to a loss of public trust in the government.\n\nHowever, an encouraging fact about nuclear fallout (and not generally known) is that the actual area that will receive dangerous levels of radioactive fallout is actually only a fraction of the total area in a circle around the detonation zone. For instance, in a hypothetical low-yield (10 kiloton) nuclear bomb over Washington, D.C., only limited evacuations are planned. Despite projections of 100,000 fatalities and about 150,000 casualties, the casualty-producing radiation plume would actually be expected to be confined to a relatively small area. (Using a clock-face analogy, the danger area would typically take up only a two-hour slot on the circle around the detonation, dictated by wind: for example, 2-4 o'clock.)\n\nPeople upwind would not need to take any action, and most of those downwind, in areas receiving relatively small radiation levels (from the point of view of being sufficient to cause radiation-related health issues), would need to seek only \"moderate shelter.\" That means basically staying indoors for a day or so or until emergency authorities give further instructions.\n\nThe Radiation Effects Research Foundation, which was established to study the effects of radiation on survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has been tracking the health effects of radiation for decades.\n\nAccording to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, about 1,900 excess cancer deaths can be attributed to the atomic bombs, with about 200 cases of leukemia and 1,700 solid cancers. Japan has constructed very detailed cancer screenings after Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Fukushima.\n\nBut the data on many potential health effects from radiation exposure, such as birth defects, are actually quite different from the prevailing public perception, which has been derived not from validated science education but from entertainment outlets (I teach a university course on the impact of media and popular culture on disaster knowledge).\n\nWhile it has been shown that intense medical X-ray exposure has accidentally produced birth defects in humans, there is doubt about whether there were birth defects in the descendants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Most respected long-term investigations have concluded there are no statistically significant increases in birth defects resulting in atomic bomb survivors.\n\nLooking at data from Chernobyl, where the release of airborne radiation was 100 times as much as Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, there is a lack of definitive data for radiation-induced birth defects.\n\nA wide-ranging WHO study concluded that there were no differences in rates of mental retardation and emotional problems in Chernobyl radiation-exposed children compared to children in control groups. A Harvard review on Chernobyl concluded that there was no substantive proof regarding radiation-induced effects on embryos or fetuses from the accident. Another study looked at the congenital abnormality registers for 16 European regions that received fallout from Chernobyl and concluded that the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of radiation exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified.\n\nIndeed, the most definitive Chernobyl health impact in terms of numbers was the dramatic increase of elective abortions near and at significant distances from the accident site.\n\nIn addition to rapid response and evacuation plans, a Nuclear Global Health Workforce could help health care practitioners, policymakers, administrators and others understand myths and realities of radiation. In the critical time just after a nuclear crisis, this would help officials make evidence-based policy decisions and help people understand the actual risks they face.\n\nToday, the risk of a nuclear exchange - and its devastating impact on medicine and public health worldwide - has only escalated compared to previous decades. Nine countries are known to have nuclear weapons, and international relations are increasingly volatile. The U.S. and Russia are heavily investing in the modernization of their nuclear stockpiles, and China, India and Pakistan are rapidly expanding the size and sophistication of their nuclear weapon capabilities. The developing technological sophistication among terrorist groups and the growing global availability and distribution of radioactive materials are also especially worrying.\n\nIn recent years, a number of government and private organizations have held meetings (all of which I attended) to devise large-scale medical responses to a nuclear weapon detonation in the U.S. and worldwide. They include the National Academy of Sciences, the National Alliance for Radiation Readiness, National Disaster Life Support Foundation, Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, and the Radiation Injury Treatment Network, which includes 74 hospitals nationwide actively preparing to receive radiation-exposed patients.\n\nDespite the gloomy prospects of health outcomes of any large-scale nuclear event common in the minds of many, there are a number of concrete steps the U.S. and other countries can take to prepare. It's our obligation to respond.\n\nThis article is an update to an article originally published in 2015 that includes links to more recent research and updated information on the threat of nuclear incidents. It was updated again in August 2022 to add a reference to nuclear threats related to war in Ukraine.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Men, women, children and the elderly are being shot through with bullets or blown to pieces by missiles,\" said the Hiroshima governor while the TV channels were showing the participation of Israeli ambassador at the event, according to an X user @horiris.\n\n- War on Gaza 'shattering normal life,\" says mayor\n\nWhile refusing to heed calls to withdraw Israeli officials from the \"peace event,\" Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui, however, said: \"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people, shattering normal life.\"\n\nHiroshima's invite to Israel has been slammed as double standards as Japan has refused to invite Russia and Belarus since Moscow launched its war on Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\n\nIt has not invited any representative from Palestinian Embassy either.\n\nAmbassador Waleed Siam, however, has been invited to virtually address an alternate peace event.\n\n\"It seems to me that these global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that, to solve international problems, we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting,\" he added.\n\nSince Japan was the only nation to be hit by nuclear bombing, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said it was Tokyo's \"duty\" to \"steadily work toward realizing a world without nuclear weapons.\"\n\nAccording to @kojiskojis social media user on X, some pro-Palestine protesters in Tokyo also held placards, urging boycott of the Israeli products.\n\nA \"die-in\" protest was also held outside Israeli Embassy in Tokyo, according to @mkimpo_kid.\n\nThe protest was held around the same time when moments of silence were observed in Hiroshima to commemorate the victims of US nuclear bombing.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

whether they constituted a war crime.\n\nAt 8am on Tuesday morning, the Lord Mayor of Cork, Green Party councillor Dan Boyle, will lay a wreath at the stone that was installed by Cork City Council in 1984 to the memory of the victims of the bombings.\n\nThe peace memorial is situated at the western end of the South Mall.\n\nMr Boyle noted that it was 40 years since the stone had been installed,

The United States used atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan on August 6 and 9, respectively, killing about 210,000 people. Hiroshima was founded as a castle town by the feudal lord M\u014dri Terumoto in the 16th century. The city was destroyed when an atomic bomb was dropped by a US aeroplane, resulting in a significant number of casualties and ongoing health issues due to radiation exposure. Let us know what happened on this day and its aftermath.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, Hiroshima, Japan, experienced an unprecedented flash of light as an atomic bomb exploded, causing widespread devastation and human suffering. The aftermath left an indelible mark on history, serving as a grim reminder of the catastrophic effects of nuclear warfare.\n\nAround 8.15 am on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb named \"Little Boy\" on the city of Hiroshima. The bomb was released by the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft called Enola Gay, piloted by Paul Tibbets. This devastating blast immediately caused the death of approximately 80,000 people and injured over 35,000.\n\nBefore the bombing, the United States had been warning Japanese civilians about potential air raids by dropping millions of leaflets across Japan. Still, no specific warning was given before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The bomb missed its intended target of Aioi Bridge due to a crosswind and instead detonated directly over Shima Surgical Clinic.\n\nThe destructive power of the bomb was immense, with the blast destroying about 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima, leaving only 28,000 standing.\n\nThe bomb released energy equivalent to 16 \u00b1 2 kilotons of TNT but was considered inefficient as it only fissioned 1.7 per cent of its material. Its destruction radius was about 1.6 kilometres, while fires engulfed approximately 11 square kilometres.\n\nThe Enola Gay stayed over the target area for two minutes and was 16 kilometres away when the bomb detonated.\n\nThe effect\n\nThe fireball reached its largest size, about 900 feet across, and the blast wave slowed to around the speed of sound - 768 miles per hour. The ground-level temperature under the blast was 7,000\u00b0 F, and the mushroom cloud began to form.\n\nThe blast wave spread fire outwards in all directions at 984 miles per hour, hitting the surrounding mountains of Hiroshima and bouncing back.\n\nThe strong wind and fire destroyed around 60,000 of the city's 90,000 buildings. About 525 feet southwest of the hypocentre, the copper covering on the Industrial Products Display Hall dome was missing, revealing a skeleton-like girder structure underneath. However, most of the building's brick and stonework remained intact.\n\nSlowly, the ground at the hypocentre cools to 5,400\u00b0F, but the mushroom cloud reaches a height of about 2,500 feet.\n\nThe fireball started to fade but remained very bright, about ten times the sun's brightness at a distance of 5.5 miles.\n\nNuclear shadows appeared for the first time due to the extreme heat radiation, outlining humans and objects that block the heat radiation.\n\nHiroshima was home to 280,000-290,000 civilians, as well as 43,000 soldiers at the time of the bombing.\n\nMore than 80,000 people were killed instantly or were seriously wounded. In four months following the explosion, 90,000 to 166,000 people were believed to have died from the bomb.\n\nThe US Department of Energy estimated that after five years, perhaps 200,000 or more fatalities occurred as a result of the bombing.\n\nHiroshima has estimated that 237,000 people were killed directly or indirectly by the bomb's effects, including burns, radiation sickness or cancer. Of the estimated 90,000 buildings, 62,000 were destroyed, including eliminating all utilities and means of transportation.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devika_kapoor@news9live.com", "name": "Devika Kapoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u014dri_Terumoto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u014dri Terumoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u014dkamachi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u014dkamachi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u014cta_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u014cta River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT equivalent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feudalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ionizing radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enola Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aioi_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aioi Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blast wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tibbets", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Tibbets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crosswind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mushroom cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteoroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic bombing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypocenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radius"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hiroshima-bombing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 247, "textEnd": 261}], "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

POOL\n\nThe mayor of Hiroshima said Tuesday that wars in Ukraine and Gaza were deepening fear and distrust worldwide, on the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing that devastated the Japanese city.\n\nKazumi Matsui made a sombre speech at a memorial event to commemorate the victims of the US nuclear attack on August 6, 1945 that left around 140,000 people dead.\n\n\"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nDays after the 1945 Hiroshima attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in southwest Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two strikes led to the end of World War II, and to this day Japan remains the only country to be hit by atomic weapons in wartime.\n\nDuring Tuesday's ceremony, dignitaries including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida -- all clad in black suits -- bowed deeply and laid wreaths at the memorial cenotaph featuring the inscription \"rest in peace\".\n\nToday, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million people, but the ruins of a domed building stand in the city centre as a stark reminder of the attack's horrors.\n\nFor the third year running, Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt was the city's first peace memorial since Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza last year following an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on the country.\n\nThe Israeli ambassador attended the ceremony as usual, but according to local media, Hiroshima has never invited a Palestinian representative.\n\n\"That an invitation wasn't extended to Palestine is shocking\", the Permanent General Mission of Palestine to Japan said on social media platform X last month.\n\nA city official told AFP in June that Hiroshima had called for a \"ceasefire as soon as possible and resolution through dialogue\" in its invitation letter to Israel.\n\nIsrael's ambassador has not, however, been invited to the Nagasaki peace ceremony this year.\n\nNagasaki has said the decision was not politically motivated, but rather taken to avoid any unexpected trouble.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence

Few, if any, buildings withstood the blast. More than 100,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagaski died as the cities were bombed. Eventually the death toll rose to more than 200,000 accounting for those who died from radiation. The people who survived suffered from severe burns and varying degrees of radiation poisoning; the term hibakusha was coined for the thousands of survivors who experienced discrimination, birthing problems, and a slew of cancer diagnoses.\n\nAugust 6 is commemorated every year at Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima \"to console the souls of those lost to the atomic bombing, as well as pray for the realization of lasting world peace.\" The City of Hiroshima's website also notes that its mayor sends a message each year \"to every country in the world\" calling for the abolition of weapons of mass destruction. Nagasaki holds its annual ceremony on August 9, the day it was bombed. (Rahm Emanuel, former mayor of Chicago and current U.S. Ambassador to Japan, is expected to be at both ceremonies).\n\nLast year, conversation about the dropping of the atomic bomb resurfaced in the U.S. for the first time in decades thanks to the Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer. Critics of the film argued that the Japanese perspective of the tragedy, including the long-term suffering and loss it produced, remains crucially absent from U.S. culture.\n\nThis difference is particularly stark on the anniversary of the bombing, explained Yuki Miyamoto, a second-generation hibakusha and ethics professor at DePaul University. \"If you are not in Hiroshima, August 6 is just a regular day,\" Miyamoto said. \"But if you are in Hiroshima, it's very, very different than even the day before. The city regulates traffic, people come in from all over, it's very big.\"\n\nMost U.S. cities, including Chicago, don't host Hiroshima Day ceremonies, but grassroots peace organizations -- like Chicago Area Peace Action and the American Friends Service Committee -- will sometimes organize smaller events to fill in the gap. (Chicago Area Peace Action is forgoing an event this year to plan for the Democratic National Convention.)\n\nAlthough the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was built in 1949, former president Barack Obama was the first sitting U.S. president to visit the site. There, he delivered stirring remarks that didn't obfuscate the horror of what the U.S. had done, outlining a bold goal of nuclear disarmament -- ridding the world of cataclysmic weapons of mass destruction altogether.\n\n\"Among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear, and pursue a world without them,\" he said. \"We can chart a course that leads to the destruction of these stockpiles. We can stop the spread to new nations.\"\n\nDespite some stockpile cuts during his time in office, Obama continued funding nuclear weapons research. \"The big disappointment was [Obama] saying those things, but at the same time, he actually increased the budget for nuclear arms,\" Miyamoto said.\n\nToday the U.S. has a larger nuclear arms stockpile than the rest of the world, with only Russia coming close in number of warheads, according to the Arms Control Association. And even more are on the way thanks to recent advancements in nuclear research.\n\nIn 2022, the Department of Energy received credit for achieving nuclear fusion, emphasizing the potential of \"clean\" energy (the word clean appears more than a dozen times in the DOE press release), but most reporting missed that the experiment was done at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has the goal of meeting \"urgent national security needs by advancing nuclear weapons science and technology.\"\n\nThe conflicting statements and double standards of the U.S. government can also be seen in Japan's actions, Miyamoto said. She explained that the countries' governments have grown into fierce allies, with the U.S. stationing more soldiers in Japan than any other foreign nation.\n\nThe City of Hiroshima invited Israel's government to this year's ceremony (after weeks of deliberation, Nagasaki decided not to invite Israel, according to CNN) despite Israel having spent most of the past year bombing Palestinians. Japan has also taken a strong stance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, similar to the U.S.\n\nThese conflicts and nuclear arms are domestic issues first and foremost since testing and manufacturing can't always be done abroad, Miyamoto noted. And some regional economies in the U.S., like New Mexico, are shaped entirely by weapons research.\n\n\"In the northern part of New Mexico, the two big employers are either Los Alamos or Walmart.\" Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the first nuclear bomb was developed, still does weapons research today, Miyamoto said. Effectively, she explained, workers have the option of earning a fair wage but being exposed to potentially serious health risks or earning a minimum wage with far worse benefits.\n\n\"It's true that some people have made out pretty good,\" said Neal Resnikoff, a northwest Chicagoan who is a longtime self-described \"veteran of opposing U.S. aggression,\" referring to these manufacturers' continually soaring corporate profits. \"But that's at the expense of the working class here and other people abroad,\" he explained.\n\nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit that \"began by advocating for an end to the nuclear arms race and nuclear weapons abolition,\" estimates Chicago's annual contributions total more than $800 million in tax funding for nuclear weapons research, testing, and cleanup -- and that number may increase over the next five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe amount of money Chicagoans contribute to weapons testing and cleanup alone could fund the creation of over 26,000 public housing units in the city or thousands of jobs, the nonprofit National Priorities Project estimates.\n\nAs a Chicago Anti-War Coalition organizer, Resnikoff has attended August 6 remembrance events in Chicago for years; he focuses on peace and building awareness among Chicagoans at all of his protesting events.

Are more powerful nuclear forces necessary for national security? What about arms races, competing to maintain superiority over other nations? Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people, shattering normal life. It seems to me that these global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that, to solve international problems, we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting. Given such circumstances, how can nations offer safety and security to their people? Is that not impossible?\n\nThrough the pillars under the Peace Memorial Museum, we can see the Cenotaph for the A-bomb Victims. Anyone praying at the Cenotaph can look straight through it to the Atomic Bomb Dome. Peace Memorial Park, with these structures on its north-south axis, was built in accordance with the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law, enacted 75 years ago today. Built by the people of Hiroshima and many other seekers of peace, it has become a place to memorialize the victims and to think, talk, and make promises to each other about peace.\n\nIf, after the war, Japan had abandoned our Peace Constitution and focused on rebuilding our military, the city of peace Hiroshima is today would not exist. Standing here, we can all feel our predecessors' determination to eliminate the scourge of war, trusting in the justice and faith of peace-loving people around the world.\n\nExpressing that determination, one hibakusha continually communicated the spirit of Hiroshima. \"Now is the time to turn the tide of history, to get beyond the hatreds of the past, uniting beyond differences of race and nationality to turn distrust into trust, hatred into reconciliation, and conflict into harmony.\" This uplifting sentiment was written by a man who, as a 14-year-old boy, saw scenes from a living hell -- a baby with skin peeled down to red flesh next to its mother burned from head to toe, and a corpse with its guts strewn out on the dirt.\n\nIn 1989, a massive people's movement for democracy brought down the Berlin Wall, the predominant symbol of the Cold War. President Gorbachev expressed humanity's collective need for peace and his determination to stop the arms race, end nuclear terror, eradicate nuclear weapons, and relentlessly pursue political solutions to regional conflicts. He and U.S. President Reagan worked together through dialogue to bring the Cold War to an end, which led to the United States and the Soviet Union concluding the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. They demonstrated that policymakers can overcome even critical situations through resolute commitment to dialogue.\n\nLet us not be resigned to pessimism about the chaotic world situation. Instead, let us be as determined as our forebears, and, united as one, with hope in our hearts, take collective action. Our unity will move leaders now relying on nuclear deterrence to shift their policies. We could make that happen.\n\nTo extinguish the suspicion and doubt that create conflicts, civil society must foster a circle of trust through exchange and dialogue with consideration for others. We must spread beyond national borders the sense of safety we feel in our daily lives. The crucial step here is to share and empathize with the experiences and values of others through music, art, sports, and other interactions. Through such exchange, let us create a world in which we all share the Culture of Peace. In particular, I call on our youth, who will lead future generations, to visit Hiroshima and, taking to heart what they experience here, create a circle of friendship with people of all ages. I hope they will ponder what they can do now, and act together to expand their circle of hope. The city of Hiroshima, working with Mayors for Peace, which now has more than 8,400 member cities in 166 countries and regions, will actively support community endeavors to raise peace consciousness.\n\nLast fiscal year, approximately 1.98 million people from around the world visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. This record number is evidence of unprecedented interest in the atomic-bombed city and a rise in peace consciousness. My hope is that all world leaders will visit Hiroshima, experience the will of civil society, gain a deeper understanding of the atomic bombing, and hold in their hearts the hibakusha plea, \"No one should ever suffer as we have.\" Then, while they are here, I hope they will, with iron resolve, issue a compelling call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\nTwice in a row the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference has failed to adopt a final document. These failures have revealed a harsh reality, namely, the enormous differences among countries with respect to nuclear weapons. I hope the Japanese government, which has declared repeatedly that the NPT is the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, will exercise strong leadership, calling all countries to transcend their positions and engage in constructive dialogue toward a relationship of trust. Furthermore, I request that Japan, as a practical effort toward a nuclear-weapon-free world, participate as an observer at the Third Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to be held in March next year. Subsequently and as soon as possible, Japan must become a party to the treaty. In addition, I demand that the Japanese government strengthen measures of support for the hibakusha, including those living outside Japan. Now that their average age has exceeded 85, the government must accept that they are still suffering the many adverse emotional and physical effects of radiation.\n\nToday, at this Peace Memorial Ceremony marking 79 years since the bombing, we offer our deepest condolences to the souls of the atomic bomb victims. Together with Nagasaki and likeminded people around the world, remembering once again the hibakusha struggle, we pledge to make every effort to abolish nuclear weapons and light the way toward lasting world peace. Citizens of the world, let us all, with hope in our hearts, walk with Hiroshima toward tomorrow's peace.", "source": {"uri": "mainichi.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e"},

It begins at 8:00 (23:00 GMT on Monday) with the laying of lists of those killed in the atomic bombing and its consequences at the monument. This year, another 5,079 names were added to the list of 344,000. The Peace Park, where the ceremony is held annually, is located in the epicenter of the bombing on August 6, 1945 where the force of the bomb vaporized the bodies of its victims. In the park there is a mass grave in the form of a hill with a Buddhist pagoda on top, where the ashes of 70,000 unidentified victims of the tragedy rest. On the monument in the Peace Park, next to which the funeral ceremony is taking place, it is written: \"Sleep peacefully, this mistake will not be repeated again.\"The ceremony is attended by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, members of the government, parliamentarians, and representatives of diplomatic missions of more than 109 countries. This year, for the third time, representatives of the diplomatic missions of Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony. Meanwhile representatives of Palestine and Israel received an invitation. After laying flowers at exactly 8:15 -- the time when the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima -- a minute of silence is declared. Then the mayor of the city, Kazumi Matsui, makes a declaration of peace, and after that, white doves are released into the sky as a symbol of peace on Earth. The ceremony traditionally features schoolchildren from the city taking a peace oath, as well as representatives of the bombing survivors. In August 1945 American pilots dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic explosion and its consequences killed 140,000 people out of a population of 350,000 in Hiroshima, and 74,000 in Nagasaki. The vast majority of victims of the atomic bombing were civilians. On the anniversary of the tragic events -- August 6 and 9 -- \"Peace Ceremonies\" are held annually in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The area of the epicenter now houses a memorial Peace Park and a museum that contains documents and exhibits related to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. There are audio guides in the languages of all countries that possess atomic weapons.

In the first millionth of a second after detonation, the bomb materials heat up to unimaginable and extreme temperatures.\n\nThe fireball forms immediately from the burning bomb residue. Anything - or anyone - inside the fireball would be vaporised in an instant.\n\nEven outside this boundary, the heat would be intense enough to kill everyone.\n\nWithin the green circle, the dose of radiation would likely be deadly in about one month. And at least 15% of survivors will eventually die of cancer as a result of the exposure.\n\nMost buildings would collapse, even within the 'moderate blast damage' radius. Injuries would be universal and fatalities widespread, Wellerstein warns.\n\nPeople in the 'third radiation' boundary would suffer third degree burns. They can cause severe scarring or disablement, and can require amputation.\n\nThe atomic bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima destroyed the city. More than 140,000 people were killed. A second bomb dropped three days later on Nagasaki killed 70,000 more.\n\nRelations between Japan and the US had deteriorated in the years before, leading to an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, in which Japan sunk several ships and destroyed hundreds of planes.\n\nTheir aim was to cripple the US fleet in the Pacific fleet. After entering the White House, president Truman took the decision to bomb Japan, in favour of an on-the-ground invasion.\n\nThe result of the detonation of 'Little Boy' was approximately 80,000 deaths in just the first few minutes. Thousands died later from radiation sickness in Hiroshima.\n\nJapan then surrendered on August 15, finally putting an end to the Second World War.\n\nJapanese officials urged world leaders today to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment - not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war.\n\nHiroshima governor Hidehiko Yuzaki said nuclear-armed nations and supporters of atomic deterrence 'deliberately ignore... the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception.'\n\nDuring an anniversary service at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, he said: 'As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday.\n\n'Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival.'\n\nMayor Kazumi Matsui said Russia's war on Ukraine and the worsening conflict in Palestine are 'deepening distrust and fear among nations'.\n\nMORE : Banksy caught on CCTV just hours before new artwork appears in London\n\nMORE : Man in his 20s stabbed to death on housing estate in east London", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gergana_krasteva@metro.co.uk", "name": "Gergana Krasteva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

tragedies' unfold", "body": "The mayor of Hiroshima said Tuesday that wars in Ukraine and Gaza were deepening fear and distrust worldwide, on the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing that devastated the Japanese city.\n\nKazumi Matsui made a sombre speech at a memorial event to commemorate the victims of the US nuclear attack on August 6, 1945 that left around 140,000 people dead.\n\n\"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nDays after the 1945 Hiroshima attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in southwest Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two strikes led to the end of World War II, and to this day Japan remains the only country to be hit by atomic weapons in wartime.\n\nDuring Tuesday's ceremony, dignitaries including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida -- all clad in black suits -- bowed deeply and laid wreaths at the memorial cenotaph featuring the inscription \"rest in peace\".\n\nToday, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million people, but the ruins of a domed building stand in the city centre as a stark reminder of the attack's horrors.\n\nFor the third year running, Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt was the city's first peace memorial since Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza last year following an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on the country.\n\nThe Israeli ambassador attended the ceremony as usual, but according to local media, Hiroshima has never invited a Palestinian representative.\n\n\"That an invitation wasn't extended to Palestine is shocking\", the Permanent General Mission of Palestine to Japan said on social media platform X last month.\n\nA city official told AFP in June that Hiroshima had called for a \"ceasefire as soon as possible and resolution through dialogue\" in its invitation letter to Israel.\n\nIsrael's ambassador has not, however, been invited to the Nagasaki peace ceremony this year.\n\nNagasaki has said the decision was not politically motivated, but rather taken to avoid any unexpected trouble.\n\ntmo/kaf/cwl", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

When I first interviewed Shoso for my work in 2012, I hadn't come across tales of orphans in Hiroshima.\n\nThe bomb, dropped by the US on August 6 1945, made orphans of around 2,000 children, mostly from central Hiroshima, who survived because they had been evacuated to the countryside. When they returned after Japan surrendered on August 15, they found their parents gone and their city razed to the ground.\n\nMore than 90% of the population of central Hiroshima perished. Almost all the families of the evacuees died; only six to 11-year-olds and the infirm had been evacuated. Once back in the city, these orphan children usually died within months; despite the efforts of local women to feed them, there just weren't enough rations to go around.\n\nAlthough author Robert Jungk had interviewed some orphans for his book Children of the Ashes, it was unusual to find a member of this group still alive to tell their story. I met Shoso through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, which curates hibakusha stories.\n\nShoso was accustomed to talking about his experience to groups gathered at the museum, where a few of the remaining survivors told their stories. They would often begin with the line, \"This is my hibakusha story ...\", relaying the facts of what happened on August 6, which is simply known in Hiroshima as \"That day\", or \"Ano hi\". Then they would weave in their own personal experiences. Shoso had been telling his story since he had retired and returned to Hiroshima. He had been away from his city, which was filled with painful memories, for more than three decades.\n\nSetting out to interview the hibakusha for my study The Last Survivors of Hiroshima I decided to take a different tack, which surprised them. When I first met Shoso in December 2012, I asked him to focus initially not on the horrific aftermath of the bomb, but on something different. I wanted to hear about what his life was like as a child before the atomic bomb. The story that emerged over the following three years came out of a growing friendship with Shoso based on that simple enquiry. Indeed all the hibakusha I interviewed for my study responded warmly to this question.\n\nBorn in March 1934, Shoso was brought up in an area of Hiroshima now known as Kakomachi. He had two sisters and three brothers including an older one who'd had been mobilised as part of Japan's colonial war effort in Manchuria. His mother was related to the Asano, the once-powerful samurai lords of Hiroshima, and his father was a glass craftsman.\n\nShoso had been evacuated to Miyoshi, a neighbouring prefecture, along with other children from his school and lodged in a temple run by a Buddhist nun. While working in the fields on August 6, 1945, he noticed a white cloud rising in the sky over Hiroshima, but no one could tell them what had happened to the city.\n\nHe was lucky. So too was his 16-year-old sister, Tokie. She had been working at Hiroshima train station when the bomb dropped, and was saved by its thick walls. The next day she went to Miyoshi to find Shoso and bring him back. Unable to locate the rest of their family, the two took shelter in the remains of the station.\n\nIt was here Shoso witnessed the way the orphans eked out survival. A black market sprang up around the station where local women set up stalls to feed the orphaned children. Older children bullied younger children; the only way the smaller ones could survive was by scraping the food left in the pans. Towards the end of 1945, Shoso saw many children die of starvation. Some were so hungry, he said, they died with stones in their mouths.\n\nIn February 1946, Tokie died too, of an undiagnosed disease, probably leukaemia. Shoso was adopted the following month by a Mr Kawanaka, the owner of a soy sauce factory in a village called Tomo. He worked there for the next 11 years.\n\nBy the time he was 23, Shoso met a girl and fell in love. They got engaged, but his fianc\u00e9e's family blocked the marriage because he had a hibakusha health certificate, which proved he had come to Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. People were afraid to be around those who had been exposed to radiation. Afterwards, vowing never to marry, Shoso lived the rest of his life alone, building up a restaurant business in the nearby city of Okayama.\n\nAlthough Shoso had told me so much, there were many silences and things left unexplained. It was clear he must have lived as a street child for about a month in 1946 when his sister died. But he said he had only \"witnessed\" the street children.\n\nA sense of shame and taboo still clings to hibakusha stories, especially those of orphans, since they remain unclassified, their entire families wiped out by the bomb. In 1945, both Japan and the US sought to censor and control the information about the horrific humanitarian consequences of the atomic bomb; this continues to have repercussions for the way the hibakusha live their lives and tell their stories.\n\nWhen Japanese people started to express outrage about the bombings, the US, now occupying the islands, imposed strict censorship in September 1945. The Australian reporter Wilfred Burchett, writing for the Daily Express, had parts of his report from the ground in Hiroshima, The Atomic Plague, censored.\n\nPhotographs and film reels of the bombed cities were then confiscated and although The Life Span study was established in 1947 to study the biological effects of radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, access to financial support for medical care only came in 1957.\n\nToday, much has been done to publish the testimonies of Hiroshima's survivors. Recently, a popular genre called \"atomic bomb culture\" has burgeoned and includes anim\u00e9 films such as In This Corner of the World, based on pre-war Hiroshima.\n\nOver a period of three years I followed up with Shoso, and revisited with him the places that were important to his childhood. He also shared many more sad stories of surviving orphans, some of them still living impoverished, difficult lives in prison, hospital or in care, well into their late seventies.\n\nOn a later occasion we shared lunch together with some other hibakusha I had interviewed. By focusing the study first of all on childhood, a common ground of shared experience opened up for other survivors too, from which powerful, healing stories could emerge. In telling his, Shoso told me, he had found his ikigai - his reason to live.", "source": {"uri": "flaglerlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FlaglerLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jungk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Jungk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrender of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchuria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samurai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algerian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Burchett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilfred Burchett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayama_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Okayama Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okayama Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/hiroshima-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C435&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 465, "textEnd": 474}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1404, "textEnd": 1412}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-12-", "textStart": 1885, "textEnd": 1898}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Japan had occupied parts of eastern China, which led to a war between the two countries in 1937.\n\nThe US and other Western countries halted exports, including vital fuel oil, to Japan in an attempt to discourage it from further expansion. Japan saw this as an aggressive act.\n\nThe countries tried to negotiate for Japan to retreat from China and the US to start exporting fuel again in late 1941, but could not agree on terms.\n\nJapan launched an air attack on the US air base of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941, killing 2,403 American service people and wounding a further 1,178.\n\nThe attack was later judged a war crime because it took place unannounced and while peace talks were ongoing. US President Franklin Roosevelt called it \"a day which will live in infamy\".\n\nBoth countries declared war on each other shortly after the attack.\n\nThe US and Japan had been at war for nearly four years, since April 1941. The bloody and fiercely fought conflict in the Pacific had cost millions of Japanese and Americans their lives already.\n\nThe war in Europe had finished nearly two months earlier, in May 1945, after Germany's unconditional surrender. The US was preparing for a land invasion of Japan, which would have been very hard-fought. At least 500,000 Americans alone would have been likely to die, according to US government estimates at the time.\n\nAt the same time, the US had been developing to make nuclear bombs since the late 1930s. The bombs were ready by the summer of 1945.\n\nThe Allies called for Japan to surrender in late July 1945, threatening \"complete and utter destruction\" otherwise.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets for their military and industrial importance, as they supplied the Japanese armed forces with weapons and other military technologies.\n\nA uranium bomb nicknamed Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6. The city was devastated: tens of thousands died almost immediately and as many as 146,000 died in the three months after the attack.\n\nMany more would go on to suffer from cancer and other forms of illness brought on by the radiation from the bomb. Huge numbers of buildings were completely destroyed or damaged.\n\nJapanese authorities were reportedly aware another strike could follow Hiroshima, but decided to endure it rather than surrender.\n\nThe next attack, a plutonium bomb nicknamed Fat Man, fell on Nagasaki on August 9. About 75,000 people were killed. In both cities, the vast majority of people who died were civilians.\n\nJapan surrendered on August 15, six days after the attack on Nagasaki. Both cities were rebuilt after the war, although Hiroshima was hit by a typhoon in September 1945 that also caused great destruction.\n\nAround 145,000 people who survived either of the bombings - called hibakusha in Japanese - were still alive in March 2019, according to the Japanese government. Memorials have been put up in both cities for the victims of the bombing.\n\nDebate continues over the ethics of the attack, in which it was the only time nuclear bombs were used in war. Some say they brought an earlier end to the Second World War, which would have led to many more casualties on both sides if the US had invaded Japan.\n\nOthers say that the use of nuclear bombs in war is inherently unethical and some labelled the attacks a war crime. Others argued there were more peaceful ways to end the war than either nuclear bombing or an invasion, such as a military blockade on Japan.\n\nThe bombs cast a long shadow over the second half of the 20th century, with the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union dominated by concerns that either country could attack the other with nuclear missiles.\n\nThe London Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament wants an end to all nuclear weapons, and asks for them to be disarmed and destroyed globally.\n\nThey hold events annually to mark the occasion and say: \"We want to create a world free of nuclear weapons. That includes scrapping Trident, the UK nuclear weapons system, and refusing to let United States nuclear weapons return to Britain. Both of these put Londoners on the front line of any nuclear attack.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons don't protect us from the real threats Britain faces, like natural disasters, health pandemics, cyber attacks, or the growing threat of war. And just think what the government of a nuclear weapons-free Britain could do with all the extra funds that scrapping Trident brings.\"\n\nAt noon today (Tuesday 6), a vigil is taking place in Kingston town centre as part of commemorations of the bombing of Hiroshima and will include a moment of silence and talks.\n\nIn Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, an annual event of remembrance also kicks off at noon, with poetry and live music.\n\nIf you fancy a picnic, people will also be gathering there, and other places.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged to pursue realistic steps towards disarmament despite the challenges.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deterrence theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidehiko_Yuzaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hidehiko Yuzaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazumi_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kazumi Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumio_Kishida", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumio Kishida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/06_08_2024_03_35_10_3366641.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations,

In fiscal 2023, the number of visitors to the Peace Memorial Museum reached a record high of 1,981,782, with foreigners comprising one-third of the total.\n\nWhat is drawing people to this city, where the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb during World War II? From May to August this year, the Mainichi Shimbun interviewed overseas visitors to the park and heard many voices mirroring fears of a potential nuclear war.\n\n\"Close your eyes, and think about peace,\" said Takao Miyakaku, a 76-year-old Tokyo-based photographer, during a photo shoot with a Norwegian family on Aug. 2 at the northern side of the park. He was photographing Marie Gronlien, 55, and her 21- and 16-year-old sons Emil and Herman.\n\nMiyakaku, whose grandfather and father survived the Aug. 6, 1945, atomic bombing, has taken thousands of photos of visitors before the Atomic Bomb Dome since 2000. He feels the number of foreign visitors has increased in recent years. During eight days in June, 33 of the 45 groups he photographed were from abroad, including countries in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nGronlien teaches history at high school in Norway, and said she was seeking to learn more about the A-bomb destruction, as well as the reconstruction of Hiroshima. But there was another purpose for her recent trip.\n\nIn Norway, military service is mandatory for men and women. Herman, who is in his first year in high school, also plans to serve in the military for a certain period after graduation. He told the reporter calmly, \"I think the military seems fun and cool. A lot of my friends do too.\"\n\nNorway, which shares a border with Russia, is apparently enveloped in heightened tension since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Gronlien says, \"I want this trip to be a chance for my sons to see how Hiroshima is now, and how it was in the past after the city was destroyed by the atomic bombing. I want them to see this with their own eyes and choose what to do from there.\"\n\nAccording to Miyakaku, many Europeans and Americans that he meets are feeling a strong sense of crisis and urgency regarding world leaders' threats of using nuclear weapons. \"Japan is the only country that has experienced an atomic bombing, but now, as an island country, it has a physical distance with war. The sense of awareness among Japanese people is much lower than that of Westerners.\"\n\nThe reporter also approached visitors at the exit of the Peace Memorial Museum, which displays photos, burnt clothes, video records of survivors, and other material showing the damage caused by the atomic bombing. Lauri Laine, a 25-year-old from Finland, said, \"Nuclear disarmament would be great, but currently Russia and China are threats, so the West need their nuclear arsenal full.\" Finland itself doesn't possess nuclear weapons, but is under the nuclear umbrella of NATO, which it joined in April 2023, following the Ukraine invasion. Laine said he feels fear when he encounters news of leaders and others in Russia suggesting the use of nuclear weapons, or threatening \"demonstrative\" bombings.\n\nAt the south side of the Atomic Bomb Dome, Kosei Mito, shares information on the atomic bombing with visitors in English. Mito was in his mother's womb during the atomic bombing. He has been standing before the dome almost every day since 2006, and has spoken with around 100,000 foreigners from around 180 countries.\n\nIn early July, Mito encountered a scene for the first time during his almost 20 years of standing in front of the Dome. Midway through Mito's explanation, a middle-aged Indian man interrupted and raised his voice, claiming, \"I stand with nuclear deterrence. We must have nuclear weapons.\" A couple of families from Europe stepped in to stop the heckling, and this led to heated debate. \"I feel that awareness of nuclear weapons is rising. It's important to first educate people on the facts of the atomic bombing destruction, and I try to give an accurate explanation,\" Mito said.\n\nFurther south in the peace park, seven \"hibakusha\" survivor groups gather about once every two months for a petition to gather signatures demanding the Japanese government join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Steven Pam, a 53-year-old office worker from Melbourne, Australia, expressed surprise that \"those who survived the atomic bombing are still alive and taking action toward abolishing nuclear weapons.\"\n\nIn the basement room of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Michiko Yamaoka, 73, was speaking with U.S. tourists. Yamaoka, who was inspired by Mito to take up learning English, started volunteering as a peace park guide in 2008. \"Through my talks with overseas visitors, I'd like to open the first page for them to learn about the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima.\"\n\nAfter being guided around the park by Yamaoka and visiting the Peace Memorial Museum, Emily Harmon, a 29-year-old high school teacher in Texas, said, \"I learned how the devastation practically wiped all living things in its path, barely leaving structures behind. Firsthand accounts by hibakusha survivors struck my heart.\"\n\nWhen asked about the current U.S. nuclear arms policy, Harmon said, \"While I see the logic in the argument to have nuclear weapons as deterrents, we should focus on better options (such as nuclear disarmament). My time in Hiroshima is something I want to share with my students.\"\n\n(By Chinami Takeichi and Kana Nemoto, Hiroshima Bureau)", "source": {"uri": "mainichi.jp", "dataType": "news", "title":

the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing that devastated the Japanese city.\n\nKazumi Matsui made a sombre speech at a memorial event to commemorate the victims of the US nuclear attack on August 6, 1945 that left around 140,000 people dead.\n\n\"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nDays after the 1945 Hiroshima attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in southwest Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two strikes led to the end of World War II, and to this day Japan remains the only country to be hit by atomic weapons in wartime.\n\nDuring Tuesday's ceremony, dignitaries including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida -- all clad in black suits -- bowed deeply and laid wreaths at the memorial cenotaph featuring the inscription \"rest in peace\".\n\nToday, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million people, but the ruins of a domed building stand in the city centre as a stark reminder of the attack's horrors.\n\nFor the third year running, Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt was the city's first peace memorial since Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza last year following an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on the country.\n\nThe Israeli ambassador attended the ceremony as usual, but according to local media, Hiroshima has never invited a Palestinian representative.\n\n\"That an invitation wasn't extended to Palestine is shocking\", the Permanent General Mission of Palestine to Japan said on social media platform X last month.\n\nA city official told AFP in June that Hiroshima had called for a \"ceasefire as soon as possible and resolution through dialogue\" in its invitation letter to Israel.\n\nIsrael's ambassador has not, however, been invited to the Nagasaki peace ceremony this year.\n\nNagasaki has said the decision was not politically motivated, but rather taken to avoid any unexpected trouble.\n\ntmo/kaf/cwl\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge

The gains from science innovation, from medical breakthroughs culminating in the cure of diseases to technologies connecting the world and converting it into a global village, are deep and far-reaching. However, these same very innovations that would uplift societies can result in unintended consequences, as shown by Hiroshima Day events.\n\nThe Promises of Science and Technology\n\nScience and technology have changed the very fabric of human existence. The advances in medical science have resulted in vaccines, antibiotics, and treatments that have saved millions. Food security has been enhanced with agricultural innovations increasing production. Technological strides have transformed communication, now able to reach across the globe in an instant. Space exploration has opened vast frontiers in the understanding of the universe and has inspired generations.\n\nThe Shadows of Technological Advancement\n\nThough all these benefits are realized under the current achievement of science and technology, the adverse effects cannot be totally ruled out. The very advances that provide solutions introduce new problems. Industrialization and technological development for environmental degradation caused climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and related impact. The information technology raised issues with the spread regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and digital divide. Besides, military technological growth increased the intensity and effects of conflicts.\n\nHiroshima Day: A Grim Reminder\n\nOne of the deepest examples of the negative effects of scientific progress is the Hiroshima bombing. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb with the codename \"Little Boy\" on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. This event was an immediate result of the progress made in nuclear technology and became one of the darkest minutes of human history. In terms of instantaneous damages, the bomb explosion totally destroyed most of the city and killed approximately 140,000 people by the end of 1945. The survivors of this attack, currently known as hibakusha, experienced critical physical and emotional suffering due to the radiation sickness and injuries sustained. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima, followed by that of Nagasaki three days later, was instrumental in Japan's surrender and thus in ending World War II. However, on the bright side, that heralded an equally frightening aspect of scientific progress applied to warfare. Most of the hibakusha are now elderly, most of them in their late 80s and 90s. The current living population of hibakusha has decreased due to natural aging; few surviving testimonials can recount the experience. A large number of the hibakusha still bear the adverse health effects brought about by exposure to radiation, such as increased cases of cancer, chronic diseases, and mental trauma. The health aspects continue to be monitored and treated.\n\nThe Japanese government extends its help to the hibakusha through a number of programs, including health benefits, financial support, and counseling. This also provides a number of specialized hospitals and medical facilities for the treatment of illnesses related to radiation. The Hibakusha have become recognized as the living testimony to history and nuclear disarmament advocates. Their testimonies undoubtedly lead in terms of raising awareness about the aftermath of nuclear war and efforts toward peace.\n\nThe Power Of Modern Nuclear Weapons:\n\nToday's nuclear weapons are far more potent than those dropped during the Second World War. In fact, contemporary nuclear weapons are capable of vast and far-reaching destruction.\n\nYield Comparison: The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had yields of approximately 15 kilotons (Hiroshima) and 21 kilotons (Nagasaki) of TNT equivalent. Modern nuclear weapons, however, attain yields from a few kilotons up to tens of megatons. For example, the largest nuclear weapons ever tested, such as the Tsar Bomb of the Soviet Union, yielded about 50 megatons, which is approximately 3,000 times more powerful than the bomb that reached Hiroshima. Destruction and Blast Effects\n\nBlast Radius: Modern 1-megaton is powerful enough to destroy several square miles. Its radius depends on the yield of the weapon and altitude of detonation. That turned into a meaning of immediate and complete annihilation around the spherical area of detonation, severe damage done at a greater distance.\n\nThermal Radiation: The high temperature of a nuclear explosion can result in serious burns and start fires, often over a considerable area. Such thermal radiations can ignite fires and destroy buildings miles away from the site of bomb blast. Radiation Effects\n\nInitial Radiation: Much of the radiation, including gamma-rays and neutrons capable of inducing acute radiation sickness and death, is emitted within nuclear explosions. Obviously, this will be most intense right next to the blast.\n\nFallout: A nuclear bomb explosion may broadcast radioactivity to large areas depending on the prevailing wind patterns. The fallout can contaminate soil, water, and air, causing long-term damage to health from increased cancerous effects and resultant genetic damage. Impact on the Environment and Long-Term Effects\n\nNuclear winter:\n\nThe effect of a full-scale nuclear exchange could be such that temperatures suddenly drop globally, due to the quantity of soot and dust that prevent the sun's rays from passing through; this phenomenon is popularly known as \"nuclear winter.\" Worldwide disruptions to ecosystems, agriculture, and food supplies will be the consequences.\n\nLong Term Effects:\n\nThe long-term environmental impacts on the land and water, lasting radiation effects, and disruptions to human and ecological systems make for a grim scenario. Psychological Impact: The potential destruction on a largescale and long-term environmental damages are various psychological and geopolitical effects that add to the anxiety of the world at large and actually are an impetus toward arms control and disarmament measures.\n\nIt is, however, ironic that some of the powerful countries who aim to disarm nuclear weapons impose restrictions on other countries and deliver lectures on peace, although they are exponentially increasing arsenals and suppressing other countries with sanctions and other destruction methods in trade.\n\nAs of 2024, the countries that possess the largest nuclear arsenals include:\n\nIt is approximated that there are 5,400 nuclear warheads in the United States. The US has the largest number of warheads, with a large percentage in reserve or awaiting dismantlement.\n\nRussia: approximately 5,500 nuclear warheads The total Russian stockpile is somewhat larger than that of the United States, although it holds far fewer warheads in reserve. China's inventory is somewhere around 410 nuclear warheads. Nuclear arsenals have been growing in China, but it still has a much smaller stockpile than either the United States or Russia. France: Some 290 nuclear warheads represent a much more modest yet no less significant stature.\n\nUK: 225 nuclear warheads -- although small, comparative to the leading nuclear powers. Apart from these two, other nuclear powers are India, Pakistan, and North Korea; each of them maintains smaller arsenals. Arms control and further efforts at disarmament have been specially tailor-made to keep nuclear retainers from increasing, thereby lowering the overall number of weapons within the hands of states.\n\nThe Path to Disarmament:\n\nDisarmament became a complicated and highly challenging task, yet is still feasible and very relevant to set such an objective in the world today. On the path to arms control, there are major considerations toward attaining disarmament, more specifically nuclear disarmament:\n\nInternational Agreements\n\nTreaties and frameworks: Present international treaties, among them the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, provide legal frameworks for actual disarmament. These treaties target non-proliferation, reduction of stockpiles, and elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nVerification and Compliance: Robust verification mechanisms would be needed to ensure that the disarmament agreements are adhered to fully. International organizations like IAEA have significant roles in monitoring compliance. Security: Most countries feel that possessing nuclear weapons is their necessary requirement for national security and deterrence. It is very important to address these security concerns so as to press for further disarmament. Confidence-building measures, strategic dialogues, and security assurances would reduce fears and gain confidence. Effective disarmament needs cooperation between nuclear-armed and non-nuclear states. Through diplomacy, negotiations, and multilateral forums, one can enable the means for discussion and reaching agreements. Historical agreements, like START and INF, have successfully reduced nuclear arsenals. Similar agreements must be negotiated and implemented in a continuing manner. There are several global initiatives and organizations oriented toward disarmament. For instance, there is the United Nations, Global Zero, and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Such efforts work to shape international norms and assist in promoting disarmament. In summary, disarmament is an enormously difficult yet realistic and necessary objective. Progress involves cooperation between nations, verification, assuagement of security concerns, high political will, and public support. The current ongoing processes and the role of diplomacy play important functions to move toward a world with fewer, if not no nuclear weapons at all.\n\nA vision For Future:\n\nLet us work for a world with no instruments of destruction, under the gleam of love and peace for one and all.

Iwakuni is located on the western side of the bay in a relatively flat, open area while Kure is embedded in a region of mountains and mountainous islands with almost complete protection from all directions.\n\nThe city of Hiroshima is located on the deltas of southwestern Honshu Island facing the Inland Sea. Hiroshima, the City of International Peace and Culture, was originally a reedy delta, but it began to develop as a city after the construction of the Hiroshima Castle and surrounding houses at the end of 16th century.\n\nThe city is said to have originated in Tensho 17 (1589 A.D.) during the Azuchi Momoyama Period when Terumoto Mori began building a castle at the mouth of the Ota River. On April 15, 1589, Terumoto appointed Naritoki Ninomiya and Motokiyo Hoita magistrates in charge of construction and ordered them to begin the foundation work with all possible speed. The next year the castle town was laid out, the moat dug, and the castle buildings themselves were under construction. Castle construction proceeded even though during that year Terumoto was on duty protecting Kyoto, while Hideyoshi Toyotomi was attacking Odawara Castle. Terumoto moved into the castle in 1593 when construction was nearly complete. It was clearly constructed in a great hurry.\n\nEarth and sand, washed down by the Ota River, accumulated in the bay over a long period of time and formed a number of flat islands. At that time people began to occupy these islands and called the area \"Gokaura\" or \"Gokasho\" or \"Gokason\" (Five Villages). Some say that the name of Hiroshima came from the fact that the castle was built on the largest of the islands. (Hiro means large; shima means island.) Hiroshima Castle is also called \"Rijo\" (the Castle of the Carp). This is because \"Koi\" in Koi-ura, the whole area where the castle was located, is a homonym of carp in Japanese.\n\nWith the completion of the castle, as retainers moved in from Yoshida, merchants and artisans were recruited from many places. Thus, a new castle town, befitting a great feudal lord, was born. Rivers running through the town were utilized for water transport, connecting the town with the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nDuring the Edo Period, the expansion of arable land through land reclamation and a burgeoning population generated vigorous commerce. Eventually, Hiroshima became a major urban center, following Edo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and Kanazawa. By 1864, the Tokugawa government no longer held power as in the past, and rapid changes in the world were bringing about the breakdown of feudalism. Hiroshima became a military base for the Tokugawa government with the possibility of becoming a dangerous battle field. By 1866 the powerlessness of the Tokugawa government was revealed to the whole country, and the political situation took a sudden turn from restoring power to the Tokugawa government to the establishment of imperial rule.\n\nIn 1868, the new Meiji government was formed. With the inauguration of the new government, the system of the administration of local municipalities was also changed. In July, 1871, the feudal clan system was abolished and the Hiroshima fief became Hiroshima Prefecture. The castle town of Hiroshima began the process of rebirth as one of the most important cities of Japan. In Meiji 22 (1889), the municipal system was implemented, and Hiroshima developed into a modern city with a dual military and academic character.\n\nJapan, which had been victorious in the early stages of the war, lost the battle of Guadalcanal in 1943. Afterwards, the military situation grew steadily worse, and it appeared that the mainland of Japan would be turned into a battlefield. The army hurriedly prepared for a decisive battle on the mainland. With these preparations Hiroshima was to take on a new role. Japan was divided into two parts; the First General Headquarters was placed in Tokyo, and the Second General Headquarters (under the command of Marshal Shunroku Hata) in Hiroshima, where the headquarters of the Chugoku District Governor-General (led by Isei Otsuka), the highest administrative body commissioned by the central government, was also established.\n\nBy 1945 Hiroshima had a civilian population of almost 300,000 and was an important military center, containing about 43,000 soldiers. Occasional bombs, which did no great damage, had fallen on Hiroshima. Many nearby cities in turn were destroyed, but Hiroshima itself remained largely unscathed. There were almost daily observation planes flying over the city, but none of them dropped bombs. The citizens wondered why they alone had remained undisturbed for such a long time.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Men, women, children and the elderly are being shot through with bullets or blown to pieces by missiles,\" said the Hiroshima governor while the TV channels were showing the participation of Israeli ambassador at the event, according to an X user @horiris.\n\n- War on Gaza 'shattering normal life,\" says mayor\n\nHiroshima's invite to Israel has been slammed as double standards as Japan has refused to invite Russia and Belarus since Moscow launched its war on Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\n\nIt has not invited any representative from Palestinian Embassy either.\n\nAmbassador Waleed Siam, however, has been invited to virtually address an alternate peace event.\n\n\"It seems to me that these global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that, to solve international problems, we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting,\" he added.\n\nAccording to @kojiskojis social media user on X, some pro-Palestine protesters in Tokyo also held placards, urging boycott of the Israeli products.\n\nA \"die-in\" protest was also held outside Israeli Embassy in Tokyo, according to @mkimpo_kid.\n\nThe protest was held around the same time when moments of silence were observed in Hiroshima to commemorate the victims of US nuclear bombing.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni

Russia, which continues its aggression against Ukraine, and Belarus, which supports Russia, were not invited to the event.\n\nAt 8:15 a.m., the time the atomic bomb was dropped, representatives of families of the deceased rang the Peace Bell, and attendees observed a minute's silence.\n\nIn his Peace Declaration, Matsui emphasized the importance of dialogue amid growing tensions due to Russia's protracted aggression against Ukraine and the worsening situation in the Middle East. He also made reference to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who brought the Cold War to an end through dialogue with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"Let us be as determined as our forebears, and, united as one, with hope in our hearts, take collective action. Our unity will move leaders now relying on nuclear deterrence to shift their policies. We could make that happen,\" Matsui said.\n\nThe Hiroshima mayor called on the Japanese government to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as soon as possible.\n\nIn his own address, Kishida stressed that Japan, the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack, is duty bound to work toward realizing a \"world free of nuclear weapons\" by firmly upholding the three non-nuclear principles.\n\n\"We will lead the international community in building momentum for nuclear disarmament,\" Kishida said.\n\nAt the Cenotaph for the Atomic Bomb Victims, an updated register of deceased victims was presented. With the addition of 5,079 atomic bomb victims whose deaths were confirmed over the past year, 344,306 people are now listed in the register.\n\nAs of the end of March, there were 106,825 who had been affected by the bombs and were still alive, with an average age of 85.58 nationwide, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. That was 6,824 fewer than the previous year.\n\nPassing on memories of the war has become a pressing task given the age of atomic bomb survivors.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp",

On Aug. 9, 1945, a second bombing was dropped on Nagasaki.\n\nThe atomic bombs instantly took thousands of lives and thousands more in the aftermath from radiation and injury.\n\nThe bombings led to Japan's surrender, bringing an end to World War II, which claimed the lives of 418,500 American civilians and soldiers, according to The National WWII Museum.\n\nMORE PEOPLE EXPOSED TO MANHATTAN PROJECT CHEMICALS DESERVE COMPENSATION, ADVOCATES SAY\n\nThe controversial decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan is still debated today.\n\nBelow is more information about the development of the atomic bomb and the causalities that resulted in the bombings.\n\nThe atomic bomb was developed in a secret government initiative known as the Manhattan Project, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Army Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves was appointed director of the Manhattan Project and chose theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to lead the physics aspects involved in the making of the atomic bomb, according to the source.\n\nAL JAZEERA VIDEO SLAMMING 'OPPENHEIMER' FOR NOT CHALLENGING US 'WAR CRIMES' AGAINST JAPAN GOES VIRAL\n\nOppenheimer became known as the \"father of the atomic bomb.\"\n\nMore than 130,000 people were employed in the highly classified mission to create the first atomic bombs, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nThe project had a budget of over $2 billion, according to the source. On July 16, 1945, the first nuclear explosion occurred in a test near Los Alamos, New Mexico, according to the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. The atomic bomb test was code named \"Trinity\" and was a success.\n\nIn 2023, the Christopher Nolan directed film \"Oppenheimer\" was released, telling the story of the life of the theoretical physicist who had a large hand in the invention of the atomic bomb.\n\n'OPPENHEIMER' PREMIERES IN JAPAN MONTHS AFTER US RELEASE, SPARKING EMOTIONAL REACTIONS\n\nThousands of people died during the Hiroshima bombing, both immediately and from radiation symptoms weeks later.\n\nThe final causality numbers from the Hiroshima bombing are unknown. Though the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, code-named \"Little Boy,\" directly killed around 70,000 people, according to History.com. Others died from injuries and radiation sickness, which increased the death toll to over 100,000.\n\nIn the years following the bombing, even more people were killed in the aftermath of the bomb, due to cancer and other long-term radiation effects, according to History.com.\n\n'MINUTES TO HIROSHIMA': THE STORY BEHIND THE ATOMIC BOMBINGS THAT ENDED WWII\n\nThree days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a second bomb, code-named \"Fat Boy,\" was dropped on Nagasaki. It is estimated that between 60,000 and 80,000 were killed in Nagasaki, according to History.com. This includes those that died from direct exposure and from the long-term side effects of radiation.\n\nThe United States bombed Hiroshima during World War II. The bombs were dropped so that Japan would quickly surrender, and the war would end.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 1945, the first of two atomic bombs was dropped on Japan, in the city of Hiroshima. The 9,700-pound bomb, according to the Nuclear Museum, was dropped by The Enola Gay, a B-29 Superfortress plane. The second of the two bombs was dropped three days later on Nagasaki.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe atomic bombs did lead to the end of the war and President Truman announced Japan's surrender on Aug. 14, 1945.\n\nTruman's decision to drop the bombs is still debated today.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlyn_messier@foxnews.com", "name": "Ashlyn Messier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

In Hiroshima, their total stood at just 32 in April, according to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, making how to pass down their stories an increasingly pressing issue.\n\nTabimachi-Gate Hiroshima first operated the so-called peace tours in the summer of 2020 and introduced virtual reality headsets the following year.\n\nIt uses images created based on the lived experiences of Eizo Nomura, who was the only survivor inside a building that features in the tour that was just 170 metres (558 feet) from ground zero, as well as photographs and material that documented the blast. Forty-seven at the time, Nomura died in 1982.\n\nThe images have been updated since the tour\u2019s launch based on feedback from survivors, some of whom said the reality was even worse than that portrayed.\n\nThe images now show the burned-out remnants of the city under a blood-red sky and specks of ash, as well as survivors with their blast injuries and the dead.\n\nBut the company is keen to distance itself from the label of \u201cdark tourism\u201d, which focuses on visits to places of death or tragedy, saying the tour also underscores a message of peace.\n\n\u201cWe focused not just on the immediate effects of the atomic bomb but also on how the city has steadily built itself back up over the years,\u201d Masushige says.\n\nA version that omits people from the landscape is available for students, as well as for adults who would like to opt out of the more visceral imagery.\n\nFollowing the tour, participants gather at the Rest House, a former kimono store where Nomura survived, to reflect upon what they learned. One wall is covered with their Post-it notes that wish for peace in multiple languages.\n\nSome of those are from hibakusha themselves who have taken the tour. \u201cA bright future for the children,\u201d one says.\n\nMasushige says: \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can experience every day, so we hope it provides an opportunity to think deeply about peace.\u201d\n\nThe tours cost 3,500 yen (US$24) per adult and 1,000 yen for a child between the ages of 6 and 11.

The bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of tens of thousands of people, with the total number of casualties, including those from radiation sickness and injuries, rising to over 200,000. Hiroshima, targeted first, saw the \"Little Boy\" bomb obliterate much of the city, while Nagasaki was struck by the \"Fat Man\" bomb three days later.\n\nThe immense destruction and loss of life precipitated Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, effectively ending World War II. These events also ushered in the nuclear age, highlighting the devastating power of atomic weapons and sparking global debates on nuclear ethics, warfare, and disarmament. The bombings remain a somber reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear conflict and the importance of striving for peace and international cooperation.\n\nThe devastation, which claimed the lives of civilians, imprinted an indelible mark on the nation's collective consciousness and laid the foundation for its pacifist constitution. In the aftermath of these horrific events, Japan adopted a policy of defensive neutrality, enshrined in Article 9 of its constitution, renouncing war and prohibiting the maintenance of armed forces for combat.\n\nThis commitment to pacifism became a cornerstone of Japan's identity, earning it a place of respect in the global community and even frequent nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. However, as the world grapples with evolving geopolitical threats, Japan has announced a significant shift in its defence policy.\n\nThe government has decided to allocate 2% of its GDP to defence spending, marking a departure from its longstanding pacifist stance. This decision, driven by perceived threats from North Korea and China, positions Japan as the second-largest arms importer globally, following Saudi Arabia.\n\nJapan's new national security strategy is a response to the growing tensions in the region. North Korea has already conducted missile tests capable of reaching Japanese territory, while China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and its broader regional ambitions have raised alarms in Tokyo.\n\nThese developments have prompted Japan to reconsider its post-World War II defence posture. Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a staunch advocate for revising Japan's pacifist constitution, argued that the nation must strengthen its military capabilities to counter regional threats. Although Abe's tenure saw some legislative changes allowing for a modest self-defence force, widespread public opposition prevented a complete overhaul of Article 9. Nonetheless, Abe's vision of a robust Japanese military continues to influence current policies.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, with the backing of both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, has pressed forward with this new defence agenda. However, public sentiment remains largely against these changes. According to a Kyodo News Agency survey, 80% of the population opposes the government's constitutional amendment efforts, reflecting a deep-rooted commitment to pacifism among the Japanese people.\n\nThe decision to shift defence policies on the anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is particularly poignant. The memories of the atomic bombings serve as a stark reminder of the horrors of war and the importance of peace. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not just a military strategy but also an unprecedented human tragedy. The bombings, justified by the U.S. as necessary to end the war, were, in reality, cruel scientific experiments that unleashed untold suffering and long-term consequences.\n\nThe atomic bombings forced Japan to adopt a peace-oriented constitution, promoting disarmament and dialogue over conflict. Article 9 has been a symbol of hope and a testament to Japan's commitment to ensuring that such devastation never occurs again.\n\nThe policy shift, therefore, raises important questions about the future of pacifism in Japan and its role in international peace and security. As Japan increases its defence budget and modernizes its military capabilities, it steps into a complex and competitive arms race.\n\nThe nation that once stood as a beacon of pacifism now finds itself at a crossroads, balancing its historical commitment to peace with the pressing need to address contemporary security challenges. The legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki endures, reminding the world of the catastrophic consequences of war and the enduring value of peace.\n\nAs Japan navigates this new defence trajectory, it must reconcile its past with its present, ensuring that the principles of peace and humanity remain at the forefront of its national identity.\n\nIn the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan's defence policy evolution marks a significant chapter in its history. The world watches closely as Japan seeks to uphold its commitment to peace while safeguarding its future in an increasingly uncertain global landscape.\n\nThe devastating bombings marked a turning point in World War II, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of the conflict. These tragic events imprinted a commitment to pacifism in Japan's national consciousness, enshrined in its post-war constitution.\n\nHowever, with rising geopolitical threats from North Korea's missile tests and China's regional ambitions, Japan has no choice but to reconsider its pacifist stance and increase its defence spending, sparking a national debate on the future of its long-held commitment to peace.\n\n(The writer is an asssociate professor Centre For South Asian Studies, School of International Studies & Social Sciences Pondicherry Central University; views are personal)",

"body": "The governor of in has made an impassioned plea to world leaders to get rid of as the Japanese city marks the 79th anniversary of a nuclear attack that left around 140,000 people dead and caused massive devastation.\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday,\" Hidehiko Yuzaki said in his address at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future, \" he said. \"Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since to human survival.\"\n\nHiroshima's mayor, Kazumi Matsui, used his speech at the same event to highlight how current conflicts were normalizing the use of military force as a means to solve problems.\n\nMatsui said Russia's ongoing and the in Gaza are \"claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life.\"\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nThe ceremony in Hiroshima was attended by some 50,000 people, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThey observed a minute of silence with the sound of a peace bell at 8:15 a.m., the time when a US B-29 bomber dropped the bomb on the city.\n\nThe commemorative event comes just days after Japan and the US reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" which includes the possible use of atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally amid growing regional tensions.\n\nOpen discussion of nuclear deterrence in Japan is a radical shift away from the country's previous reluctance to touch on such issues as the only nation in the world to have suffered atomic attacks.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, shortly before the end of , US forces detonated a nuclear bomb over the city in a bid to force Japan to surrender.\n\nIn addition to the tens of thousands of people who immediately died in the explosion, the attack left a terrible legacy in the many survivors of the bombings who had lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure.\n\nDays after the attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in southwest Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two attacks led to Japan's surrender on September 2.",

Today is marked as a solemn day of remembrance in Hiroshima and Japan, and just as it is every year, the anniversary has also been acknowledged by well-meaning but patronizing messages of peace from the rest of the world. Centuries or millennia from now, when some voyagers from another part of the galaxy find their way to this dusty corner of the cosmos to gaze upon the fossilized corpse of this civilization, the date will be marked as the moment we destroyed ourselves.\n\nMankind's brightest minds had been working up to that moment for about seven years by the time the bomb named \"Little Boy\" exploded over Hiroshima. Almost the very first thought inspired by the discovery of nuclear fission in December 1938 was \"bomb.\" German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman identified fission on December 19. Austrian physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch published a paper explaining it theoretically the following month. About three weeks later, in February 1939, Hahn and Strassman published their second paper, pulling all the early calculations together to reach a dependable conclusion: \"Hey, this would make a good bomb.\"\n\nBy August 1939 -- a month before World War II in Europe even started -- both the governments of the US and UK had been made aware of this. The Nazi government of Germany was certainly aware of it, too, because it had the services of one of history's most brilliant physicists, Werner Heisenberg, a guy J. Robert Oppenheimer thought was possibly smarter than he was. The Nazis were simply slow to pick up on the implications of the new discoveries because the Nazis were a bunch of depraved morons. Imagine a government staffed by a couple of thousand Donald Trumps but in slightly better shape and dressed nicer, and you get the picture.\n\nThe Japanese empire and the Soviet Union also knew, and both started research programs toward developing a weapon. Neither of them accomplished much during the war for various reasons, but it is safe to say that what happened on Aug. 6, 1945, was not as much of a surprise to the world as it is typically portrayed in the history books.\n\nIronically, the British research program, which was under a group called the MAUD Committee, realized that nuclear fission had potential applications as a source of peaceful energy almost as quickly as its potential as an explosive was understood. The committee produced two papers for the British government in early 1940, one for a bomb and one for research toward what would eventually become the world's first practical power reactors. Since there was a war, \"bomb\" was obviously the priority; in July 1940, the British offered to share their research with the US, which eventually led to the US effort being gathered together under the US Army Corps of Engineers as the Manhattan Project in June 1942.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThree years and $2 billion later (about $35 billion today), the project was able to successfully test-fire the world's first atomic bomb in the desert in New Mexico. Besides that first bomb, the US had at that point produced enough plutonium for three more -- one of which would be exploded over Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945 -- plus enough uranium-235 for the one bomb that would be dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nThe technical and political histories of the atomic bomb up to its use on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are fascinating, but what is perhaps more interesting, in a horrifying way, is the manifestation of humanity's self-destructive character revealed in full at quarter-past eight in the morning on Aug. 6, 1945.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe justification by the US for actually using the weapon then and in the years since that it gigged the Japanese leadership into surrendering without an invasion of the Japanese home islands being necessary and thus saving millions of lives has been endlessly debated in the decades since. In the narrow, immediate context of the war at that moment in time, the justification was actually correct, and the counter-arguments that \"Japan was already beaten\" are specious; after all, in his surrender message to the Japanese people, Emperor Hirohito specifically cited the advent of \"a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\"\n\nHirohito understood, and it is unfortunate that the world has largely ignored the prescience in his message. We humans are too smart for our own good, and throughout our history, we have demonstrated time and again that it is our inescapable nature that if we can do a thing, we will do that thing. The emperor understood that only Japan's surrender in the face of the threat of atomic destruction could possibly save the world; whether he understood that it would be futile anyway is something we will never know. Because it is also an inescapable part of our nature that if we do something once, we will do it again.\n\nUntil the atomic bomb, mankind had not discovered the ability to utterly destroy ourselves with the press of a button. And despite understanding that we have that ability, despite openly acknowledging that we must not act on it, what we have done in the meantime is constantly improve on it. The US, for example, is pursuing a massive, 30-year program to upgrade its entire nuclear force -- new missiles, new bombs, new and more powerful warheads -- that will cost something around $1.5 trillion. Russia and China are likewise putting a great deal of effort and resources into improving their arsenals. Countries such as the UK, France and India are doing what is necessary to at least maintain theirs in a state of proper readiness. And then we have wild cards such as North Korea, Iran and Israel, whose progress and intentions can only be speculated.\n\nThe message from the solemn remembrance of Hiroshima every year is always, \"Never forget, and never again.\" But Hiroshima will happen again because the only way humanity can stop itself from opening Pandora's box is if the box doesn't exist in the first place. We may have been lucky to avoid our self-immolation for the better part of a century -- very lucky if you know anything about the history of Cold War nuclear alerts -- but the fact that we continue to create things like social media, AI and \"gain-of-function\" viruses shows that luck is all it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[email protected]", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_kritz@manilatimes.net", "name": "Ben Kritz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Strassmann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fritz Strassmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Otto Hahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_nuclear_fission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discovery of nuclear fission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

devastated the Japanese city.\n\nMr Kazumi Matsui made a sombre speech at a memorial event to commemorate the victims of the US nuclear attack on Aug 6, 1945 that left around 140,000 people dead.\n\n\"Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation between Israel and Palestine are claiming the lives of countless innocent people and shattering normal life\", he said.\n\n\"These global tragedies are deepening distrust and fear among nations, reinforcing the public assumption that to solve international problems we have to rely on military force, which we should be rejecting.\"\n\nDays after the 1945 Hiroshima attack, a second US nuclear bomb hit Nagasaki in south-west Japan, killing around 74,000 people.\n\nThe two strikes led to the end of World War II, and to this day Japan remains the only country to be hit by atomic weapons in wartime.\n\nDuring the Aug 6 ceremony, dignitaries, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, all clad in black suits, bowed deeply and laid wreaths at the memorial cenotaph featuring the inscription \"rest in peace\".\n\nToday, Hiroshima is a thriving metropolis of 1.2 million people, but the ruins of a domed building stand in the city centre as a stark reminder of the attack's horrors.\n\nFor the third year running, Russia and Belarus were not invited to the ceremony because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt was the city's first peace memorial since Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza in 2023 following an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on the country.", "source": {"uri":

In the history of human civilisation, no other war saw as much destruction as that battle witnessed. Lakhs of people died all over the world, mostly in Europe which was the centre stage of the battle as participating powerful countries asked scientists to come up with weapons which could inflict maximum damage on the opposition. The loss of civilian lives became a mere ritual as the bombing from aircraft highlighted little consideration for the plights of the common people. Today is the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day when a mass of innocent people were slaughtered at one go for victory with a weapon which would change the dynamic of global politics and wars forever.\n\nThe entry of the United States in the battle was a defining moment in World War II, as it changed the entire complexion of the war. Whatever chances the Axis camp with its main players, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and Benito Mussolini's Italy had almost evaporated with the entry of the US on behalf of the Allies, already a strong global power with its strong economy and sophisticated weapons. But little did anybody know that the matter would take a deadly turn.\n\nNotably, Imperial Japan also participated in the war and fought for the Axis powers. Its determined effort in the war, especially against the US, proved to be a pivotal incident in the war. While the Allied powers, mainly the UK and France were trying to turn the tide in Europe, Japan and the US were in a separate struggle. During the conflict, the Japanese army executed the terrible Pearl Harbor attack which not only killed several Americans but also shocked the US administration as the attack, as per reports, was uncalled for.\n\nThe vengeance of the US was fierce. With the help of the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer who is often hailed as the 'Father of the Atomic Bomb', the US became the owner of nuclear weapons, the first time human civilisation had witnessed such a thing. And the country decided to use it in Japan. On August 6 and 9, 1945, the US ravaged the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by dropping atomic bombs on them. Overall, the bombings killed between 150,000 and 246,000 people, mostly common people and to date, it remains the only two times that nuclear weapons have been used in an armed conflict, albeit both by one country. It forced Japan to surrender on August 15 and on September 2, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, bringing an end to the most devastating war in history.\n\nDuring World War II, Hiroshima was a city of immense importance, both militarily and industrially. It was home to several military units including Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army headquarters, which was in charge of the defense of the entire southern Japan. During the time of the bombings, around 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in Hiroshima.\n\nFor the Japanese military, the city was an important place for supply and logistics as it acted as a communications centre, an assembly area for troops and an important shipping port. The city had several war industries to churn out bombs, rifles, guns, planes and boats and notably, it was the second largest Japanese city after Kyoto where air raids did not inflict any damage.\n\nOn August 6, 'Little Boy', an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon was dropped on Hiroshima by the US. That one single atomic bomb killed 90,000 to 166,000 people with 80,000 to 156,000 being civilians. Not only did it change the mode of future wars, but also subjected Hiroshima to continued misery due to the fallout of the nuclear radiation. The power of the bomb shocked the world as over one lakh people were wiped out with one single blow.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swapnajit_kundu@news9live.com", "name": "Swapnajit Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axis powers"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Nearly every available seat is occupied, often by elderly people waiting for their names to be called. Many of these men and women don't have typical medical histories, however. They are the surviving victims of the American atomic bomb attack 79 years ago.\n\nNot many Americans have Aug. 6 circled on their calendars, but it's a day that the Japanese can't forget. Even now, the hospital continues to treat, on average, 180 survivors -- known as hibakusha -- of the blasts each day.\n\nWhen the United States dropped an atomic weapon on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, the entire citizenries of both countries were working feverishly to win World War II. For most Americans, the bomb represented a path to victory after nearly four relentless years of battle and a technological advance that would cement the nation as a geopolitical superpower for generations. Our textbooks talk about the world's first use of a nuclear weapon.\n\nMany today in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the United States detonated a bomb just three days later, talk about how those horrible events must be the last uses of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe bombs killed an estimated 200,000 men, women and children and maimed countless more. In Hiroshima 50,000 of the city's 76,000 buildings were completely destroyed. In Nagasaki nearly all homes within a mile and a half of the blast were wiped out. In both cities the bombs wrecked hospitals and schools. Urban infrastructure collapsed.\n\nAmericans didn't dwell on the devastation. Here the bombings were hailed as necessary and heroic acts that brought the war to an end. In the days immediately after the nuclear blasts, the polling firm Gallup found that 85 percent of Americans approved of the decision to drop atomic bombs over Japan. Even decades later the narrative of military might -- and American sacrifice -- continued to reign.\n\nFor the 50th anniversary of the war's end, the Smithsonian buckled to pressure from veterans and their families and scaled back a planned exhibition that would have offered a more nuanced portrait of the conflict, including questioning the morality of the bomb. The Senate even passed a resolution calling the Smithsonian exhibition \"revisionist and offensive\" and declared it must \"avoid impugning the memory of those who gave their lives for freedom.\"\n\nIn Japan, however, the hibakusha and their offspring have formed the backbone of atomic memory. Many see their life's work as informing the wider world about what it's like to carry the trauma, stigma and survivor's guilt caused by the bombs, so that nuclear weapons may never be used again. Their urgency to do so has only increased in recent years. With an average age of 85, the hibakusha are dying by the hundreds each month -- just as the world is entering a new nuclear age.\n\nCountries like the United States, China and Russia are spending trillions of dollars to modernize their stockpiles. Many of the safeguards that once lowered nuclear risk are unraveling, and the diplomacy needed to restore them is not happening. The threat of another blast can't be relegated to history.\n\nAnd so, as another anniversary of Aug. 6 passes, it is necessary for Americans -- and the globe, really -- to listen to the stories of the few human beings who can still speak to the horror nuclear weapons can inflict before this approach is taken again.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kathleen_kingsbury@nytimes.com", "name": "Kathleen Kingsbury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "w_j_hennigan@nytimes.com", "name": "W.J.

From Hiroshima to Seattle, and indeed around the world, Sadako's story spreads hope.\n\nSadako was just 2 years old and about a mile and a quarter away from the blast zone on that terrible day when the bomb was detonated over our city. Remarkably, she seemed unharmed -- but a decade later she was diagnosed with leukemia, then known as the \"A-bomb disease.\"\n\nWhen a friend visited her in the hospital and told her the legend of the crane -- that if she folded 1,000 cranes she would get better -- Sadako got to work. Despite folding 1,300 cranes, she died eight months later. Sadako's classmates honored her by fundraising for a monument that still stands tall in Hiroshima's own Peace Park, adorned with more than 10 million paper cranes every year.\n\nNews that she was taken from Seattle's Peace Park came at a particularly difficult time. Seventy-nine years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reckless leaders are bringing us closer to the brink of another nuclear catastrophe. Public awareness about the dangers of nuclear weapons is slowly fading as we mourn the passing of atomic bomb survivors, known as hibakusha.\n\nJust as it did in Seattle, Sadako's statue in Hiroshima offers a place to reflect on the need to eliminate the most terrible, indiscriminate and inhumane weapons on Earth. In Japan, we are reminded every day of the catastrophic danger posed by nuclear weapons -- through our memories of loved ones who lost their lives, the stories passed down by bereaved families, the experiences of the hibakusha who still suffer today and the lasting scars the bomb left on our landscape.\n\nBut for most of the world, nuclear weapons are an invisible threat, lurking in the background of every conflict and noticeably absent from most political and policy discussions. In reality, the danger posed by nuclear weapons is one of the most pressing issues facing the planet and humanity.\n\nWithout changing course, we risk repeating the grave agony of the past. Given the size and scale of today's nuclear weapons, just one detonation would cause a worldwide humanitarian crisis. It would cause massive disruptions to the environment, weather patterns and agricultural ecosystems, and could even trigger the collapse of critical infrastructure, trade and the global economy. It could mark an end to civilization as we know it today.\n\nEven the so-called \"limited\" use of nuclear weapons would have devastating environmental impacts on our planet -- potentially far worse than any of the current predicted effects of climate change.\n\nBut we are not resigned to another nuclear catastrophe -- if we claim our power. When the last nuclear arms race was spinning out of control, we came together to call for a safer world, spurring governments to eliminate 80% of global nuclear arsenals. We can do it again.\n\nToday, thanks to Sadako and a powerful act of love from her classmates, millions of people across the globe fold cranes for peace. Between Aug. 6 and 9, the dates of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, people around the world will come together to demand our leaders move us closer to a sustainable world free from nuclear weapons. I invite you to join us in folding and sharing a paper crane as a symbol of hope for our shared future.\n\nThankfully, Sadako's legacy is not confined to a statue. It lives on in each of us who continue to share her story. Together, we can honor Sadako and build a safer, more sustainable world for future generations.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Park_(Seattle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peace Park (Seattle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sadako Sasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crane (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiation-induced cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orizuru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orizuru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear arms race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08052024_tzr_tzr_112123.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 3388, "textEnd": 3400}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

To date, 97 countries have signed, ratified or acceded to it.\n\n\"While children played no part in developing these doomsday devices, it is children who would suffer the most in the event of their future use - one of the myriad reasons why such weapons must be urgently eliminated,\" said Tim Wright, the author of the report.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Campaign_to_Abolish_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of nuclear explosions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapons testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convention on the Rights of the Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Prohibition_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE0ODI1N30.nWE-dO3LpGCfrP6HKKrgMGYA-9xT8aazabGiQTfcsrM/image.png?width=210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 268, "textEnd": 276}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The plutonium bomb, nicknamed \"Fat Man,\" was rushed into readiness to take advantage of this window. No further orders were required for the attack. Truman's order of July 25th had authorized the dropping of additional bombs as soon as they were ready.\n\nTo eliminate the need to remove and reinstall complex scientific equipment from The Great Artiste, Sweeney and Capt. Frederick C. Bock had exchanged aircraft. Thus Sweeney and his crew flew Bockscar, while The Great Artiste repeated its role as the observation aircraft, but with Bock and his crew aboard.\n\nAt 3:47 a.m. on August 9, 1945, a B-29 named Bock's Car lifted off from Tinian and headed toward the primary target: Kokura Arsenal, a massive collection of war industries adjacent to the city of Kokura.\n\nFrom this point on, few things went according to plan. The aircraft commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, ordered the arming of the bomb only ten minutes after take-off so that the aircraft could be pressurized and climb above the lightning and squalls that menaced the flight all the way to Japan. (A journalist, William L. Laurence of the New York Times, on an escorting aircraft saw some \"St. Elmo's fire\" glowing on the edges of the aircraft and worried that the static electricity might detonate the bomb.) Sweeney then discovered that due to a minor malfunction he would not be able to access his reserve fuel.\n\nThe aircraft next had to orbit the city of Yokohama for almost an hour in order to rendezvous with its two escort B-29s, one of which never did arrive. The weather had been reported satisfactory earlier in the day over Kokura Arsenal, but by the time the B-29 finally arrived there, the target was obscured by smoke and haze.\n\nTwo more passes over the target still produced no sightings of the aiming point. As an aircraft crewman, Jacob Beser, later recalled, Japanese fighters and bursts of antiaircraft fire were by this time starting to make things \"a little hairy.\" Kokura no longer appeared to be an option, and there was only enough fuel on board to return to the secondary airfield on Okinawa, making one hurried pass as they went over their secondary target, the city of Nagasaki. As Beser later put it, \"there was no sense dragging the bomb home or dropping it in the ocean.\"\n\nAs it turned out, cloud cover obscured Nagasaki as well. Sweeney reluctantly approved a much less accurate radar approach on the target. At the last moment the bombardier, Captain Kermit K. Beahan, caught a brief glimpse of the city's stadium through the clouds and dropped the bomb. At 11:02 a.m., at an altitude of 1,650 feet, Fat Man exploded over Nagasaki. The yield of the explosion was later estimated at 21 kilotons, 40 percent greater than that of the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nNagasaki was an industrial center and major port on the western coast of Kyushu. As had happened at Hiroshima, the \"all-clear\" from an early morning air raid alert had long been given by the time the B-29 had begun its bombing run. A small conventional raid on Nagasaki on August 1st had resulted in a partial evacuation of the city, especially of school children. There were still almost 200,000 people in the city below the bomb when it exploded.\n\nThe hurriedly-targeted weapon ended up detonating almost exactly between two of the principal targets in the city, the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works to the south, and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Torpedo Works (right) to the north. Had the bomb exploded farther south the residential and commercial heart of the city would have suffered much greater damage.\n\nIn general, though Fat Man exploded with greater force than Little Boy, the damage at Nagasaki was not as great as it had been at Hiroshima. The hills of Nagasaki, its geographic layout, and the bomb's detonation over an industrial area all helped shield portions of the city from the weapon's blast, heat, and radiation effects. The explosion affected a total area of approximately 43 square miles. About 8.5 of those square miles were water, and 33 more square miles were only partially settled. Many roads and rail lines escaped major damage. In some areas electricity was not knocked out, and fire breaks created over the last several months helped to prevent the spread of fires to the south.\n\nAlthough the destruction at Nagasaki has generally received less worldwide attention than that at Hiroshima, it was extensive nonetheless. Almost everything up to half a mile from ground zero was completely destroyed, including even the earthquake-hardened concrete structures that had sometimes survived at comparable distances at Hiroshima.\n\nAccording to a Nagasaki Prefectural report \"men and animals died almost instantly\" within 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) of the point of detonation. Almost all homes within a mile and a half were destroyed, and dry, combustible materials such as paper instantly burst into flames as far away as 10,000 feet from ground zero. Of the 52,000 homes in Nagasaki, 14,000 were destroyed and 5,400 more seriously damaged. Only 12 percent of the homes escaped unscathed. The official Manhattan Engineer District report on the attack termed the damage to the two Mitsubishi plants \"spectacular.\"\n\nDespite the absence of a firestorm, numerous secondary fires erupted throughout the city. Fire-fighting efforts were hampered by water line breaks, and six weeks later the city was still suffering from a shortage of water. A U.S. Navy officer who visited the city in mid-September reported that, even over a month after the attack, \"a smell of death and corruption pervades the place.\" As at Hiroshima, the psychological effects of the attack were undoubtedly considerable.\n\nAs with the estimates of deaths at Hiroshima, it will never be known for certain how many people died as a result of the atomic attack on Nagasaki. The best estimate is 40,000 people died initially, with 60,000 more injured. By January 1946, the number of deaths probably approached 70,000, with perhaps ultimately twice that number dead total within five years. For those areas of Nagasaki affected by the explosion, the death rate was comparable to that at Hiroshima.\n\nThe day after the attack on Nagasaki, the emperor of Japan overruled the military leaders of Japan and forced them to offer to surrender (almost) unconditionally.\n\nIn error, The Great Artiste was named in some official reports as the superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb at Nagasaki. This mistake was discovered when preparations were being made to preserve the aircraft for later museum display. When the discrepancy was found, it was Bockscar that was retired in September 1946 to the desert storage facility at Davis-Monthan field near Tucson, Arizona.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokura", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kokura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kokura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Artiste", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Great Artiste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_C._Bock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frederick C.

Almost at the same time, the physicist who directed the bomb project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and helped pick the targets, receives a phone call from Gen. Leslie R. Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, informing him that the first bomb had gone off with quite a \"bang.\" These messages arrive suddenly, out of thin air, on August 6, 1945, and appear rather informal.\n\nOn the other hand, the official announcement for press and public had been carefully prepared and revised continually for several weeks.\n\nPresident Truman, who had approved the attack on Japan, which doomed at least 125,000 to death, faced the task, in the immediate aftermath, of telling the American press and public two shocking and astounding developments: the existence of a revolutionary new weapon, and that American forces had exploded this device of extraordinary destructive power over a Japanese target.\n\nIt was vital that this event be understood as a triumph of military power and at the same time consistent with American decency and concern for life. Everyone involved in preparing the presidential statement over the past weeks - including Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Gen. Leslie Groves - knew that the stakes were high, for this marked the creation of the official narrative of Hiroshima, which still holds sway today, though by a declining margin.\n\nWhen this shocking news emerged that morning seventy-eight years ago, President Truman was at sea, returning from the Potsdam conference, so the announcement took the form of a press release, a little more than a thousand words long. Shortly before eleven o'clock in the East, an officer from the War Department arrived at the White House bearing bundles of publicity releases. Assistant press secretary Eben Ayers shortly read the president's announcement to about a dozen members of the Washington press corps.\n\nThe statement was so momentous, and the atmosphere so casual, the reporters had trouble grasping it. \"The thing didn't penetrate with most of them,\" Ayers later recalled. At least one reporter who rushed to call his editor found a disbeliever at the other end of the line.\n\nAnd no wonder. The first sentence set the tone: \"Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base. That bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT... The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold... It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.\"\n\nTruman's four-page statement had been crafted with considerable care over many weeks, although the target city had been left blank. From its very first words, however, the official narrative was built on a lie: Hiroshima was not an \"army base\" but a city of 350,000. It did contain one important military encampment and staging area, but the bomb had been aimed at the very center of a city (and also far from its industrial area). It aimed to take advantage of what those who picked the target called the special \"focusing effect\" provided by the hills which surrounded the city on three sides. This would allow the blast to bounce back on the city, destroying more of it, and its citizens.\n\nMore than 15,000 military personnel lost their lives in the bomb but the vast majority of the dead in Hiroshima would be women, the elderly, and children. Also: many forced laborers from Korea and at least a dozen American POWs. (When Nagasaki was A-bombed three days later it was officially described as a \"naval base\" yet less than 200 of the 100,000 dead were military.)\n\nThere was something else quite vital missing in Truman's announcement: Because the president in his statement failed to mention radiation effects, which officials knew were horrendous, the imagery of just a bigger bomb would prevail in the press. Truman described the new weapon as \"revolutionary\" but only in regard to the destruction it could cause, failing to mention its most lethal new feature: radiation.\n\nAt the same time, no one but top American officials and generals knew that the Soviet Union was just hours from declaring war on Japan. \"Fini Japs\" when that occurred - even without the atomic bomb - Truman had written two weeks earlier in his diary after meeting Stalin.\n\nMany Americans first heard the news about the new bomb and the bombing from the radio, which broadcast the text of Truman's statement shortly after its release. The afternoon papers quickly arrived with banner headlines: \"Atom Bomb, World's Greatest, Hits Japs!\" and \"Japan City Blasted by Atomic Bomb.\" The Pentagon had released no pictures, so most of the newspapers relied on maps of Japan with Hiroshima circled.\n\nOne of the few early stories that did not come directly from the military was a wire service report filed by a journalist traveling with the president on the Atlantic. Approved by military censors, it depicted Truman, his voice \"tense with excitement,\" personally informing his shipmates about the atomic attack. \"The experiment,\" he announced, \"has been an overwhelming success.\"\n\nMissing from this account was Truman's exultant remark when the news of the bombing first reached the ship: \"This is the greatest thing in history!\"\n\nThe Truman announcement of the atomic bombing on August 6, 1945, firmly established the Hiroshima narrative - military necessity with no other options to end the war and countless American lives saved - that endures today.\n\nHow the \"Hiroshima narrative\" has been handed down to generations of Americans - and overwhelmingly endorsed by officials and the media, even if many historians disagree - matters greatly. Over and over, top policymakers, commentators and writers declare, \"We must never use nuclear weapons,\" yet they endorse the two times the weapons have been used against major cities in a first strike. To make any exceptions, even in the distant past, means exceptions can be made in the future. Indeed, we have already made two exceptions, with more than 200,000 civilians killed.\n\nWhy does this matter now? Few may know that the U.S. maintains its official \"first-use\" policy initiated in August 1945. Any president has full authority to order a pre-emptive first-strike not in retaliation for a nuclear launch in our direction but during any conventional war or even an overheated crisis.\n\nThe line against using nuclear weapons has been drawn... in shifting sand.\n\nMy photo, girl in Hiroshima's Peace Park, near ground zero, the memorial to the 125,000 or more dead in the distance.\n\nWatch \"Atomic Cover-up\" for free on PBS.org (shorter version) or full version at Kanopy.

Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum Attracts Millions of Visitors, Boosting Travel to Japan - Travel And Tour World", "body": "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has achieved a record number of visitors in fiscal 2023, with 1,981,617 people passing through its doors. This surge in attendance has been attributed to the heightened global attention following the Group of Seven (G-7) summit held in the city and the release of the blockbuster film \"Oppenheimer,\" which focuses on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\nMuseum officials reported that the visitor count for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 has surpassed previous records. The last highest attendance was recorded in fiscal 2016, following Barack Obama's historic visit as the first sitting U.S. president to Hiroshima, which drew over 1.73 million visitors. This record was briefly broken again in fiscal 2019 when the museum's main building reopened after a two-year renovation, attracting more than 1.75 million visitors.\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, established in 1955, serves as a poignant reminder of the devastation caused by the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Its exhibits and educational programs aim to promote peace and raise awareness about the consequences of nuclear warfare.\n\nThe record attendance in fiscal 2023 is believed to be influenced significantly by the G-7 summit, which brought international leaders to Hiroshima in May 2022. The summit's media coverage included images and reports of world leaders visiting the museum and signing the guestbook, drawing global attention to the museum and its mission.\n\nMoreover, the global success of \"Oppenheimer\" has also played a crucial role. The film, which chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb, opened in Japan in March 2023, eight months after its U.S. release. Despite the controversies surrounding the scientist's legacy, the film has sparked renewed interest in the history of nuclear weapons and Hiroshima's role in it.\n\nShiro Tani, vice chairman of the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation, noted the significant impact of media and movies on visitor numbers. \"Many foreign visitors I speak with mention 'Oppenheimer,'\" he said, highlighting the film's influence on the museum's international appeal.\n\nA visitor from the neighboring city of Higashi-Hiroshima, who toured the museum with his wife in February, mentioned the G-7 summit as a motivating factor. \"I decided to come partly because of the summit,\" said the man in his 40s. \"It was heartbreaking. I wonder what the G-7 leaders saw and how they felt.\"\n\nGiuseppe Gorgone, a 25-year-old tourist from Italy, expressed that he visited the museum due to its relevance to current global conflicts. He drew parallels between Hiroshima's past and the ongoing situation in war-torn Gaza, emphasizing the enduring importance of the museum's peace message amidst threats of nuclear weapon use by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nThe record attendance figures were also bolstered by a rebound in tourism following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. By the end of December, the number of foreign visitors to the museum had hit a record high, facilitated by the weak yen, which made Japan a more attractive destination for international tourists.\n\nA volunteer guide at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where the museum is located, observed a noticeable increase in visitors from outside the prefecture since the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. This resurgence in tourism has contributed significantly to the museum's record-breaking year.\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum's rise in visitors underscores its role as a crucial educational and cultural institution. The museum's exhibits provide a comprehensive look at the events leading up to the atomic bombing, the immediate aftermath, and the long-term effects on the city's residents and environment. It also serves as a platform for promoting global peace and nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe museum's record attendance in fiscal 2023 highlights the growing global interest in learning about the impacts of nuclear weapons and the importance of peace education. It also reflects the museum's successful efforts in engaging a broader audience through strategic initiatives and collaborations.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with conflicts and the threat of nuclear proliferation, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum's mission remains more relevant than ever. The recent surge in visitors is a testament to the museum's enduring appeal and its vital role in fostering understanding and empathy across cultures.\n\nLooking ahead, the museum plans to continue its efforts in expanding educational programs and international outreach, ensuring that the lessons of Hiroshima are passed on to future generations. The record-breaking attendance in fiscal 2023 sets a promising precedent for the museum's ongoing contributions to global peace and education.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

It features music, dance, poetry, theater, speeches, and the ritual launching of candle-lit lanterns on the water.\n\n\"The event has grown tremendously,\" said Shikuma, this year's emcee, who also performs with the Seattle Kokon Taiko drumming group, \"from a few hundred people and lanterns, to over 1,000 lanterns now and 1,500-2,000 people.\n\n\"We have expanded our focus from just remembering Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and preventing nuclear war, to include all wars and then any forms of violence. We have also had fewer speeches and more arts and culture in the program.\"\n\nOne of this year's performances, a dance entitled \"Kintsugi\" (\"joining with gold\"), comes from the Tsuru Ko dance troupe, led by local dancer and choreographer Gabrielle Nomura Gainor.\n\nThe new dance piece, said Gainor, \"honors all ancestors impacted by nuclear weapons, including hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors). The musical score includes the recorded voices of two survivors: Izumi Hirano and Jack Dairiki, as well as Nobuko Miyake-Stoner, child of survivors. These interviews were collected by Densho. The recorded interviews are interspersed with music by Paul Kikuchi and Kishi Bashi.\n\n\"Kintsugi is a centuries-old art form that embraces the beauty of human flaws. Broken pottery pieces are joined together with a lacquer mixed with powdered gold. This art form shows wholeness can be found even after rupture, brokenness, or pain.\n\nKintsugi is a reminder of the resilient hibakusha, people who survived an experience meant to kill them, and who experienced great stigma in their society. And yet, the stories of hibakusha are key for us to learn from. I cherish their courageousness and their stories. I deeply wish to honor these survivors.\"\n\nThirty years of \"Hope\" gave Stan Shikuma plenty of stories to recount.\n\n\"Memories of bringing my children when they were young, seeing their joy and satisfaction in lighting and launching their paper lanterns on the lake. I also remember the year my son was asked to speak as the youth voice for the program. No bad memories -- well, a few years when it rained, we had to cover the drums in plastic bags to protect the heads from the water.\n\n\"One year, we launched lanterns in Frosh Pond on the UW campus and dropped them in from the edge -- but when it was time to retrieve them, we suddenly realized just how far down the water was from the sides of the pond. Over three feet, which made it really difficult to pull the lanterns out of the water, and put us at great risk of falling into the pond as we reached way over to grab them.\"\n\nThis year's ceremony has a sad incident hanging over it: The theft, from Seattle's Peace Park, of the long-standing statue of Sadako Sasaki, a little girl who survived the Hiroshima bombing and later folded a thousand origami paper cranes, in the name of peace.\n\n\"We will mention the theft prominently in the program and urge people to work for the restoration of the statue,\" Shikuma said.\n\nAsked about what they hope people take away from the gathering, Gainor emphasized emotional concerns.\n\n\"I hope to lift peoples' spirits and remind them of the resilience of the human spirit. I hope to capture the emotion and deep love and respect for atomic bomb survivors and for our ancestors who perished in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n\"Their stories inspire me to speak out for victims of violence and war around the world -- including the more than 34,000 people from Gaza who have died to date.\"\n\nShikuma took a wider view.\n\n\"We always hope that people will look at peace more seriously and hold it more dearly. We hope that everyone walks away with good memories and a full heart, a bit more ready to face injustice in the world and a bit more likely to stand with others who have been wronged.", "source": {"uri": "nwasianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Asian Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kintsugi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lantern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lake_(Seattle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Lake (Seattle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crane (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_ceremonies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of ceremonies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Choreography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacquer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lacquer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumi,_Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izumi, Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Izumi, Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Park_(Seattle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peace Park (Seattle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadako Sasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orizuru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orizuru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/From-Hiroshima-to-Hope_F.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 178, "textEnd": 184}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

She was 3 years old when she was exposed to the atomic bomb. This year, she told Akinobu to attend the peace memorial ceremony instead of her. \"You should go this time because I can't endure the extreme summer heat,\" she said.\n\nThey both want to tell Hiroyuki's story to the next generation.\n\nHiroyuki, who was then 12 years old and a first-year student at a middle school in Hiroshima, was exposed to the atomic bomb only about 500 meters from the hypocenter.\n\nHe was working as a mobilized student at the time and suffered severe burns and lost his eyesight. A neighbor found him screaming \"please take me home,\" and carried him on a stretcher to his home, a temple on the outskirts of the city.\n\nWhen Hiroyuki's mother Masako gave him canned peaches, he said, \"Delicious.\" He died shortly after.\n\nUntil her death 15 years ago, Masako seldom talked to her family about the bombing, and she had put away photos of him somewhere she did not disclose.\n\nMutsuko was at the temple when the bomb exploded and was unhurt. However, she has no memory of the moment. Nevertheless, she decided to give her testimony about her brother in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. \"There was no one else but me who can tell the story of my brother to prove he really existed,\" she said.\n\nFortunately, an account by Masako about her son's final days, as told in an interview with a TV station in Hiroshima, had survived in book form.\n\nMutsuko repeatedly read the book and would speak at schools in Yamanashi Prefecture, where she had moved after getting married.\n\nShe has continued to give testimonies even after suffering a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2014, but recently her strength has lessened and her voice has become weak\n\nAkinobu did not know what his uncle looked like until 2013, when he visited Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims during a family trip to Hiroshima.\n\nWhen he saw a board indicating that the memorial hall registered pictures of A-bomb victims, he thought that since his uncle's name was a bit unusual, he might be able to find a photo of Hiroyuki.\n\nAkinobu searched the name on the touch screen and then a picture of Hiroyuki, a young face of a boy wearing a school cap, appeared. It is not clear by whom and under what circumstances the photo was registered. Still, Akinobu was deeply moved by the realization that his uncle had actually lived and his life had ended at the age of 12 in Hiroshima.\n\nWhen Mutsuko asked Akinobu to attend the ceremony, he agreed without hesitation, believing that now it is his time to tell the story.

An overwhelmingly high percentage of Americans -- 85 percent -- answered \"yes.\" That level of approval has gone down over the years, with (depending on the precise wording of the question) only a slim majority (57 percent in 2005) or a large minority (46 percent in 2015) voicing approval in more recent polls.\n\nThis reduction in atomic bombing approval over time has been cited as evidence of a gradual normative change in public ethical consciousness, the acceptance of a \"nuclear taboo\" or what Brown University scholar Nina Tannenwald has called \"the general delegitimation of nuclear weapons.\" This common interpretation of US public opinion, however, is too simplistic. Disapproval has indeed grown over time, but most Americans remain supportive of the 1945 attacks, albeit wishing that alternative strategies had been explored. These conclusions can be clearly seen in the results of a new, more complex public opinion survey, conducted for this article, that asked a representative sample of Americans about their views on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, examined alternative strategies for ending the war, and provided follow-on questions to determine how the public weighs the costs and benefits of different strategies. Scratch beneath the surface, and the American public today, as in 1945, does not display an ethically based taboo against using nuclear weapons or killing enemy civilians, but rather has a preference for doing whatever was necessary to win the war and save American lives.", "source": {"uri": "cisac.fsi.stanford.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "cisac.fsi.stanford.edu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/1200x630/public/2024-08/640px-upshot-knothole_climax_001.jpg?itok=IXztszat", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

People will gather to honor the victims and survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan, which occurred 79 years ago.\n\nOn Sunday, August 11, at 11 a.m., a commemoration ceremony will be held at the World Peace Bell in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. People will gather to honor the victims and survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan, which occurred 79 years ago. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first nuclear weapon ever used in warfare on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a second nuclear bomb was detonated over Nagasaki. The devastation was immense. In both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, over 200,000 people died from the bombing, and by the end of 1945 a further 200,000 had succumbed to injury and radiation poisoning. The long-term effects on survivors and their descendants have been profoundly traumatic and continue to this day.\n\nThose who survived, known as hibakusha, continue to call for the nuclear weapon states, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and Israel to disarm completely.\n\nIn January 2024, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists retained the doomsday clock at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to the theoretical armageddon since its inception in 1947. They stated that there is an 'undiminished nuclear threat and new arms race'.\n\nUnder the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and China are required to disarm completely. Yet, despite their commitments, there has been little progress toward disarmament. The nuclear-armed states currently possess an estimated 12,512 nuclear weapons -- about 12,512 too many. Each of these weapons is exponentially more powerful and destructive than those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nIn addition to their destructive capacity, these weapons are also extremely costly. In 2022, nuclear-armed states spent approximately $82.9 billion on their arsenals, amounting to more than $157,000 per minute. This represents an increase of $2.5 billion from 2021.\n\nWe know the devastation these weapons can cause. We have seen it in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and felt the ramifications across subsequent generations. We know it from the deliberate exposure of people in the Pacific Ocean | Te Moana Nui a Kiwa to nuclear testing. Our veterans exposed to these tests know it. Their children and grandchildren know it.\n\nAotearoa New Zealand has stood alongside those impacted, campaigning and advocating for global disarmament to protect our world. Along with like-minded states and the exceptional advocacy of civil society, we have made nuclear weapons illegal under international law. We can take pride in our global leadership in this effort and must continue to champion disarmament. By learning from the past, we can create a safer future, ensuring that no one ever again experiences the trauma endured by the hibakusha 79 years ago.\n\nCr Celeste Donovan, Christchurch City Councillor (Keynote)\n\nMr Ken Nakamura, Japanese Consul\n\nDr Susan Bouterey, University of Canterbury Associate Professor (Japanese)\n\n11:45 Public invited to ring World Peace Bell and place flowers on River Avon\n\nAbout the Disarmament and Security Centre:\n\nThe Disarmament and Security Centre (DSC) is a not-for-profit charitable organisation based in Aotearoa New Zealand. The DSC was established in 1998 in Christchurch and today operates as primarily a virtual Centre connecting disarmament experts, lawyers, political scientists, academics, teachers, students and disarmament proponents. The DSC provides a resource centre for alternative thinking on disarmament and security issues, both within Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally. Currently the work focuses on: reinvigorating public awareness on disarmament issues by implementing the recommendations from the 2002 United Nations Study on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Education; educating about New Zealand's nuclear free legislation; informing the public on the World Court's 1996 Advisory Opinion on nuclear weapons and its implications; raising awareness of the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the fallacies of nuclear deterrence; and offering safer alternative security strategies.\n\nFor more information visit www.disarmsecure.org",

The best thing that this generation of politicians can do to honour the memory of those that were killed and protect the lives of future generations is to ensure that we finally abolish nuclear weapons for good.\n\n\"I truly hope that we soon see the day when Scotland can disarm our waters and join the many other nations around the world who have already signed the nuclear weapon ban.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Prohibition_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(UK_nuclear_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trident (UK nuclear programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child benefit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790613", "eventUri": "eng-9790613", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

People will gather to honor the victims and survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan, which occurred 79 years ago. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first nuclear weapon ever used in warfare on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a second nuclear bomb was detonated over Nagasaki. The devastation was immense. In both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, over 200,000 people died from the bombing, and by the end of 1945 a further 200,000 had succumbed to injury and radiation poisoning. The long-term effects on survivors and their descendants have been profoundly traumatic and continue to this day.\n\nThose who survived, known as hibakusha, continue to call for the nuclear weapon states, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and Israel to disarm completely.\n\nIn January 2024, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists retained the doomsday clock at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to the theoretical armageddon since its inception in 1947. They stated that there is an 'undiminished nuclear threat and new arms race'.\n\nUnder the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and China are required to disarm completely. Yet, despite their commitments, there has been little progress toward disarmament. The nuclear-armed states currently possess an estimated 12,512 nuclear weapons -- about 12,512 too many. Each of these weapons is exponentially more powerful and destructive than those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nIn addition to their destructive capacity, these weapons are also extremely costly. In 2022, nuclear-armed states spent approximately $82.9 billion on their arsenals, amounting to more than $157,000 per minute. This represents an increase of $2.5 billion from 2021.\n\nWe know the devastation these weapons can cause. We have seen it in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and felt the ramifications across subsequent generations. We know it from the deliberate exposure of people in the Pacific Ocean | Te Moana Nui a Kiwa to nuclear testing. Our veterans exposed to these tests know it. Their children and grandchildren know it.\n\nAotearoa New Zealand has stood alongside those impacted, campaigning and advocating for global disarmament to protect our world. Along with like-minded states and the exceptional advocacy of civil society, we have made nuclear weapons illegal under international law. We can take pride in our global leadership in this effort and must continue to champion disarmament. By learning from the past, we can create a safer future, ensuring that no one ever again experiences the trauma endured by the hibakusha 79 years ago.\n\nCr Celeste Donovan, Christchurch City Councillor (Keynote)\n\nMr Ken Nakamura, Japanese Consul\n\nDr Susan Bouterey, University of Canterbury Associate Professor (Japanese)\n\n11:45 Public invited to ring World Peace Bell and place flowers on River Avon\n\nAbout the Disarmament and Security Centre:\n\nThe Disarmament and Security Centre (DSC) is a not-for-profit charitable organisation based in Aotearoa New Zealand. The DSC was established in 1998 in Christchurch and today operates as primarily a virtual Centre connecting disarmament experts, lawyers, political scientists, academics, teachers, students and disarmament proponents. The DSC provides a resource centre for alternative thinking on disarmament and security issues, both within Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally. Currently the work focuses on: reinvigorating public awareness on disarmament issues by implementing the recommendations from the 2002 United Nations Study on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Education; educating about New Zealand's nuclear free legislation; informing the public on the World Court's 1996 Advisory Opinion on nuclear weapons and its implications; raising awareness of the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the fallacies of nuclear deterrence; and offering safer alternative security strategies.\n\nFor more information visit www.disarmsecure.org",

I felt sorry for those who died. I knew I needed to talk about it, but I didn't want to.\"\n\nOther survivors who have spoke out since have described the injured as \"walking ghosts\" with two thirds of the city reduced to rubble.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki - which was bombed three days later on August 9 - were the first and only time nuclear weapons have been deployed at war.\n\nThe double blow ended World War 2 but its use has long been a controversial talking point globally.\n\nSome argue by ending the war the bomb saved more lives in the long term.\n\nJapan ultimately surrendered days later meaning the US wasn't forced to invade and extend the bloody battles further.\n\nOthers remain adamant that the bomb with such a long lasting impact could never be justified due to the number of civilians killed.\n\nYasujiro Tanaka was three when the bomb went off over Nagasaki - and even now he remembers the blast first detonating.\n\nHe describes the moment as a \"million camera flashes going off at once\".\n\nTanaka was left buried in the wreckage of his home - with his injuries leaving him with radiation burns, deaf in one ear and with a misshapen face.\n\nHis mother was left with glass shards growing out of her skin for years to come before the long-embedded shards were finally pushed out - ending the torment.\n\nMasakatsu Obata also survived the Nagasaki bombing revealed seeing a coworker with his skin \"melted off\" and bodies and faces swollen to \"one and a half times the size\".\n\nFurther nightmares were told to TIME with Taeko Terame saying the city became a \"sea of fire\" as voices cried out for help.\n\n\"I began to choke on the consequent smoke -- poisonous gas, it seemed like -- and vomited uncontrollably,\" she said.\n\nFor the now retired Saiki, his reason for finally speaking out coincides with his growing fears of a repeat nuclear disaster.\n\nHe feels Vladimir Putin's terrifying onslaught on Ukraine and his incessant thirst for domination is pushing Europe closer to an all out war.\n\nWith the possibility of an atomic blast being unleashed again ever the more likely.\n\nThe Japanese native was diagnosed with stomach cancer six years ago meaning now was the time to speak up.\n\nSaiki, who went to work for a local TV station, warned: \"People around the world don't know the misery of nuclear weapons.

Hidehiko Yuzaki at a ceremony to mark 79 years since the 1945 atomic bombing of the city.\n\n****\n\nOn this day, in marking the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, on behalf of all people of Hiroshima Prefecture, I wish to offer my humble and sincere prayers for the souls of those who lost their lives in the atomic bombing. I would also like to extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families and express my heartfelt sympathies to the hibakusha, the atomic bomb survivors, who even today suffer from the aftereffects of the bomb.\n\nThe atomic bombing brought about unparalleled devastation. This historic fact pierces our hearts deeply because of the testimonies of the hibakusha about the hellish anguish they had experienced. Even though it was unbearable for them to recall such memories, they have continued to describe the misery, driven by a strong aspiration that no one else should suffer it. At present, 79 years after the bombing, we are losing hibakusha one by one. To pass on their last words to the next generation, we take various initiatives.\n\nThe other day, I had the opportunity to visit the Aoyakamijichi site in Tottori Prefecture, an archaeological site where a great many remains of people in the Yayoi period in Japan's prehistoric age have been excavated. There, I saw arrowheads stuck deep in skulls and hipbones, all vividly illustrating the cruelty of battles. These wounds made me ponder about the life of the people living in those days, which were not always peaceful.\n\nAt present, we still see wars in various parts of the world. The strong defeat the weak. The weak are trampled down. In contemporary wars, men and women, young and old, are shot by bullets or torn into pieces by missiles, rather than by arrowheads and swords. Great powers, which are expected to protect international order established by the United Nations, overtly attempt to invade other countries by violating international laws and changing the status quo by force. This is the reality that humans have continued to see since the prehistoric age.\n\nIn this context, so-called realists suggest a policy of \"force for force\" and \"a nuclear weapon for a nuclear weapon.\" When they suggest this policy, however, they deliberately ignore another piece of reality or the fact that once people invented a weapon, they used it without exception. Chemical weapons, for example, have continued to be used even though their use is banned. As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday.\n\nWe must become genuine realists. Nuclear weapon abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future. Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival.\n\nDespite this fact, only limited resources are invested in initiatives for nuclear weapon abolition, including intellectual, human, and financial resources. On the other hand, in the single year of 2023, more than 14 trillion yen (about US$95.5 billion) was invested in maintaining and increasing nuclear weapons and building related strategies. Moreover, tens of thousands of people were involved in such programs serving as consultants, members of military forces and governments, scientists, and engineers.\n\nTo all in the world who can face reality, what we must do is to allocate much more resources to related initiatives in order to truly realize the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Please imagine, if we invest just 10% of the budget for maintaining and increasing nuclear weapons, that is, 1.4 trillion yen and thousands of specialists, in the total elimination of nuclear weapons, this will surely make a major advancement toward nuclear weapon abolition.\n\nI would now like to introduce the words of a researcher in Okinawa.* She mentioned her own experience of burning her fingers by mistake. She got a terrible blister, which almost deformed her fingers. While writhing in pain, she thought of the exceptional pain of the people who had been exposed to the radiation of the bombing and wondered if she had understood the magnitude of their pain correctly. Some hibakusha had blisters on their faces that made it impossible for them to be identified, and others wandered about with their eyeballs and stomachs popped out. Even when we severely burn our own fingers, can we truly imagine the pain of the hibakusha?\n\nI cannot bear losing any more hibakusha, who have tried to pass on their memories of pain and suffering to us, while humanity has remained unconcerned and silent about the existence of nuclear weapons.\n\nOn this day, we must remember once again the following pledge: \"For we shall not repeat the evil.\"\n\n* Ronko 2024 Dareka no itami wo bokyaku shinai (Discussion 2024: Never forget the pain of someone else) by Yoko Uema (pedagogist and professor at the University of the Ryukyus) quoted in

Read and reflect with subject experts and boost your chance of cracking the much-coveted UPSC CSE. In the following article, Aakanksha Jha explores the historical context of the world's first atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945.)\n\nThe first atomic bomb codenamed 'Little Boy' was dropped over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, obliterating the Japanese city of its 70,000-80,000 souls. The atomic weapon, used by the US for the first time on an enemy target during WWII, caused immense loss and unprecedented destruction. Its effect is still being felt today.\n\nEvery year, on August 6, Hiroshima Day is observed to remember the tragic anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city. On its 79th anniversary, let's see how the horrifying bombing underlines the significance of the commitment to build a safer world.\n\nPrelude\n\nDuring WWII, for the first time in the recorded history of mankind, fission properties of radioactive elements were used to create a weapon of mass destruction. The gun-type device with a uranium core was released over Hiroshima by a B-29 bomber named Enola Gay on August 6. Three days later, on August 9, the US dropped a second atomic bomb, \"Fat Man,\" on another Japanese city Nagasaki.\n\nThis was a rather grim end to the escalation caused by Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939. The second edition of the Great War was known for the clash of personalities and ideologies. Dictatorial regimes of Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini in Italy, Gen. Hideki Tojo in Japan, Antonio Salazar in Portugal, Juan Peron in Argentina, and Francisco Franco in Spain were against the Allied nations consisting of Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nThe Axis powers represented totalitarian dictatorial regimes with absolutist ideals whereas the Allied Powers were committed to the new modern sensibilities of self-determinism, democratic form of government, anti-racialism, etc. However, the question remains as to why the need for dropping the atomic bomb on Japan was felt even after Germany surrendered in May of 1945 and Italy way back in Sept of 1943.\n\nAttack on Pearl Harbour\n\nThe answer perhaps lies in the deep waters of the Pacific. After the surrender of Italy and Germany, the theatre of war had shifted to the Pacific Ocean between unlikely enemies - the US on the Hawaiian Islands and the unrelenting Japanese on the Western Pacific.\n\nIt was a surprise Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor on Oahu Island, Hawaii on December 7, 1941 that brought war to the shores of the US.\n\nThe base was attacked by 353 Japanese Imperial Air Force planes, killing 2,404 US military and civilian population. This led to a deep military crisis between the US and Japan.\n\nThe first half of 1945 was uncharacteristically fierce between Japanese and US militaries. A general call of chronology fails to explain the use of atomic bombs. In February 1945, the US invaded the Japanese islands of Iwo Jima and captured it after suffering 30,000 casualties.\n\nIn April 1945, the US invaded the Japanese island of Okinawa at the cost of about 50,000 casualties. But Japan lost its larger vestiges of Air Force and Navy due to retaliatory strikes by the US. All these were done while progress was ongoing in the Manhattan Project.\n\nManhattan Project\n\nOn the morning of July 16, 1945, in the arid swathes of White Sands Missile Range of Alamogordo, New Mexico, Robert Oppenheimer exclaimed and quoted the Gita saying, \"Now I have become death\". The famous scientist, widely known as the 'father of the atomic bomb', cited the line in view of the successful detonation of a plutonium device nicknamed 'Gadget'. His words were recorded by Project General L.R. Groves in a memorandum submitted to the War Secretariat.\n\nThe success of the project gave an added advantage to the US military arsenal. Ideas were now debated in the diplomatic circles of allies as to how to use this newfound weapon. Subsequently, on July 26, the Big Three Allied forces, i.e. the US, Britain and the Soviet Union gathered at Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam, Germany. They issued an ultimatum for Japan and asked for its unconditional surrender.\n\nAs per the military archives of the US, several other options were discussed before the decision to detonate atomic bombs was reached. This included either a demonstration of the bomb off the coast of Tokyo with minimal damage or a full-scale invasion of the Japanese Island code-named Olympia in October 1945. It was, however, the personal experience of former US President Henry Truman that also acted as a catalyst in the decision.\n\nJapan's response to the Potsdam declaration\n\nTruman participated in the First World War and suffered heavily in France as a soldier. He lost his sons and nephews in the Second World War. What weighed in his mind was also the legacy of former President Franklin Roosevelt who talked of 'unconditional surrender' as the first prerequisite for lasting peace.\n\nHence, after a thorough permutation and combination of probabilities, the Truman administration authorised the use of Atomic weapons anytime after August 3, 1945. This came after Japan neglected and remained cold to the Potsdam declaration.\n\nNorman Cousins, an American political journalist commented in his oft-cited essay 'Modern Man is obsolete' on the beginnings of Nuclear War. This shaped the way forward for the next diplomatic task of disarmament, de-escalation and establishing a new world order.\n\nIndia and nuclear disarmament\n\nTo date, as per the United Nations data, about 13,400 nuclear weapons reportedly remain in our vicinity with over 2,000 tests conducted worldwide. The first attempt towards disarmament was made in 1946, which established a Commission to deal with problems related to the discovery of atomic energy and its peaceful use in the United Nations General Assembly. Since then, several nuclear disarmament structures and forums have come into existence.\n\nThese include the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, also known as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was signed in 1963 but has yet to enter into force, and the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).\n\nIndia participates in the Geneva-based Conference of Disarmament and remains committed to the goal of global, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament. India keeps up the demand for internationally verified Fissile Material Cut off Treaty.\n\nIndia's reservation to NPT and CTBT along with TPNW remains one of the most decisive policy decisions. To date, the NPT signed in 1968 recognises only the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the US, Russia, the UK, France and China) as nuclear weapon powers and mandates that other countries can be a party to the NPT only as a non-nuclear weapon state. This was and is principally against the security and integrity of the nation and the sovereign right to defend itself.\n\nIndia has pledged to continue with its voluntary and unilateral moratorium on further nuclear testing. It is the only nuclear weapon state to declare that it believes its security would be enhanced, not diminished, in a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nHiroshima Peace Memorial\n\nThe Genbaku Dome ruins perhaps need our sobering attention as we reflect on the disasters of Nuclear War. The industrial promotion centre at Hiroshima took the barrage of atomic radiation directly overhead. Almost the whole city turned into dust but the industrial complex remains intact.\n\nNow known as the 'Hiroshima Peace Memorial', Genbaku in Japanese means atom bomb. History came full circle when former US President Barack Obama visited Hiroshima, Genbaku Dome on May 27, 2016 and met a Hibakusha survivor, i.e. a survivor of the atomic attack on Hiroshima. Entering new atomic nomenclature in the Japanese dictionary and the atomic radiation in the genes of many Japanese men and women are the starkest living archives of human war history.\n\nPost Read Question\n\nWhy is Hiroshima day recalled as the horrific day in the history of humankind?\n\nDiscuss the prelude to the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWhat are the geopolitical implications of WWII? How did it bring about a paradigm shift in the international order?\n\nHow does the Hiroshima day underline the significance of nuclear disarmament? Discuss the stand of India in the global nuclear order.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attack on Pearl Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Tojo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Tojo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun-type fission weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasion of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benito Mussolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Humans were reduced to charcoal and survivors cried out for help in vain.\n\nThree years later, Mitsue is still riddled with guilt for having abandoned her father in the nuclear inferno and denies her own romantic feelings for a young man she has come to know.\n\n\"I should have died with my dad,\" she tells herself.\n\nJust for this one play, Inoue collected a vast amount of research materials. At Chihitsudo Bunko, Inoue's personal library, there is a volume titled \"Hiroshima-ken Hogen Jiten\" (Dictionary of Hiroshima Prefecture dialect).\n\nI visualize Inoue with a highlighter pen in hand, marking numerous words and phrases while trying to imagine how the daily lives of countless people were brought to an abrupt end by the atomic bomb.\n\nAmong the numerous words he highlighted were \"otottan\" (father) and \"ohiisan\" (the sun).\n\nAnd Inoue is said to have perused literally hundreds of personal accounts written by hibakusha survivors and hand-copied passages into his own notebook.\n\nHe recalled in an essay, \"I copied them, mumbling to myself hundreds of times, 'Oh, you sorrowful words, may you spread all over the world.'\"\n\nThe play was first performed in 1994. Over the last 30 years, it has been also staged overseas many times.\n\nBut the path to the elimination of nuclear weapons still remains long and arduous. In fact, the goal seems to have moved further away.\n\nInoue is gone. And there are only few hibakusha left now to tell their stories. Still, I believe we must keep walking.\n\nThe play ends with the father encouraging Mitsue to live her life for his sake, too.\n\nHe says in the Hiroshima dialect, \"Surely, your job is to tell people about human sorrow and happiness.\"\n\nThe baton has been passed to his daughter, to me as a journalist, and to all of us who are living now.\n\nCicadas are singing.

This day serves as a solemn reminder of the use of a nuclear weapon during the conflict between the United States and Japan, resulting in the devastating loss of life and the destruction of the city of Hiroshima. The far-reaching effects of the atomic bomb continued to impact the generations that followed, leading to extensive loss of infrastructure and a prolonged period of suffering and death for many individuals. Enola Gay, the B-29 Bomber, was used by the United States of America on August 6, 1945, to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Let us learn more about the Enola Gay bomber and what happened to it after the bombing.\n\nPilot Paul Tibbets named the Enola Gay, B-29 Superfortress, after his mother. Enola Gay underwent significant modifications to prepare for a critical mission in 1945. Stripped of everything but the necessities, it was made thousands of pounds lighter than an ordinary plane.\n\nThe B-29, first flown in 1942, quickly gained popularity in the Pacific theatre during World War II. In 1944, it was chosen to carry the atomic bomb, leading to various modifications, including reinforcements of the bomb bay.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Tibbets, a highly experienced B-29 pilot, assembled and trained a crew for this critical mission. The modified B-29s were transported to the US military base on Tinian, one of the Mariana Islands, where they awaited their historic duty.\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the United States successfully tested the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. President Harry S Truman, attending the Potsdam Conference, received the news of the successful test. In response, he informed Soviet leader Joseph Stalin that the United States had \"a new weapon of unusual destructive force.\" Following this, on July 26, 1945, in the Potsdam Declaration, the Allied leaders, including Truman, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, and Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, called for Japan to surrender or face \"prompt and utter destruction unconditionally.\"\n\nAfter Japan ignored the demand for unconditional surrender, the decision was made to proceed with the use of the atomic bomb. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped \"Little Boy\" on Hiroshima, leading to widespread destruction and loss of life. This event marked the first time an atomic bomb had been used in warfare, and it had a significant impact on the course and outcome of World War II.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, around 2.45 am, Colonel Tibbets and his crew of 11 took off from Tinian island aboard the Enola Gay, a plane carrying a uranium bomb nicknamed \"Little Boy\".\n\nAs they soared above the city of Hiroshima at approximately 8.15 am, the bomb was released and detonated, resulting in widespread destruction and the loss of tens of thousands of lives.\n\nTibbets later received the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the mission. Following this, the Enola Gay also participated in weather reconnaissance for the bombing of Nagasaki before Japan's official surrender on September 2, 1945.\n\nEnola Gay continued to serve for several years before being transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1949. However, due to extensive damage caused by exposure to the elements, vandalism, and bird nests, the aircraft underwent a 20-year restoration project starting in 1984.\n\nIn 1995, a portion of the plane was displayed in a contentious exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington, D.C. The initial plans for the exhibit, which included artefacts from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were met with strong opposition and were eventually scaled back.\n\nFinally, in 2003, the fully restored Enola Gay found its permanent display location at the NASM's Steven F Udar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nAnd as long as it is on display, the questions it raises will likely persist. After all, they have been associated with the Enola Gay since it first gained widespread attention.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devika_kapoor@news9live.com", "name": "Devika Kapoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enola Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tibbets", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Tibbets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Roosevelt (D).\n\nHawaii has since become a favored vacation spot of Japanese citizens who diligently tour most of the islands' famous sights with their Japanese tour guides, but they were notably absent from the Pearl Harbor memorial; very few ever of them visit, my tour guide explained.\n\nIn contrast, many Americans visit Hiroshima, where 79 years ago today on August 6, 1945, after all other desperate efforts by winning Americans to end the deadly war that followed Pearl Harbor against the losing Japanese, who were suicidally determined to continue the deadly war, then-president Harry S. Truman, after much soul searching and some opposition, authorized dropping the atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in an effort to spare more American and Japanese lives. From Truman's own words:\n\nWe are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake; we shall completely destroy Japan's power to make war.\n\nIt was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum. If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\n\nWhen the stubborn Japanese still wouldn't surrender, Truman authorized a second bomb on Nagasaki. The Japanese finally surrendered, sparing not only the lives of American armed forces personnel but also the further destruction of Japan. After Japan's capitulation, the U.S. occupied Japan and reformed its government, turning it into the prosperous, very peaceful country it is today. However, (some) Americans, forgetting their U.S. history, visit Hiroshima and its \"peace\" memorial, to apologize to some unrepentant Japanese. An example of this mixed message is the statement. delivered by former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and now U.S. Ambassador to Japan on the 79th anniversary of Hiroshima, just a few days back:\n\n'For nearly 80 years, the city of Hiroshima has been an enduring symbol of peace and possibility, and its people a powerful symbol of healing and hope. Emerging from the ashes of tragedy and suffering, the city is a shining beacon of resilience and unity for the entire world,' said Ambassador Emanuel.\n\n'It is both my honor to attend the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony and my duty to ensure that we never forget the lessons the city and its citizens teach us. With each visit I make to Hiroshima, I feel evermore determined to continue to strengthen the bonds of friendship and alliance between the United States and Japan. Far from forgetting the past, we can use it to motivate and inspire us in our shared pursuit of peace and prosperity in the region and across the world.'\n\nHopefully the Japanese will now visit the Pearl Harbor Memorial. Hopefully.\n\nHopefully Americans will learn the lessons of peace through strength. Hopefully.\n\nMay the memories of World War II veterans remain eternal.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_National_Memorial", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pearl Harbor National Memorial"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

How could they?\"\n\nAs the number of people who survived the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki rapidly dwindles 79 years after the attacks, hibakusha -- the Japanese word for the survivors -- and others are imploring humanity to do everything possible to avert another nuclear war.\n\n\"People still don't get it. The atomic bomb isn't a simple weapon. I speak as someone who suffers until this day: The world needs to stop nuclear war from ever happening again,\" Shigeaki Mori, who was an 8-year-old boy on his way to school on the morning of August 6, 1945, toldThe New York Times. \"But when I turn on the news, I see politicians talk about deploying more weapons, more tanks. How could they? I wish for the day they stop that.\"\n\nKeiko Aguro was also 8 years old and standing on a road near her home in Hiroshima when a U.S. B-29 Superfortress dropped one bomb over Hiroshima that exploded with the force of 16 kilotons of TNT. The explosion destroyed nearly everything and everyone within about a 1-mile (1.62 km) radius. As many as 90,000 people died from the heat, blast wave, and ensuing inferno. Tens of thousands of others were injured, many of them mortally. Tens of thousands more would perish from radiation over the following weeks, months, and years.\n\n\"As survivors, we cannot do anything but tell our story,\" Aguro said. \"'For we shall not repeat the evil' -- this is the pledge of survivors. Until we die, we want to tell our story, because it's difficult to imagine.\"\n\n\"Now what survivors worry about is to die and meet our family in heaven,\" Aguro added. \"I heard many survivors say, 'What shall I do? On this planet there are still many many nuclear weapons, and then I'll meet my daughter I couldn't save. I'll be asked: Mom, what did you do to abolish nuclear weapons?' There is no answer I can tell them.\"\n\nThree days after Hiroshima, Nagasaki was obliterated in a 20-kiloton air burst that killed as many as 75,000 people that day, with a similar number of people wounded and tens of thousands more dying later from radiation.\n\nThe authors of the Times piece -- Kathleen Kingsbury, W.J. Hennigan, and Spencer Cohen -- wrote that \"as another anniversary of August 6 passes, it is necessary for Americans -- and the globe, really -- to listen to the stories of the few human beings who can still speak to the horror nuclear weapons can inflict before this approach is taken again.\"\n\nHowever, they note that \"countries like the United States, China, and Russia are spending trillions of dollars to modernize their stockpiles,\" while \"many of the safeguards that once lowered nuclear risk are unraveling and the diplomacy needed to restore them is not happening.\"\n\n\"The threat of another blast can't be relegated to history,\" the trio wrote. But they added that nearly eight decades later, many Americans still hail the bombings as \"necessary and heroic acts that brought the war to an end.\"\n\nBut the prevailing U.S. historical narrative -- which portrays the bombings as critical to ending the war -- ignores the lack of consensus and grave misgivings among senior military commanders about dropping the bombs. Seven of the eight five-star generals and admirals at the time opposed its use. One of them, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, later said as president that \"the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.\"\n\nThe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) -- which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for its work on the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons -- marked this year's ignominious anniversary with a report focusing on how children are affected by nuclear war and the threat thereof.\n\nThe report contains graphic descriptions of the effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, and of nuclear weapons testing on children around the world. It also explains how fear of thermonuclear annihilation affected children during the Cold War and how humanity can protect children by disarming.\n\n\"Today, several thousand nuclear weapons still exist in the arsenals of nine countries, posing a unique existential threat to people everywhere, especially children. Many have vastly greater explosive yields than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\" the ICAN report states.\n\n\"To protect humanity from the catastrophic harm that nuclear weapons are designed to inflict, governments must act with urgency to eliminate them completely -- the only guarantee against their further use and testing,\" the publication continues. \"This would be a great service to the current generation of children and to all future generations, who would grow up free from the threat of nuclear war.\"\n\n\"The alternative is to pass on to them a world still teetering on the brink of catastrophe,\" ICAN added. \"Or, quite unthinkable, a world reeling from the horrors of another nuclear attack, perhaps with a death toll orders of magnitude greater than that of the atomic bombings of 1945.\"\n\nEchoing ICAN, Hiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki said during the annual commemoration of the bombing at Hiroshima Peace Park that \"as long as nuclear weapons exist, they will surely be used again someday.\"\n\n\"Nuclear weapons abolition is not an ideal to achieve far in the future,\" Yuzaki stressed. \"Instead, it is a pressing and real issue that we should desperately engage in at this moment since nuclear problems involve an imminent risk to human survival.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hibakusha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blast wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT equivalent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing B-29 Superfortress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air burst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Campaign_to_Abolish_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagasaki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidehiko_Yuzaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hidehiko Yuzaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of magnitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapons testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Japan marked the anniversary of atomic bombing on the western city of Hiroshima on Tuesday, people from across the nation gathered to protest the government's accelerated arms build-up, urging it to stick to peace.\n\nAt Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park where a memorial ceremony on the 79th anniversary of the bombing was held, protesters vented their anger over Japan-US military alliance and called on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to step down, while holding banners reading no war and no nuclear weapons.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian envoy: US-Japan alliance posing nuclear threats to neighbors\n\nRyo Miyahara, head of a Hiroshima citizens' group and the protest's organizer, told Xinhua that there was growing risk of nuclear war as Japan-US military alliance was strengthening.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian strategic bombers conduct routine flight over Sea of Japan\n\nYasuhiro Ikanda said that his father told him about the devastating scene of the bombing, and it was a betrayal of bombing victims as the Japanese and US governments were working on nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe Japanese government uttered words of opposing nuclear weapons, but it indeed significantly increased defense spending, expanded arms production and export, and turned Okinawa into a military fortress, he said.\n\nJapan has not truly reflected on its aggressive war, and bombing victims continue to seek accountability of its war crime, Ikanda said.\n\nREAD MORE: US upgrades military command in Japan\n\nJapan brutally invaded and occupied many parts of Asia before and during World War II, inflicting untold suffering and heavy casualties on millions of innocent victims.\n\nThe atomic bombing of Nagasaki followed the one dropped on Hiroshima, with both bombings a means of accelerating the end of World War II and forcing Japan to surrender.\n\nREAD MORE: China ready to move toward establishing East Asian community\n\nWhile Japan inwardly looks at the bombings it had experienced at the end of World War II, historians and political minds of the international community have encouraged Japan to come to see themselves not as merely victims of the atomic bombings but also as the perpetrators who led to these tragic incidents to happen in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tied 7-7 late in the second quarter, the No. 1 Black Bears scored five unanswered goals before halftime on their way to a 17-11 victory over No. 8 Morse in a Class C quarterfinal Saturday morning at the Ricky Gibson Field of Dreams. Maranacook/Winthrop (14-1) will host its divisional final game Wednesday against the winner of No. 4 Wells vs. No. 5 Erskine Academy. Sophomore Celia Bergdahl and freshman Stella Stewart led the Black Bears with four goals each, while freshman Cooper Davis and senior Ashley Deschamp each added three goals. Senior Olive Beeton led the Shipbuilders (6-9) with five goals while Zoe Avery and Lillian Pomerleau each had two goals. Maranacook/Winthrop jumped out to a quick lead in the first quarter. But Morse, playing shorthanded due to injuries, clawed back, as Beeton and Avery each scored two goals to cut the Black Bears lead to 6-4. Beeton and Pomerleau added goals early in the second quarter, and thanks to a score from Liz Bingham, the Shipbuilders tied the Black Bears 7-7. \u201cWe knew we had to mark a couple (Morse players),\u201d Bergdahl said. \u201cWe knew from the prior game things we needed to improve on and fix for this game. So we worked on those during practice during the week and it definitely helped us.\u201d Morse gave the Black Bears one of their toughest games all season, a 7-5 win for Maranacook/Winthrop on May 15. \u201c(Morse) match up really well with us,\u201d Maranacook/Winthrop head coach Zach Stewart said. \u201cThere were a bunch of teams in the playoffs I\u2019d rather play instead of Morse. They played hard all game long and did things really well. They\u2019re well coached. We just happen to be on the (winning) side of the scoreboard today, which is a testament to these girls and their grit and tenacity.\u201d Maranacook/Winthrop found another gear, tallying five goals in the following five minutes. Bergdahl and Davis each scored two goals, while Deschamp added a score, eventually giving the Black Bears a 13-8 halftime lead. They never lost the lead again. \u201cCoach always talks about possession and possessing the ball,\u201d Deschamp said. \u201cAt the end (of the half), we knew (Morse) was going to pressure us. He told us \u2018Take (the shot) if you have it.\u2019 But we always say, \u2018Take the ball for 2 1/2 seconds, see if anyone is open, see if you can go and if not, pass it off.\u2019 We just worked on that.\u201d Morse continued to fight throughout the second half, but couldn\u2019t overcome the deficit. \u201cI\u2019m very proud, and we had it at (7-7) at one point, but we let it get away from us,\u201d Morse head coach Linda Levesque said. \u201cMaranacook is a good team, they put pressure in transition and made us play fast. The kids gave it their all, and what more can you really ask for?\u201d Maranacook/Winthrop has now won 10 straight since its 12-9 loss to Class B Brunswick on May 4. In that stretch, the Black Bears have scored 142 goals, an average of 14.2 goals per game. It\u2019s the sixth straight game they\u2019ve scored 10 goals or more. \u201cA lot of us know our roles (on offense) and are very good at our roles,\u201d Deschamp said. \u201cWe know who\u2019s going to get the ground balls, we know who\u2019s going to be looking for the cut and who is going to be cutting. We\u2019ve really come to as a team this year.\u201d Comments are not available on this story. \u00ab Previous", "summary": "Black Bears score five unanswered goals late in first half to pull away from Shipbuilders.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/06/08/class-c-girls-lacrosse-first-half-surge-key-for-maranacook-winthrop-in-quarterfinal-win-over-morse/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Unknown-rotated-1-1717866347.jpeg?w=480", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:05:51", "author": "Dave Dyer", "authors": ["Dave Dyer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.009}

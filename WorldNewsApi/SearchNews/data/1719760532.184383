In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence has propelled into the mainstream - sparking endless debate about its safety and potential ability to steal our jobs and livelihoods. But it's not all doom and gloom, and AI is already being used to try and better the world. In fact, the technology is already being deployed to try and support radiologists in identifying breast cancer in its early stages where the disease would have otherwise gone undetected. Google has been working on its AI system since 2017, and recently launched an 'AI overview' feature for people using the search feature. However, there has been some pretty questionable advice given out... Internet analyst Jeremiah Johnson went viral this week after creating a thread on X of alleged responses AI overview gave following its debut. When searching the term 'cheese not sticking to pizza', the bot reportedly responded: \"Cheese can slide off pizza for a number of reasons, including too much sauce, too much cheese, or thickened sauces.\" Sounds pretty reasonable, right? Well, the bot continued: \"Here are some things you can try: Mixing cheese into the sauce helps add moisture to the cheese and dry out the sauce. You can also add about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue to the sauce to give it more tackiness.\" The thread also claims AI overview said doctors recommend smoking 'two-three cigarettes per day during pregnancy' and that it's 'absolutely normal' for cockroaches to 'crawl into your penis hole'. When asked 'how many rocks shall I eat' the system reportedly said: \"According to geologists at UC Berkeley, you should eat at least one small rock per day.\" Yummy!

Google responded to the fallout, stating: \"The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high-quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web. Many of the examples we\u2019ve seen have been uncommon queries, and we've also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn't reproduce.\" Do you have a story to share?

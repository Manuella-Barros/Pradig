Solid. Of course, I could have done better, I think, on return games, but also credit to him for serving very well, for changing things up.\"\n\nIt's been a rougher-than-usual season so far for Djokovic, and while there were some signs of breaking out of his 2024 funk during the course of the contest at Court Philippe Chatrier, he still has room for improvement as he attempts to become the first player in tennis history to claim 25 Grand Slam singles trophies. There's no doubt he cares about such things.\n\n\"Grand Slams are the ones that are basically getting me up from the bed every day. Knowing that I have to hit the practice courts, I always think about what I can do in Grand Slams,\" he said. \"So here I am. Hopefully I can have another deep run.\"\n\nThat's what Herbert expected to see.\n\n\"I knew, from the beginning,\" Herbert said, \"that I'm going to have in front of me the 'Novak of the Grand Slams.' ... It's just the intensity of concentration.\"\n\nDjokovic is a three-time title winner at Roland Garros who needs to return to the final to retain his No. 1 ranking. But he arrived in Paris without having done that at any tournament this year. He is 0-3 in semifinals -- including a loss last week at the lower-tier Geneva Open on red clay -- and this victory across 2 1/2 hours only served to make his overall record 15-6.\n\nSo when he spoke at a news conference on Sunday, Djokovic described his mindset heading into the French Open this way: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\" Then he pointed out, \"Anything but a title, for me, is not satisfactory,\" which is understandable given his remarkable resume.\n\n\"In the moments when it mattered, I think I delivered. Played a great tiebreak. Stayed focused,\" Djokovic said about Tuesday's performance. \"I'm glad that I started the way I started, the way I felt on the court. Comparing to the previous weeks of tournaments I played, I felt good. Better. So I'm moving in a positive direction. Yeah, it's just the beginning.\"\n\nHe seemed a bit edgy at moments against Herbert, a 33-year-old Frenchman who owns a career Grand Slam in doubles but never has been past the third round at any major in singles and is currently ranked 142nd.\n\nThe home crowd tried to push Herbert, repeatedly calling out his name, even imploring him in English at one point by chanting, \"Let's go, Pierre-Hugues! Let's go!\" They jeered Djokovic late in the third set when he went to the sideline to towel off after he slipped, stumbled and tumbled onto the clay chasing a ball.\n\nA day after sitting in the Chatrier stands to watch rival Rafael Nadal's first-round loss against Alexander Zverev, Djokovic was competing in the chill of a 60-degree evening (15 Celsius), and he did not always look happy. He rolled his head back after one miss while making four groundstroke mistakes to get broken early in the second set. He repeatedly gestured to ballkids to give him tennis balls so he could prepare to serve.\n\nAlthough Herbert's game did not demand a maximum expenditure of energy from Djokovic, there certainly was enough to keep things interesting. And by the end, the winner totals were 37 for Herbert, 29 for Djokovic.\n\nThere were some strokes of brilliance from Djokovic, to be sure, and he covered the court well when sprinting after the drop shots Herbert kept trying. The highlight for Djokovic was probably the closed-stance sliding backhand winner that earned him a match point -- which was converted when Herbert double-faulted to end it.\n\nStill, the statistic that truly mattered was the one that shows Djokovic is now 69-0 in opening matches at Slam events since starting his career with a 3-2 mark in first-rounders.\n\nDjokovic's second-round opponent will be 63rd-ranked Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain.\n\nThe first round closed on a day during which rain delayed play for several hours early in the day on all but the two principal courts, which are outfitted with retractable roofs.\n\nOther winners Tuesday included the man Djokovic beat in last year's French Open final, Casper Ruud, and past major champions Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina.\n\nRuud, who also was the runner-up to Nadal in Paris in 2022 and leads the ATP with 36 wins in 2024, beat Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka overpowered Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina beat Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3.\n\nSabalenka is trying to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"I'm just trying to separate myself from all those facts,\" said Sabalenka, who is No. 2 in the rankings behind Iga Swiatek. \"I mean, I know that if I'll be able to focus on myself and I'll be able to fight for every point and try to find a solution in each game, I will be able to win these big tournaments. But I just try to take it step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Tom Nouvian contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Hugues_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Hugues Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Meligeni_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Meligeni Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greet_Minnen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greet Minnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/5/28/novak-djokovic-1-2127374-1716934060159.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605847", "eventUri": "eng-9605847", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

Christophe Ena/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Ignore the straight-set score: Novak Djokovic was not quite at his impervious best in the first round of the French Open on Tuesday night, and his 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4 win over Pierre-Hugues Herbert might not have been enough to alter the defending champion's \"low expectations\" at this tournament.\n\nIt's been a rougher-than-usual season so far for Djokovic, and while there were some signs of breaking out of his 2024 funk during the course of the contest at Court Philippe Chatrier, he still has room for improvement as he attempts to become the first player in tennis history to claim 25 Grand Slam singles trophies.\n\nDjokovic is a three-time title winner at Roland Garros who needs to return to the final to retain his No. 1 ranking. But he arrived in Paris without having done that at any tournament this year. He is 0-3 in semifinals - including a loss last week at the lower-tier Geneva Open on red clay - and this victory across 2 1/2 hours only served to make his overall record 15-6.\n\nSo when he spoke at a news conference on Sunday, Djokovic described his mindset heading into the French Open this way: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\" Then he pointed out, \"Anything but a title, for me, is not satisfactory,\" which is understandable given his remarkable resume.\n\nPerhaps that's why Djokovic seemed a bit edgy at moments against Herbert, a 33-year-old Frenchman who owns a career Grand Slam in doubles but never has been past the third round at any major in singles and is currently ranked 142nd.\n\nThe home crowd tried to push Herbert, repeatedly calling out his name, even imploring him in English at one point by chanting, \"Let's go, Pierre-Hugues! Let's go!\" They jeered Djokovic late in the third set when he went to the sideline to towel after he slipped, stumbled and tumbled onto the clay chasing a ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA day after sitting in the Chatrier stands to watch rival Rafael Nadal's first-round loss against Alexander Zverev, Djokovic was competing in the chill of a 60-degree evening, and he did not always look happy. He rolled his head back after one miss while making four groundstroke mistakes to get broken early in the second set. He repeatedly gestured to the ballkids to go ahead and give him the balls already so he could prepare to serve.\n\nAlthough Herbert's game did not demand a maximum expenditure of energy from Djokovic, there certainly was enough to keep things interesting. And by the end, the winner totals were 37 for Herbert, 29 for Djokovic.\n\nThere were some strokes of brilliance from Djokovic, to be sure, and he covered the court well when sprinting after the drop shots Herbert kept trying. The highlight for Djokovic was probably the closed-stance sliding backhand winner that earned him a match point - which was converted when Herbert double-faulted to end it.\n\nStill, the statistic that truly mattered was the one that shows Djokovic is now 69-0 in opening matches at Slam events since starting his career with a 3-2 mark in first-rounders.\n\nDjokovic's second-round opponent will be 63rd-ranked Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain.\n\nThe first round closed on a day during which rain delayed play for several hours early in the day on all but the two principal courts, which are outfitted with retractable roofs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther winners Tuesday included the man Djokovic beat in last year's French Open final, Casper Ruud, and past major champions Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina.\n\nRuud, who also was the runner-up to Nadal in Paris in 2022 and leads the ATP with 36 wins in 2024, beat Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka overpowered Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Rybakina beat Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3.\n\nSabalenka is trying to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

But he arrived in Paris without having done that at any tournament this year. He is 0-3 in semifinals -- including a loss last week at the lower-tier Geneva Open on red clay -- and this victory across 2 1/2 hours only served to make his overall record 15-6.\n\nSo when he spoke at a news conference on Sunday, Djokovic described his mindset heading into the French Open this way: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\" Then he pointed out, \"Anything but a title, for me, is not satisfactory,\" which is understandable given his remarkable resume.\n\nPerhaps that's why Djokovic seemed a bit edgy at moments against Herbert, a 33-year-old Frenchman who owns a career Grand Slam in doubles but never has been past the third round at any major in singles and is currently ranked 142nd.\n\nThe home crowd tried to push Herbert, repeatedly calling out his name, even imploring him in English at one point by chanting, \"Let's go, Pierre-Hugues! Let's go!\" They jeered Djokovic late in the third set when he went to the sideline to towel after he slipped, stumbled and tumbled onto the clay chasing a ball.\n\nA day after sitting in the Chatrier stands to watch rival Rafael Nadal's first-round loss against Alexander Zverev, Djokovic was competing in the chill of a 60-degree evening (15 Celsius), and he did not always look happy. He rolled his head back after one miss while making four groundstroke mistakes to get broken early in the second set. He repeatedly gestured to the ballkids to go ahead and give him the balls already so he could prepare to serve.\n\nAlthough Herbert's game did not demand a maximum expenditure of energy from Djokovic, there certainly was enough to keep things interesting. And by the end, the winner totals were 37 for Herbert, 29 for Djokovic.\n\nThere were some strokes of brilliance from Djokovic, to be sure, and he covered the court well when sprinting after the drop shots Herbert kept trying. The highlight for Djokovic was probably the closed-stance sliding backhand winner that earned him a match point -- which was converted when Herbert double-faulted to end it.\n\nStill, the statistic that truly mattered was the one that shows Djokovic is now 69-0 in opening matches at Slam events since starting his career with a 3-2 mark in first-rounders.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nDjokovic's second-round opponent will be 63rd-ranked Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain.\n\nThe first round closed on a day during which rain delayed play for several hours early in the day on all but the two principal courts, which are outfitted with retractable roofs.\n\nOther winners Tuesday included the man Djokovic beat in last year's French Open final, Casper Ruud, and past major champions Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina.\n\nRuud, who also was the runner-up to Nadal in Paris in 2022 and leads the ATP with 36 wins in 2024, beat Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka overpowered Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina beat Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3.\n\nSabalenka is trying to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nAssociated Press Writer Tom Nouvian contributed to this report.\n\nAP

Solid. Of course, I could have done better, I think, on return games, but also credit to him for serving very well, for changing things up.\"\n\nIt's been a rougher-than-usual season so far for Djokovic, and while there were some signs of breaking out of his 2024 funk during the course of the contest at Court Philippe Chatrier, he still has room for improvement as he attempts to become the first player in tennis history to claim 25 Grand Slam singles trophies. There's no doubt he cares about such things.\n\n\"Grand Slams are the ones that are basically getting me up from the bed every day. Knowing that I have to hit the practice courts, I always think about what I can do in Grand Slams,\" he said. \"So here I am. Hopefully I can have another deep run.\"\n\nDjokovic is a three-time title winner at Roland Garros who needs to return to the final to retain his No. 1 ranking. But he arrived in Paris without having done that at any tournament this year. He is 0-3 in semifinals -- including a loss last week at the lower-tier Geneva Open on red clay -- and this victory across 2 1/2 hours only served to make his overall record 15-6.\n\nSo when he spoke at a news conference on Sunday, Djokovic described his mindset heading into the French Open this way: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\" Then he pointed out, \"Anything but a title, for me, is not satisfactory,\" which is understandable given his remarkable resume.\n\n\"In the moments when it mattered, I think I delivered. Played a great tiebreak. Stayed focused,\" Djokovic said about Tuesday's performance. \"I'm glad that I started the way I started, the way I felt on the court. Comparing to the previous weeks of tournaments I played, I felt good. Better. So I'm moving in a positive direction. Yeah, it's just the beginning.\"\n\nHe seemed a bit edgy at moments against Herbert, a 33-year-old Frenchman who owns a career Grand Slam in doubles but never has been past the third round at any major in singles and is currently ranked 142nd.\n\nThe home crowd tried to push Herbert, repeatedly calling out his name, even imploring him in English at one point by chanting, \"Let's go, Pierre-Hugues! Let's go!\" They jeered Djokovic late in the third set when he went to the sideline to towel off after he slipped, stumbled and tumbled onto the clay chasing a ball.\n\nA day after sitting in the Chatrier stands to watch rival Rafael Nadal's first-round loss against Alexander Zverev, Djokovic was competing in the chill of a 60-degree evening (15 Celsius), and he did not always look happy. He rolled his head back after one miss while making four groundstroke mistakes to get broken early in the second set. He repeatedly gestured to ballkids to give him tennis balls so he could prepare to serve.\n\nAlthough Herbert's game did not demand a maximum expenditure of energy from Djokovic, there certainly was enough to keep things interesting. And by the end, the winner totals were 37 for Herbert, 29 for Djokovic.\n\nThere were some strokes of brilliance from Djokovic, to be sure, and he covered the court well when sprinting after the drop shots Herbert kept trying. The highlight for Djokovic was probably the closed-stance sliding backhand winner that earned him a match point -- which was converted when Herbert double-faulted to end it.\n\nStill, the statistic that truly mattered was the one that shows Djokovic is now 69-0 in opening matches at Slam events since starting his career with a 3-2 mark in first-rounders.\n\nDjokovic's second-round opponent will be 63rd-ranked Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain.\n\nThe first round closed on a day during which rain delayed play for several hours early in the day on all but the two principal courts, which are outfitted with retractable roofs.\n\nOther winners Tuesday included the man Djokovic beat in last year's French Open final, Casper Ruud, and past major champions Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina.\n\nRuud, who also was the runner-up to Nadal in Paris in 2022 and leads the ATP with 36 wins in 2024, beat Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka overpowered Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina beat Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3.\n\nSabalenka is trying to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"I'm just trying to separate myself from all those facts,\" said Sabalenka, who is No. 2 in the rankings behind Iga Swiatek. \"I mean, I know that if I'll be able to focus on myself and I'll be able to fight for every point and try to find a solution in each game, I will be able to win these big tournaments. But I just try to take it step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Tom Nouvian contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Meligeni_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Meligeni Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greet_Minnen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greet Minnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/_ethEnjDygztif7wa3t9Lw3A7fA=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/BMCDWU7HOBP6ZPI2GQOAF4UKLA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605847", "eventUri": "eng-9605847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic needed 2 hours and 31 minutes to outclass the World No. 142 and local hero 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4 in front of a packed Philippe-Chatrier crowd in Paris.\n\nNovak Djokovic was made to work hard in the second set as Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a former top 40 player, raised his game and put pressure on the Serb. While Djokovic breezed through the first set after converting a break early in the match, the 24-time Grand Slam champion was in a spot of bother when he dropped serve and was dragged to a tie-breaker. Djokovic, however, raised his game in the second-set tie-breaker, winning it with ease.\n\nDjokovic let out a roar after the second set tie-breaker, acknowledging the fact that he was made to work hard. Pierre-Hugues Herbert did not throw in the towel as he kept fighting in the third set and was level at 3-3. However, Djokovic pulled away and broke Herbert's serve when the Frenchman was serving to stay in the match.\n\nDjokovic, who had to wait until the third day to get his campaign going in Roland Garros, will be delighted with the first-round test. Notably, Djokovic was in the stands at the Philippe-Chattrier on Monday to watch Alexander Zverev's first-round win over 14-time champion and the King of Clay -- Rafael Nadal.\n\nDjokovic on Tuesday thanked the late evening crowd for staying back and cheering the two players on the court. The 24-time Grand Slam champion extended his record to 72 out of 74 matches in the first round of Grand Slam tournaments. It was also Djokovic's 2nd win over Herbert as he continued his perfect run against the Frenchman, who showed signs of improvement.\n\nDjokovic will face Spain's World No. 63 Roberto Carballes Baena in the second round. Baena defeated Constant Lestienne of France in his first-round match in four sets on Tuesday.\n\nDjokovic will be looking to shake off his recent form and go all the way and win his fourth Roland Garros crown.

It's been a rougher-than-usual season so far for Djokovic, and while there were some signs of breaking out of his 2024 funk during the course of the contest at Court Philippe Chatrier, he still has room for improvement as he attempts to become the first player in tennis history to claim 25 Grand Slam singles trophies. Djokovic is a three-time title winner at Roland Garros who needs to return to the final to retain his No. 1 ranking. But he arrived in Paris without having done that at any tournament this year. He is 0-3 in semifinals - including a loss last week at the lower-tier Geneva Open on red clay - and this victory across 2 1/2 hours only served to make his overall record 15-6. So when he spoke at a news conference on Sunday, Djokovic described his mindset heading into the French Open this way: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\"\u009d Then he pointed out, \"Anything but a title, for me, is not satisfactory,\"\u009d which is understandable given his remarkable resume. Perhaps that's why Djokovic seemed a bit edgy at moments against Herbert, a 33-year-old Frenchman who owns a career Grand Slam in doubles but never has been past the third round at any major in singles and is currently ranked 142nd. The home crowd tried to push Herbert, repeatedly calling out his name, even imploring him in English at one point by chanting, \"Let's go, Pierre-Hugues! Let's go!\"\u009d They jeered Djokovic late in the third set when he went to the sideline to towel after he slipped, stumbled and tumbled onto the clay chasing a ball. A day after sitting in the Chatrier stands to watch rival Rafael Nadal's first-round loss against Alexander Zverev, Djokovic was competing in the chill of a 60-degree evening (15 Celsius), and he did not always look happy. He rolled his head back after one miss while making four groundstroke mistakes to get broken early in the second set. He repeatedly gestured to the ballkids to go ahead and give him the balls already so he could prepare to serve. Although Herbert's game did not demand a maximum expenditure of energy from Djokovic, there certainly was enough to keep things interesting. And by the end, the winner totals were 37 for Herbert, 29 for Djokovic. There were some strokes of brilliance from Djokovic, to be sure, and he covered the court well when sprinting after the drop shots Herbert kept trying. The highlight for Djokovic was probably the closed-stance sliding backhand winner that earned him a match point - which was converted when Herbert double-faulted to end it. Still, the statistic that truly mattered was the one that shows Djokovic is now 69-0 in opening matches at Slam events since starting his career with a 3-2 mark in first-rounders. Djokovic's second-round opponent will be 63rd-ranked Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain. The first round closed on a day during which rain delayed play for several hours early in the day on all but the two principal courts, which are outfitted with retractable roofs. Other winners Tuesday included the man Djokovic beat in last year's French Open final, Casper Ruud, and past major champions Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina. Ruud, who also was the runner-up to Nadal in Paris in 2022 and leads the ATP with 36 wins in 2024, beat Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka overpowered Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2, and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina beat Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3. Sabalenka is trying to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam. ___ Associated Press Writer Tom Nouvian contributed to this report. ___ AP tennis:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Hugues_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Hugues Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Meligeni_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Meligeni Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greet_Minnen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greet Minnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medicinehatnewslogo-square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605847", "eventUri": "eng-9605847", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Hasn't even reached a final. His schedule has been lighter than usual, and so has his record, which was just 14-6 entering the French Open.\n\nSo this is how he framed his outlook for Roland Garros on Sunday: \"Low expectations and high hopes.\"\n\nDjokovic started the tournament off victoriously Tuesday, sweeping 142nd-ranked Frenchman Pierre-Hughues Herbert 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4. He next plays 63rd-ranked Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena.\n\nJust how low are his expectations? Well, this is Novak Djokovic we're talking about -- the owner of 24 Grand Slam titles, including his third in Paris a year ago, and more time at No. 1 than any player in the history of the computerized rankings -- so his definition of that phrase differs greatly from pretty much anyone else's.\n\nFRENCH OPEN DRAWS: Men | Women | Broadcast Schedule\n\n\"It's tough to talk about. It's very subjective. I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are. Anything but a title for me is not satisfactory. It always has been like that,\" Djokovic said Sunday. \"It might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up.\"\n\nSure does. Which is why Djokovic, who turned 37 last Wednesday, probably figures what has been going on this year does not necessarily mean he can't turn it on when it counts the most. And why other players, such as two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud, agree with that assessment.\n\n\"To me, even though Novak hasn't had the best year as he typically has, or the same level, I think he is still the favorite,\" Ruud said. \"He is the No. 1 seed, and he has 24 Slams under his belt, so if there's anyone who knows when to find their peak and form, it's probably him.\"\n\nDjokovic is coming off a loss in the semifinals at the Geneva Open, a lower-tier event that he normally would never enter on the eve of a major. He said after that defeat that he had stomach problems.\n\nBefore that came a second-round loss at the Italian Open -- and a bizarre episode in which a spectator's water bottle conked him in the head after a match -- which was preceded by a semifinal setback against Rudd at Monte Carlo.\n\nIn all, Djokovic is 0-3 in semifinals this season -- he was beaten at that stage by Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open -- and this is only the second time since Djokovic won his first ATP title in 2006 that he has entered the French Open without getting to least one final anywhere.\n\nHe's taken some time off, too, missing tournaments in Miami and Madrid, for example.\n\nOn Saturday, he alluded in a vague way to off-court matters that have affected him in 2024, saying only that there were \"various things that were happening in the last couple of months, but I don't want to get into it. I hope you understand that. It's just I don't want open Pandora's Box and talk about things.\"\n\nAs for the source of the \"high hopes\" he mentioned Sunday?\n\n\"I would say that I know what I'm capable of, and particularly in the Grand Slams, I normally play the best tennis -- at least I aim always to play the best tennis -- and I was most of my career able to do that, so that's the goal,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It does affect me, the five months that I had so far in the year that haven't been great in terms of my tennis,\" he acknowledged. \"That's why I have kind of an approach that is focused on a daily basis more trying to build the form and momentum, so that I can have a better chance to reach further in the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b3e914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2250+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Feb%2F1b%2Fc44865ac44efbe3b954653e64475%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2155057681", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605847", "eventUri": "eng-9605847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Thanks for reading and please join us throughout the tournament for further live blogs.\n\nMore from Novak Djokovic: \"Herbert served extremely well, he gave me a lot of difficulties. I couldn't find the right position on the return. When I stepped back, he would serve and volley. He was doing very well to mix up the rhythm, I thought it was good tennis from my side. On my service games, I did everything I needed to do so I'm pleased with the performance.\"\n\n\"On clay, you have to deliver the goods and be physically fit, ready to go in long exchanges. Of course it's becoming tougher for me but I'm still enjoying myself. Out of all the clay court tournaments, this is by far my favourite: the way I'm playing the ball and feeling on the court. Hopefully I can keep it going in the right direction.\"\n\nSpeaking to Santoro, he said about his victory: \"That's the thing I can control: my concentration. I think Pierre served very, very well with a high quality in the second and third set too. I was in a bit of a complicated situation because I didn't find the right position to return.\n\n\"So it was important to stay focused, because if he had won that second set, it would have been a different game: for the public, for us, for the atmosphere. It was important in the tiebreak to be there, present and I think I played my best tennis when it mattered the most.\"\n\nOn what it means to be back at Roland Garros: \"It's a full stadium, so it was incredible, the ambience. I played against a Frenchman, so it's normal for the atmosphere to be rousing like that. But after twelve months, it's really special to return to this court. I've had a lot of big battles and matches in recent years. I managed to win Roland Garros, I know for me, it's maybe the biggest challenge I've had in my career. It was always a big mountain to climb.\"\n\nOn watching the Nadal v Zverev round one match on Monday night:\n\n\"As Rafael had said on the court last night afterwards, he didn't know whether it would be his last game here, but all the history he's made here will maybe never be forgotten in the future of our sport. So, I've a great respect for him, what he's done in this sport but particularly on this court. Congratulations to him for an incredible career.\"\n\nThat was probably just about what Novak Djokovic needed: to be pushed a little bit and be forced to go through the gears, while still coming out on top in straight sets. It wasn't convincing, but he got the job done.\n\nHe speaks to Fabrice Santoro afterwards - well, he asks for the first question again, given the rapid-fire French, before answering fluently in that tongue. Props to the polyglot. Just give me a few minutes to translate what they've said...\n\nMeanwhile, Briton Katie Boulter is 3-2 down in the deciding set against Paula Badosa. In the balance.\n\nAfter a game that ebbed and flowed, the pick of the whole set, Novak Djokovic wins as his opponent double faults.\n\nDjokovic went two points from victory after an earlier Herbert double fault, but the Frenchman profited from a mishit return which didn't kick up. As Herbert sends him to the net rushing for a drop shot, he loses his balance and falls onto the clay, necessitating a T-shirt change.\n\nAt deuce, Djokovic found a ridiculous angle, getting down so low to find a way down the left tramline. Unplayable.\n\nA shame to finish with a double fault, but Pierre-Hugues Herbert showed some glimpses of fine play. No shame in losing to a player who bestrides the sport.\n\nGround strokes from the gods, as Djokovic moves Herbert around left and right.\n\nHis harried opponent dollies up a lob which the Serbian gratefully smashes away to make it 30-0 on the way to another service hold to love. Herbert will serve to stay in the match.\n\nHerbert, who I've decided looks like an older Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, finishes his hold of serve with a rasping serve that pings off Djokovic's racquet and ends up in Row P.\n\nA quick hold for the 37-year-old this time. They're not messing about, no breaks of serve in the third set yet.\n\nHerbert has got fight in him and wins his service game to love. No dramas. And he's had his fair share this year: his four-month-old son Leandre was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism, a rare genetic disease, necessitating weeks spent in hospitals and a 10-hour surgery on his pancreas. Happily, it led to recovery.\n\n\"Leandre is cured and that's already our biggest victory of 2024,\" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nHigh-quality tennis from this pair, as Djokovic booms down a smash to go 40-30 up. He has a laser death stare for someone who shouted out while he was about to hit it.\n\nThe umpire reminds the crowd to stay quiet during the point. The Serbian rounds off the game and the disturbance is forgotten.\n\nTalk about erratic from Herbert, but he's still in this match.\n\nHe starts with two aces, but dumps some shots into the net to go 30-40 down. After finding a vicious, deep serve at the right time to bring it to deuce, he double faults then serves another ace. Finally, he sends over his delightful one-handed slice backhand drop shot to level things up in the fourth set.\n\nAfter some protracted rallies and long games in the second set, Djokovic is back in racing mode. He holds his serve to love.\n\nThe defending champion is in the groove and wants that break, but is left mumbling away to himself and looking up at his box. Herbert went 0-30 down after a dynamite drop stop, but came back firing with some lethal kick serves. If he'd lost that game, one feels it would have been over very quickly.\n\nDjokovic is getting back on top here, winning the opening game to love. As he changes racquets, he looks more settled and satisfied.\n\nDjokovic wins the second set. He went up through the gears exactly when he needed to, a hallmark of his play over time.\n\nHe brought up four set points with more Herbert errors, partly brought about by his own relentless pressure and accuracy. The French wild-card netted, and after a very competitive 66-minute set, Herbert is up against it. I can see Djokovic running away with this.\n\nWhat do you make of the match so far? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nHerbert gets off the mark as Djokovic pounds a forehand well long, but the Frenchman sends a couple of shots wide and goes a double mini-break down.\n\n\"Herbie!\" rings around Court Philippe-Chatrier again, more out of hope than expectation.\n\nThe first point goes astray, as the Frenchman lofts the ball long and then fires his next forehand into the net. After a long rally, Djokovic roars into the sky and pumps his fist after a delicate exchange at the net wrong-foots Herbert.\n\nThe Frenchman has done a lot to get to the tiebreak, but he is in danger of losing it limply. Djokovic is so disciplined and can just grind him down.\n\nNo sweat for Djokovic: he brings up a second-set tiebreak, holding to love.\n\nPierre-Hugues Herbert is having a lot of joy with his wide kick serve, but puts himself under pressure with two double faults to lead 40-30.\n\nHowever, Djokovic cannot exploit his errors: he gets moved around at the back of the court and sends his backhand wide. Herbert pumps his fist, and well he might: the man ranked 142nd in the world is guaranteed a tiebreak here and could test this legend of the sport as he serves to stay in this set.\n\nHold to love for Djokovic. The opening point was the finest, having Herbert on the run, up at the net straining for a drop shot and back beyond the base line with a lob. The Frenchman's subsequent netted tweener nevertheless delights the crowd on Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nHerbert double faults at 15-15, but shows his deftness at the net, getting down low to send a half-volley back past Djokovic, tricking him.\n\nA fine drop shot and volleyed lob has the Serbian in it at 40-30 down. Herbert bravely comes to the net and puts a strong Djokovic forehand into open court to deservedly lead this second set.\n\nThis isn't panic stations yet, not by a long stretch, but Djokovic looks unusually reserved as he goes through the motions and holds his serve in a tight game.\n\nHe opens his body to angle a forehead into the ad court, beating Herbert, but the Frenchman comes back, capitalises on a so-so second serve with his own to make it 30-30. A wide serve averts any possible trouble, but Herbert slices a sublime drop shot to bring up deuce. He's the one pumping his fist as the Parisian crowd roars, but he throws it away with a couple of errors.\n\nAh, there's the frustration as he turns to his box, says some words, gesticulates and grimaces.\n\nDjokovic isn't generating quite as much power as he usually does and his balance isn't on-point. He is looking a tad off-colour, as Herbert grows into this game. Djokovic sends a backhand long and Herbert wins the game to love.\n\nThat's nine unforced errors for the three-time Roland Garros winner already in this set, oof.\n\n\"Djokovic has gotten a little flat here. Not really moving as well as we normally see him. It looked to be in cruise control, at the moment, he's battling himself,\" says John McEnroe on the Eurosport commentary. \"Herbert might not get another chance as good as this.\"\n\nAs he says that, Djokovic double faults to go 15-15, but follows it up with his fourth ace of the match and has more than enough to run away with the sixth game of the second set.\n\nDjokovic charitably points out a mark on a line to show that the ball was good. The match has been played without any any rancour so far, there have been no histrionics or visible frustration from either player. Letting the tennis do the talking.\n\nIt's Herbert's turn to have a straightforward hold of serve to love, as Djokovic sprinkles in a few uncharacteristic unforced errors.\n\nStress-free hold for the pre-match favourite, and the pressure is back on Herbert.\n\nIt's one of the shots of the match from Herbert, a dazzler fired cross-court with his backhand after another tricky serve. Djokovic bashes back an unanswerable forehand down the line to stay in the game at 40-30. Highlights reel tennis, this.\n\nAnother drop shot from the Serbian and a close net exchange brings up deuce as he whips the ball past his opponent.\n\nPoor decision-making from Herbert brings up a break point, going back to Djokovic's forehand, and that's easy pickings, but he dashes it into the net after a patient rally. Herbert has the measure of him and closes the game out by coming to the net and stretching to dab a forehand into open court. This match is simmering nicely.\n\nWell, well, well, where did that come from? Herbert breaks back. He comes out fighting, earning two break points at 15-40. Djokovic sends a weak ball into the net and we're all square in the second set, unexpectedly.\n\nThe unforced error count after the opening set tells a story - two for Djokovic, 13 for Herbert in that opening set. The Frenchman missed plenty of balls and was moved around by his experienced opponent.\n\nThere haven't been many long rallies, but after sending another backhand astray, Herbert bides his time and then sends it down the line to make it 30-30 after a 21-shot exchange.\n\nDjokovic moves to break point after a fortunate net cord deflection loops over Herbert. He manoeuvres the Frenchman around at the back of the court and, under great pressure, Herbert is broken at the start of the second set.\n\nThe crowd rouses as Herbert takes the ball early and sends a silky forehead down the line off the second serve for 0-15. The doubles specialist has to show aggression like that if he's going to challenge Djokovic.\n\nOf course, it's about calculated risk: he comes into the net off the second serve, but his return is right down the Serb's throat and he passes him easily at the net for 30-15. When he takes on another second serve on the next point, his booming forehand sails out.\n\nNovak Djokovic seals the opening set as Herbert sends a forehand wide after returning his serve. Pretty straightforward so far.\n\nDjokovic is annoyed with himself and chunters away after sending a backhand limply into the net for 15-15. The favourite goes 15-30 up, but Herbert keeps it competitive, smashing down his third ace for 40-30. Djokovic hits another backhand into the net.\n\nThere's nothing Herbert can do as his decorated opponent rains down accurate first serves and wins the game to love.\n\nHerbert digs into his box of tricks and his one-handed backhand drop shot landing just over the net has the charging Djokovic beaten to make it 40-15. He pressures the net again to close out the game and the Serbian whacks it well out.\n\nDjokovic plays a poor drop shot and Herbert gets there, even after a stumble, to make it 0-15. The Philippe-Chatrier court start shouting \"Herbie! Herbie!\" The defending champion snuffs out any more partisan displays of affection, with a 202km/h serve right on the central service line.\n\nHerbert makes it 30-30 with a delicious lob over Djokovic at the net after his opponent had sent him into the corner, but sends a backhand long. The defending champion shows his pedigree, closing the game out with a pacey forehand just inside the tramline, which wrong-foots Herbert.\n\nHerbert bangs a serve down the central service line which has Djokovic stretching and sending his backhand return into the net to go 30-15. He ends it with his first ace.\n\nDjokovic gets in all his first serves and wins the game to love. That pleasing, flat forehand is in full evidence. He's putting Herbert under pressure and the Frenchman makes a couple of unenforced errors, which won't help his confidence.\n\nHerbert opens the third game with a double fault, eliciting some muttering from the home crowd. The 33-year-old needs all the help and accuracy he can get here.\n\nHis next serve just kisses the service line and he wafts a follow-up ball out. Under pressure, Herbert decides to play a decent drop shot 0-30 down and Djokovic still has the speed to get there, get down and put the ball past his opponent to gain three break points. The next point, Herbert comes to the net and makes no mistake, putting Djokovic under pressure.\n\nHowever, Djokovic gets the break with a pinpoint forehand down the left sideline. In the ascendancy and not out of second gear yet.\n\nDjokovic bangs down the match's first ace to make it 40-0. He kicks at the terre battue and bangs his shoes, then follows it up with another ace. Two straightforward holds, for starters.\n\nWhat a start from the Frenchman, winning the opener to love, moving Djokovic around and spraying a lovely forehand to the back of the court which left the 24-time slam champion flat-footed.\n\nHerbert starts strongly, wins the opening two points, with a couple of unforced errors from Djokovic.\n\nWhen he's on song, Herbert is a lot of fun to watch, fast around the court and no mug: he lost in three exciting sets to Carlos Alcaraz at the 2021 Paris Masters and lost in a fifth-set decider to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros four years ago. But he'll need to be at his best to pose any kind of threat to Djokovic.\n\nThe players walk out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier. The Parisian skies have cleared up after the afternoon's rain and the roof is open. Pierre-Hugues Herbert wins the coin toss and elects to serve.\n\nThe two have played each other once before, way back in 2013, when Djokovic beat Herbert 7-6, 6-3 at the Paris Masters. It's a battle of the oldies, as the pair have a combined age of 70. Herbert has never had a match of this magnitude in his singles career, he'll want to get off to a strong start to settle any nerves.\n\nFancy a flutter? Take a look at these French Open betting offers for the best free bets.\n\nYou don't just lose it overnight and the Serbian, who turned 37 six days ago, hasn't been dumped out in the first round of a slam since 2006. He should have more than enough quality to dispatch doubles doyen Herbert, who is a 20-1 shot with some bookmakers.\n\nBut he will be looking for a quick night's work to help start building some momentum at Roland Garros. If Herbert gets an early foothold in the match, the vociferous home crowd could lift him further.\n\nA serve-and-volleyer with a deft touch, Herbert has five men's doubles grand slam titles to his name, including two at Roland Garros. But he has performed erratically this year and is some way off his singles best, ranked 140th in the world. His career high was 36th back in February 2019.\n\nHe's the defending champion, the world No.1 and surely most people's favourite to win. But while all that is true, it's also fair to say that Novak Djokovic comes into this year's French Open with more question marks hanging over him than for many a year. That's not something lost on him, as after last week's chastening defeat to little-known Czech player Tomas Machac, his sixth loss of the year, he admitted he was 'worried'.\n\nThe only reason the 24-time grand slam winner played in Geneva was because he was searching for form, and he left with even more doubts. He said after his shock defeat last week that he doesn't feel confident.\n\n\"Of course I'm worried,\" said Djokovic, who had taken the uncharacteristic step of asking for a wild card into Geneva after an even more surprising loss in the third round of Rome. That one was against Alejandro Tabilo, a Canadian who plays under the Chilean flag.\n\n\"I haven't played well at all this year, apart from a few matches here and there. I don't see myself as a favourite in Paris.\n\n\"I didn't have a great night...It's not nice to suffer like that on the court. It's hard to concentrate on tennis when you have other things on your mind. I just hope to be ready and in good health for Roland Garros.\"\n\nAll in all it doesn't sound the most rousing, 'let's get down to business' speech. In fact it's more 'if I win, I win, if I lose, I lose' damp squib of a self-address, which isn't what you associate with the Serb.\n\nTo add to the sense that something is changing in the men's game, Nadal lost in the first round for the first time yesterday. His defeat to Alexander Zverev didn't come as a complete shock (he, like Djokovic, was out of form) but it does add to a changing-of-the-guard feel that Djokovic will be desperate to avoid this evening when he comes up against local favourite Pierre-Hugues Herbert.\n\nStay here to find out whether the defending champion can find his mojo and avoid a shock defeat.", "source": {"uri":

He is struggling badly for form, his support team has seen a significant upheaval and the 98-time ATP title winner still has not even reached a single final this season.\n\nBut he is still Djokovic, still the best player in the world over the past 52 weeks, meaning his presence alone marks him as one of the tournament favourites and a true force to be reckoned with. On Tuesday night, Djokovic began his title defence in the French capital with a hard-fought 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4 win over Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a French wildcard, to reach the second round as he continued his search for form.\n\nIt was not always easy. In front of a packed, partisan crowd furiously cheering on their own player, Djokovic struggled to summon his best tennis in Herbert's service games as the Frenchman admirably served well and kept Djokovic at bay with his wicked kick serve and forays into the net.\n\n\"Monte Carlo, Rome, and Geneva tournaments started really well for me,\" said Djokovic. \"First matches I played were great. Then second matches, third matches was quite different. So I don't want to get too excited.\n\n\"I thought it was a good performance for me, solid. Of course I could have done better, I think, on return games, but also credit to him for serving very well, for changing things up, for seeing every time I would step back for second serve, you know, give him a little bit different look, he would see that, he would come in.\"\n\nWhile Djokovic was still far from his best, with too many unforced errors off both groundstrokes during the second set, he was sharper in the decisive moments. From 5-6 in the second set, Djokovic won nine of the next 10 points, establishing a 5-1 lead in the tiebreak before easily seeing out the set. After struggling to break Herbert down on his serve throughout the final set, he sealed the match as the Frenchman's resistance finally fell and he double-faulted on match point.\n\nThis event marks Djokovic's first grand slam tournament since splitting with his longtime coach Goran Ivanisevic, and after travelling on the ATP tour with former doubles No 1 Nenad Zimonjic, he is joined in Paris by Boris Bosnjakovic, who previously worked as head coach in Djokovic's tennis centre in Belgrade.\n\nDjokovic's attempts to gain matchplay and rhythm in Geneva last week only added further question marks to his current level of play as he fell in the semi-finals to Tomas Machac. Before the tournament, Djokovic had described his approach to the tournament as having \"low expectations and high hopes\" but he also noted that he came here to win.\n\n\"I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are. Anything but a title for me is not satisfactory,\" he said. \"So it always has been like that. I know, it might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up.\"\n\nNow he is in the game, the goal, as usual, will be to build his form and work his way into the tournament in time to face tougher opponents in the rounds ahead. Djokovic will next face Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena of Spain, a natural clay-courter who will attempt to test Djokovic's patience in long, grinding rallies.\n\nAfter numerous questions of his motivation and energy in some of his matches this year, Djokovic said he was particularly pleased with how he conducted himself throughout the victory as his mind shifts towards round two: \"Again, this is only one match here,\" he said. \"So we have to see, see how I progress in the tournament, how the feeling evolves, but it was good. You know, I was fist pumping, I was focused, I was there, I was present. So I'm pleased with the way at least I behaved or had a mindset on the court. That was something that I was looking for. And where are you going to feel that way if not in grand slam?\n\n\"So it's something that I have been saying from the beginning of the year and from the last whatever years that Grand Slams are the ones that are basically getting me up from the bed every day and knowing that I have to hit the practice courts.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tumaini_carayol@theguardian.com", "name": "Tumaini Carayol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Hugues_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Hugues Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenad_Zimonji\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nenad Zimonji\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Mach\u00e1\u010d", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mach\u00e1\u010d"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/149469ddcce6d4e027147a54ced739b74eab461d/0_212_4454_2673/master/4454.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=19387274ad212e06c0dd99691be507e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605847", "eventUri": "eng-9605847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nOn Monday, as the sold-out crowd roared on Rafael Nadal in potentially his final battle on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Novak Djokovic was in an unusual position. For him, anyway. Usually, the world No 1 would be up the other end, walloping back another backhand or sprinting to a whipped Nadal forehand. But not this year and, by the end of 2024, Djokovic is likely to be the final member of the \"big four\" standing.\n\nThe Serb was in the stands during Nadal's loss to Alexander Zverev - alongside the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek - watching the end of an era with the 14-time champion's likely farewell from the French Open.\n\nBut tonight, the world No 1 was back in familiar territory: winning at a Grand Slam.\n\nHe didn't have it all his own way, particularly in a tight second-set, but the defending champion emerged victorious in a boisterous atmosphere under the lights against French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert, 6-4, 7-6(3), 6-4. And given his season so far, Djokovic will be satisfied with his level against a player who rose to the night-time stage.\n\nDjokovic has been out-of-form this year. Without a title, the Serb even took up a late entry to the warm-up tournament in Geneva last week and still couldn't claim some silverware as he lost in the semi-finals. The 37-year-old, in his pre-tournament press conference, therefore stated he had \"low expectations and high hopes\" as he targets a 25 Grand Slam over the Paris fortnight.\n\nReminder: that would be the most singles majors won by anyone, male or female.\n\n\"Anything but a title for me is not satisfactory, it always has been like that,\" Djokovic added. \"I know it might sound arrogant, but I have the career that backs it up.\n\n\"In the Grand Slams I normally play the best tennis, at least I aim always to play the best tennis, and I was able to do that for most of my career, so that's the goal.\"\n\nHis best tennis has most certainly deserted him since he won last year's end-of-season finals in Turin. After being stunned by Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, Djokovic has not even reached a final in four tournaments since, playing a streamlined schedule as he targets the big four events. It is an understandable approach. At 37, even Djokovic must temper the immense expectations of his body.\n\nAnd as he began his campaign on Tuesday night, the Serb looked in full-flow. Djokovic must at least reach the semi-finals to have any chance of preserving his number one ranking and he looked a man completely focused on the task.\n\nAfter claiming the first-set, he was up against an inspired opponent and the partisan home crowd in the second before - as he so often has - finding his best tennis for the tiebreak, scampering around the court as smooth as ever.\n\nBy the end, it was a trademark backhand pass down the line which effectively sealed it. It set up his first match point on Herbert's serve and, aware he couldn't just dolly the ball in play, the Frenchman double-faulted.\n\nSunday concluded with Andy Murray's final match at this tournament. Monday saw the same scenario for Nadal, in all likelihood. With Roger Federer now long gone, Djokovic continues to keep the spirit of tennis' big-four alive.

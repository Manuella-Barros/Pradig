Dressel followed up his triumph in the 50 freestyle with a winning time of 50.19 seconds, giving him a chance to defend another of the gold medals he captured at the 2021 Tokyo Games. Dressel didn\u2019t come close to his world record of 49.45, which he set while winning five times at the last Olympics. But he led all the way and touched about a half-body length ahead of 17-year-old Thomas Heilman, who earned the second spot for Paris in 50.80. Dressel will also swim up to three relays at the Summer Games, which would put him close to the six-event program he had in Tokyo. The only event he didn\u2019t win three years ago was the mixed relay. \u201cIt\u2019s tough making it through the trials,\u201d Dressel said. \u201cThis truly is the hardest part.\u201d The only individual gold that Dressel won\u2019t get to defend in Paris is the 100 freestyle. He missed out with a third-place showing in his first event of these trials.", "summary": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Caeleb Dressel locked up his second individual race in Paris with a victory in the men\u2019s 100-meter butterfly at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials Saturday night.

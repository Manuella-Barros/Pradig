The high court had on June 26 refused to interfere with the decision of the Chembur Trombay Education Society's N G Acharya and D K Marathe College imposing the ban, saying such rules do not violate students' fundamental rights.\n\nIt had said a dress code is meant to maintain discipline which is part of the college's fundamental right to \"establish and administer an educational institution\".\n\nTaking note of submission seeking urgent listing of the appeal, a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said it has already assigned a bench for the matter and that it would be listed soon.\n\nLawyer Abiha Zaidi, appearing for petitioners, including Zainab Abdul Qayyum, sought urgent hearing saying the unit tests in the college are likely to commence on Wednesday.\n\nThe top court is yet to conclusively decide the legality of such diktats issued by educational institutions.\n\nA two-judge bench of the top court, on October 13, 2022, had delivered opposing verdicts in the hijab controversy emanating from Karnataka. The then BJP-led state government had imposed a ban on wearing the Islamic head covering in schools there.\n\nWhile Justice Hemant Gupta, since retired, had dismissed the appeals challenging the judgement of the Karnataka High Court which had refused to lift the ban, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had held there shall be no restriction on the wearing of hijab anywhere in the schools and colleges of the state.\n\nThe present controversy stems from the decision of a Mumbai college.\n\nThe Bombay High Court trashed the plea against the ban and said the dress code was applicable to all students irrespective of religion or caste.\n\nThe students, who were in the second and third year of the science degree course, had moved the high court, challenging a directive issued by the college imposing a dress code under which students cannot wear a hijab, naqab, burka, stoles, caps and badges on the premises.\n\nThe students had claimed it was against their fundamental right to practice religion, the right to privacy and right to choice.\n\nThe college's action was \"arbitrary, unreasonable, bad-in-law and perverse\", the plea had said.\n\nThe high court, however, had said it could not see how the prescription of dress code by the college violated Articles 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 25 (freedom to practice religion) of the Constitution.\n\n\"In our view, the dress code as prescribed cannot be held to violate the petitioners' rights claimed under Article 19(1) (a) and Article 25 of the Constitution of India,\" the HC had said.\n\nThe high court had also refused to accept the petitioners' contention that wearing a hijab, naqab and burqa was an essential practice of their religion.\n\n\"Except for stating that the same constitutes an essential religious practice on the basis of the English translation of Kanz-ul-Iman and Suman Abu Dawud, there is no material placed to uphold the petitioners' contention that donning of hijab and naqab is an essential religious practice. The contention in that regard, therefore, fails,\" the HC had said.\n\nPrescribing a dress code should be seen as an \"exercise towards maintaining discipline\", and the right to do so flows from the fundamental right to establish and administer an educational institution under Article 19(1)(g) (right to practise any profession or run trade/business) and Article 26 of the Constitution, the HC had said.\n\nThe dress code was mandatory only within the college premises and the petitioners' freedom of choice and expression was not otherwise affected, it had said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Dhulia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Dhulia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Gupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112310349,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-751111,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 697, "textEnd": 704}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-10-", "textStart": 1636, "textEnd": 1646}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Burka, naqab, hijab or any part of the dress which reveals religion like badge, cap, stole is to be removed as soon as you come,\" the circular read.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Vidyagauri Lele, principal of Acharya-Marathe college, told mid-day that the dress code is important and beneficial for the students. \"As per the university circular, we teach 180 days out of 365, and students are required to attend at least 120-130 days. Given this, what problem should they have in following the dress code for these days? There are holidays and vacations when students can wear whatever they want.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chembur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junior college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/aug/SupremeCourt_d_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 317, "textEnd": 325}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1202, "textEnd": 1209}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

On October 13, 2022, a two-judge bench faced a split decision regarding a hijab ban in Karnataka schools. Justice Hemant Gupta, now retired, had upheld the ban, while Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had ruled that no such restrictions should be placed on wearing hijabs in schools and colleges.\n\nIn the current Mumbai case, the Bombay High Court had dismissed arguments that the dress code infringed upon fundamental rights. The petitioners, second and third-year science students, contended that the ban violated their rights to practice their religion, privacy, and choice.\n\nThe high court, however, rejected these claims, stating that the dress code did not contravene Articles 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 25 (freedom to practice religion) of the Constitution. It also found no evidence that wearing the hijab, naqabs, or burqas was an essential religious practice.

The then BJP-led state government had imposed a ban on wearing the Islamic head covering in schools there.\n\nWhile Justice Hemant Gupta, since retired, dismissed the appeals challenging the judgement of the Karnataka High Court refusing to lift the ban, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia held there shall be no restriction on the wearing of hijab anywhere in schools and colleges of the state.\n\nThe top court is yet to constitute a larger bench to decide the Karnataka hijab row.\n\nThe Mumbai college's decision has again put the spotlight on the issue.\n\nThe Bombay High Court had trashed the plea against the ban, saying the dress code was applicable to all students irrespective of religion or caste.\n\nThe students, who were in the second and third year of the science degree course, had moved the high court, challenging a directive issued by the college imposing a dress code under which students cannot wear hijabs, naqabs, burqas, stoles, caps and badges on the premises.\n\nThe students claimed it was against their fundamental right to practice religion, the right to privacy and right to choice. The college's action was \"arbitrary, unreasonable, bad-in-law and perverse\", the plea argued.\n\nThe high court, however, said it could not see how the prescription of dress code by the college violated Articles 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 25 (freedom to practice religion) of the Constitution.\n\nThe high court had also refused to accept the petitioners' contention that wearing a hijab, naqab and burqa was an essential practice of their religion.\n\n\"Except for stating that the same constitutes an essential religious practice on the basis of the English translation of Kanz-ul-Iman and Suman Abu Dawud, there is no material placed to uphold the petitioners' contention that donning of hijab and naqab is an essential religious practice. The contention in that regard, therefore, fails,\" the HC had said.\n\nThe dress code was mandatory only within the college premises and the petitioners' freedom of choice and expression was not otherwise affected, it had said.

However, the high court maintained that prescribing a dress code is within the institution's rights under Articles 19(1)(a), 25, and 26 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nThis controversy follows previous divided verdicts from the Supreme Court regarding a similar hijab ban in Karnataka, making this upcoming hearing crucial for establishing a conclusive legal stance on dress codes in educational institutions nationwide.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_08_2024_17_05_28_2475823.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

However, the court ruled that girls could not wear burqas inside the classroom and that no religious activities could be conducted on campus.\n\nJustices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar, who presided over the case, questioned the college's selective ban on religious symbols. They asked why the prohibition had not been extended to other markers of religion, such as tilak and bindi, if the intention was to enforce a uniform dress code. \"Girl students must have freedom of choice in what they are wearing, and the college cannot force them,\" the bench told the college administration. The judges expressed surprise that the college suddenly realized the existence of many religions in the country.\n\nJustice Kumar specifically asked, \"Can you say someone wearing a tilak will not be allowed? This is not part of your instructions?\"\n\nThe Supreme Court was hearing a plea challenging a Bombay High Court verdict from June that refused to interfere with the college's decision to implement the ban. Nine female students, enrolled in the second and third years of a science degree course, had challenged the college's directive on the grounds that it violated their fundamental rights, including the right to practice their religion, the right to privacy, and the right to choice.\n\nThe issue began on May 1, when the Chembur Trombay Education Society's NG Acharya & DK Marathe College issued a notice on its official WhatsApp group, including faculty members and students. The notice outlined a dress code banning the wearing of hijab, niqab, burqa, caps, badges, and stoles on the college premises. The petitioners argued that this directive was issued without any legal authority and was therefore \"bad-in-law, null and void.\"\n\nThe students initially approached the college management and the principal, requesting the withdrawal of the restrictions on hijab, niqab, and burqa, citing their right to choice, dignity, and privacy in the classroom. When their requests were ignored, they escalated the matter to the chancellor and vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, as well as the University Grants Commission, seeking intervention to ensure that education was imparted without discrimination. After receiving no response, the students filed a petition in the Bombay High Court.\n\nDuring the high court hearing, the petitioners' advocate, Altaf Khan, presented verses from the Quran to argue that wearing a hijab was an essential part of Islam. The plea stated that the college's action was \"arbitrary, unreasonable, bad-in-law, and perverse.\"\n\nThe college management defended the ban as a measure to enforce a uniform dress code and maintain discipline, denying any intent to discriminate against the Muslim community. Senior counsel Anil Anturkar, representing the college, asserted that the dress code applied to students of all religions and castes. The Supreme Court's stay on the college's circular means that, for now, students can choose to wear their religious attire on campus, except inside classrooms, until a final decision is reached.\n\nThe DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

The plea objects to the HC's view that the college's 'dress code' is aimed at discouraging discrimination. The petitioners have also faulted the court for accepting the college's assertion that it has a right to impose restrictions on students' dresses without citing any relevant law or rules.\n\nIn their plea before SC, the students argued that even though the college's dress code appears neutral, it primarily affects Muslim women.\n\nThe college caused controversy in May after it introduced a 'dress code' for all undergraduate students, requiring them to only wear 'formal' and 'decent' clothes, while specifically forbidding religious attire including hijab, naqab and burqa - the customary coverings worn by Muslim women. The instructions were challenged in the court by nine female students, who believed that the decision was discriminatory and infringed on their religious and personal freedoms.\n\nHowever, after a favourable order from the court on June 26, the college started evicting from classrooms not only those donning religious attire but also the other students who wore jeans and t-shirts, clothing deemed violative of its sartorial rules.

Is this not included in your guidelines?\" according to Live Law.\n\nThe Supreme Court was reviewing a petition that contested a Bombay High Court ruling from June, which declined to overturn the college's decision to enforce the ban.\n\nThe challenge was brought by nine female students in their second and third years of a science degree program, arguing that the college's directive infringed on their fundamental rights, including the right to practice their religion, the right to privacy, and the right to personal choice.\n\nThe controversy began on May 1 when the Chembur Trombay Education Society's NG Acharya & DK Marathe College issued a notice in its official WhatsApp group, which included both faculty members and students. The notice detailed a dress code that prohibited the wearing of hijab, niqab, burqa, caps, badges, and stoles on campus. The petitioners argued that this directive was issued without any legal authority, rendering it \"invalid, null, and void.\"\n\nThe students first approached the college management and the principal, requesting that the restrictions on hijab, niqab, and burqa be lifted, citing their rights to choice, dignity, and privacy in the classroom. When their requests were disregarded, they escalated the issue to the chancellor and vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, as well as the University Grants Commission, seeking intervention to ensure that education was provided without discrimination. After receiving no response, the students filed a petition with the Bombay High Court.\n\nDuring the high court hearing, the petitioners' advocate, Altaf Khan, referenced Quranic verses to argue that wearing a hijab is an essential part of Islam.

This is not part of your instructions?\" Justice Kumar asked, as per Live Law.\n\nRead: After hijab ban, Chembur college bars entry of students wearing jeans\n\nThe apex court was hearing a plea challenging a Bombay high court verdict from June, which refused to interfere with the college's decision to implement the ban.\n\nNine female students enrolled in the second and third years of a science degree course had challenged the college's directive on the grounds that it violated their fundamental rights, including the right to practice their religion, right to privacy, and right to choice.\n\nThe controversy began on May 1, when the Chembur Trombay Education Society's NG Acharya & DK Marathe College issued a notice on its official WhatsApp group, which included faculty members and students. The notice outlined a dress code that banned the wearing of hijab, niqab, burqa, caps, badges, and stoles on the college premises. The petitioners, in their plea, argued that this directive was issued without any legal authority and was therefore \"bad-in-law, null and void.\"\n\nThe students initially approached the college management and the principal, requesting the withdrawal of the restrictions on hijab, niqab, and burqa, citing their right to choice, dignity, and privacy in the classroom. When their requests were ignored, they escalated the matter to the chancellor and vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, as well as the University Grants Commission, seeking intervention to ensure that education was imparted without discrimination. However, after receiving no response, the students filed a petition in the Bombay high court.\n\nDuring the hearing in the high court, the petitioners' advocate, Altaf Khan, presented verses from the Quran to argue that wearing a hijab was an essential part of Islam.

The plea, filed by a group of students from NG Acharya & DK Marathe College, seeks to overturn the ban, which they argue infringes on their fundamental rights.\n\nThe matter has gained urgency as the petitioners, represented by advocate Abiha Zaidi, are facing immediate challenges. The term examinations at the college began on Thursday, and the students argue that the dress code prevents them from attending their exams. On Thursday morning, Zaidi mentioned the case before Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, stressing the need for an expedited hearing due to the ongoing examinations. The CJI informed Zaidi that the case had been assigned to a bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and PV Sanjay Kumar, which will hear the plea on Friday.\n\nThe controversy starts from a dress code implemented by NG Acharya & DK Marathe College in Mumbai, which prohibits students from wearing attire that signifies religious identity, such as hijab, niqab, burqa, stoles, and caps. Nine female students challenged this dress code in the Bombay High Court, arguing that it violates their constitutional rights. However, on June 26, a bench of Justices AS Chandurkar and Rajesh S Patil of the Bombay High Court rejected the students' plea. The court ruled that the enforcement of the dress code was confined to the college premises and did not interfere with the students' broader rights to freedom of choice and expression.\n\nFollowing the high court's decision, the students took their case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the college's dress code is arbitrary and discriminatory. They claim that the restrictions infringe on their rights under the Constitution, specifically their right to choose their attire, their right to privacy, and their freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a). Additionally, they assert that the dress code violates their right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Padma Vibhushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The students from the B.Sc and B.Sc (Computer Science) programs argued that the dress code implemented by the college is unconstitutional.\n\nIn response to the petitioner's advocate requesting an urgent hearing, the bench inquired, \"Are you being stopped from appearing in the exam?\" To this, the counsel responded, \"If students do not adhere to the uniform... please hear it today.\" However, the bench maintained that the matter would be addressed on Friday, saying, \"It is coming up tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Bombay High Court dismissed the plea in June, expressing its unwillingness to interfere with the college administration's decision. The college had justified the ban, stating that it applies to all religious symbols and is not specifically targeted at Muslims. The High Court supported the college's stance, suggesting that the dress code aims to enhance focus on education rather than religious identity.\n\nIn its order, the High Court stated, \"We are satisfied that the instructions issued by the College under which a dress code has been prescribed for its students do not suffer from any infirmity to violate provisions of Article 19(1)(a) and Article 25 of the Constitution of India.\"\n\nThe court further clarified, \"The objective behind issuing the same is that the dress of a student should not reveal his/her religion which is a step towards ensuring that the students focus on gaining knowledge and education which is in their larger interest.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's upcoming hearing will address the challenge to this decision and provide a final resolution on the matter.

The councel appearing for the students mentioned the case today before the top court and requested for an urgent hearing. The top court was told that the exams are starting in the college and thus the court should hear the matter today (Thursday) itself.\n\nCJI DY Chandrachud asked the counsel if the students are being stopped from appearing in exam.\n\nThe counsel informed that if the students do not adhereto the uniform prescribed by the college, they will not be allowed to in the exam.\n\nCJI Chandrachud however ensured the counsel for petitioners that the plea is listed for tomorrow and the court shall take it up.\n\nIn June, the Bombay High Court had junked a petition filed by nine female students challenging the dress code restrictions imposed by the authorities of a college in Mumbai. The college had prohibited students from wearing hijab, nakab, burkha, stole, etc., on campus.

The petitioners moved the high court calling these instructions illegal, arbitrary, and unreasonable. They further contended that the notice was not supported by any statutory authority.\n\nThe petitioner contended that they have been wearing the niqab and hijab for several years both within and outside the college.

The CJI informed the lawyer that the matter was already assigned to a bench that would hear it on Friday.\n\nThe case involves NG Acharya & DK Marathe College in Mumbai, which prescribed a dress code prohibiting students from wearing hijab, niqab, burqa, stoles, caps and similar items on campus. Nine female students challenged this dress code before the Bombay high court but to no avail.\n\nOn June 26, a Bombay high court bench of justices AS Chandurkar and Rajesh S Patil refused to entertain the students' plea, stating that the dress code's enforcement was limited to the college premises and did not otherwise affect the petitioners' freedom of choice and expression.\n\nHijab row: Why empowerment through education is the only right approach\n\nFollowing the high court's decision, the students appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the dress code and restrictions on wearing hijab, niqab, burqa and other religious attire on campus violate their fundamental rights.\n\nThe petitioners contended that the dress code, which mandates that students' attire be formal, decent, and not indicative of any religion, is arbitrary and discriminatory. They argued that the college's order infringes on their right to choose their attire, their right to privacy, and their freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a), as well as their right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.\n\nAt the core of the dispute is the clash between the state-mandated restriction on religious attire in educational institutions on the ground of maintaining public order and uniformity, and the constitutional rights of individuals to freely exercise their religious beliefs and free speech and expression - a larger issue still to be decisively determined by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn October 2022, the top court delivered a split verdict on the ban of wearing of the hijab in educational institutions in Karnataka - with one judge affirming that the state government is authorised to enforce a uniform in schools and the other calling the hijab a matter of choice that cannot be stifled by the state.\n\nJustice Hemant Gupta (since retired), in his judgment, dismissed all the appeals filed against the Karnataka high court judgment, which held in March that wearing of the hijab by Muslim women is not mandatory in Islam and that the Karnataka government was empowered to enforce the uniform mandate.\n\nHowever, justice Sudhanshu Dhulia at that time differed from the senior judge on the bench and allowed all the appeals. Reading out the operative part of his judgment, justice Dhulia said that wearing of the hijab is a matter of choice for a Muslim girl and there cannot be any restriction against it. Quashing the state government's prohibitory notification, justice Dhulia added that concerns regarding the education of a girl child weighed the most on his mind and the ban on the hijab would certainly come in the way of making her life better.\n\nIn view of the dissenting views, the matter was referred to the CJI for constituting an appropriate bench. The larger bench, however, has not been notified even as the matter remains pending.\n\nThe extensive hearing in the Karnataka case witnessed almost two dozen senior lawyers arguing over a spectrum of issues on behalf of girl students, Islamic bodies, rights groups, lawyers and activists. The petitioners, challenging the Karnataka high court order of affirming the ban, covered in their arguments the right to practice religion, freedom to dress as a matter of expression and identity, right to access education and alleged unreasonableness of the state's mandate. On the other hand, the Karnataka government countered the petitioners, maintaining throughout the proceedings that their circular to enforce the uniform was religion-neutral and aimed only at promoting uniformity and discipline in educational institutions of the state.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Padma Vibhushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

File picture\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to the plea for urgent listing of a petition filed by nine Muslim students challenging a Bombay High Court order that had upheld a Mumbai college's decision to ban hijab, burqa or other attire that reveals the religious identity of a person.\n\n\"I have already assigned a bench to hear the matter and it would be listed soon,\" Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a bench, told an advocate appearing for the students.\n\nThe counsel requested an early hearing of the matter during the morning mentioning time before the bench, which included Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra. The advocate pleaded that since the units of the students were to commence shortly, the SC should take up the matter for urgent listing.\n\nStudents Zainab Abdul Qayyum and others had filed the present appeal against a Bombay High Court judgment of June 26 by which it had upheld the decision of N.G. Acharya and D.K. Marathe to ban students from wearing hijabs, nakabs, burqas, stole, or caps that reveal the religious identity of the students.\n\nA two-judge division bench of the high court upheld the ban on the ground that the rules were enacted to enforce certain discipline among the students and the management was well within its right to enforce such rules under its fundamental right to establish and administer an educational institution.\n\nAggrieved, the students had filed the present appeal on the ground that the impugned rules infringe upon their fundamental right to choose their dress and their right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) besides their right to practice and profess one's religion under Article 25.\n\nOn October 13, 2022, a two-judge bench of the SC delivered a split verdict on the issue of whether wearing of hijab or other religious identity by students in educational institutions of Karnataka is part of a citizen's fundamental right as Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia took diametrically opposite views.\n\nJustice Gupta, heading the bench, had upheld the ban imposed by the Karnataka government, saying: \"Fraternity would be defeated if students are permitted to carry their apparent religious symbols with them to the classroom.\" Quashing the ban as \"unconstitutional\", Justice Dhulia had said: \"All the petitioners want is to wear a hijab.

Meanwhile, we stay clause 2 of the circular to the extent that it imposes a ban on hijab, burqa, caps, etc. We hope and trust this order won't be misused by anyone,\" stated the bench.\n\nA group of college students approached the Supreme Court against a Bombay high court judgment on June 26 that upheld the ban.\n\nSenior counsel Colin Gonsalves, representing the students, lamented that students have been stopped from attending classes even though they could wear hijab and similar attire in the last four years. \"What is this? Don't enforce such rules,\" the bench began, setting the tone for a sharp exchange with the college's lawyer, senior advocate Madhavi Divan.\n\nThe bench questioned the college's justification for the ban, which Divan claimed to be an attempt to prevent the revelation of students' religious identities. The bench responded pointedly: \"Your argument is that you don't want students' religion to be revealed. Will you want them to be given numbers at the gates so that their names are not revealed?\"\n\nWhile Divan argued that the institution aimed to empower women by preventing them from wearing religious attire, the bench underlined that empowerment should not come at the cost of personal freedom. \"Where's the question of empowering women by imposing what you want them to wear? Less said the better... Where is the choice for the women?\" the bench asked, stressing the importance of personal choice in matters of dress and religious expression.\n\nThe court also expressed its disappointment that students who opposed the ban felt compelled to leave the college. \"That's sad. That should not have happened. They must study together,\" remarked the bench, reflecting its concern over the divisive impact of the circular.\n\nThe bench also pulled up the college for the selective nature of the ban, which targeted specific religious attire while apparently allowing others, like tilaks and bindis, to go unaddressed. \"Did you say someone wearing a tilak won't be allowed? You haven't said no bindi. Your instructions are not talking about them,\" the bench told Divan, who contended that niqab and hijab were barriers to education.\n\nThe court criticised the college for suddenly realising, after years of operation, the religious diversity in the country. \"It's unfortunate you have come out with these kinds of instructions. After so many years of independence, you have come to realise there are different religions in this country. This college was set up in 2008. And now you realise there are different religions,\" it said.\n\nDivan, on her part, pointed out that as many as 441 Muslim girls are attending college without hijab or niqab and that only three girls had issues. She added that the college does not want to become either a ground to propagate political activities or religious activities because some other students might start wearing saffron shawls or something else.\n\nBut the bench highlighted the peril of issuing an instruction imposing a dress code. \"Why issue a circular of this nature? If three of them want to dress differently, let them do so. Maybe, they will realise later they don't need it...a lot of what you are arguing has a solution in education,\" it said.\n\nIssuing an interim order, the court stayed the implementation of the circular's clause that imposed the ban on religious attire, pending further hearings. Notably, the court's decision not only offers immediate relief to the students affected by the ban but also sets a precedent for the protection of individual rights against arbitrary institutional policies.\n\nThe Supreme Court's strong remarks and interim order reflect its commitment to upholding personal freedoms and preventing discriminatory practices in educational institutions. The case is set to continue, with broader implications for the balance between institutional autonomy and individual rights in India.\n\nOn June 26, a Bombay high court refused to entertain the students' plea against the college's circular, stating that the dress code's enforcement was limited to the college premises and did not otherwise affect the petitioners' freedom of choice and expression.\n\nFollowing the high court's decision, the students appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the dress code and restrictions on wearing hijab, niqab, burqa, and other religious attire on campus violate their fundamental rights. The petitioners contended that the dress code, which mandates that students' attire be formal, decent, and not indicative of any religion, is arbitrary and discriminatory. They maintained that the college's order infringes on their right to choose their attire, their right to privacy, and their freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a), as well as their right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.\n\nAt the core of the dispute is the clash between the restriction, state-mandated or otherwise, on religious attire in educational institutions on the ground of maintaining public order and uniformity, and the constitutional rights of individuals to freely exercise their religious beliefs and free speech and expression - a larger issue still to be decisively determined by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn October 2022, the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict on the ban on wearing of the hijab in educational institutions in Karnataka with one judge affirming that the state government is authorised to enforce a uniform in schools and the other calling the hijab a matter of choice that cannot be stifled by the state.\n\nJustice Hemant Gupta (since retired), in his judgment, had dismissed all the appeals filed against the Karnataka high court judgment, which held in March that wearing of the hijab by Muslim women is not mandatory in Islam and that the Karnataka government was empowered to enforce the uniform mandate.\n\nHowever, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had at that time differed from the senior judge on the bench and allowed all the appeals. Reading out the operative part of his judgment, Justice Dhulia said that wearing the hijab is a matter of choice for a Muslim girl and there cannot be any restriction against it. Quashing the state government's prohibitory notification, Justice Dhulia added that concerns regarding the education of a girl child weighed the most on his mind and the ban on the hijab would certainly come in the way of making her life better.\n\nIn view of the dissenting views, the matter was referred to the CJI for constituting an appropriate bench. The larger bench, however, remains to be notified.\n\nThe extensive hearing in the Karnataka case witnessed almost two dozen senior lawyers arguing over a spectrum of issues on behalf of female students, Islamic bodies, rights groups, lawyers, and activists. The petitioners, challenging the Karnataka high court order affirming the ban, covered in their arguments the right to practice religion, freedom to dress as a matter of expression and identity, right to access education, and alleged unreasonableness of the state's mandate.\n\nThe Karnataka government countered the petitioners, maintaining throughout the proceedings that their circular to enforce the uniform was religion-neutral and aimed only at promoting uniformity and discipline in educational institutions of the state.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A group of students from NG Acharya & DK Marathe College filed the plea, seeking to overturn the ban, arguing that it violates their fundamental rights.\n\nThe matter has become urgent as the petitioners, represented by advocate Abiha Zaidi, face immediate challenges. The college's term exams began on Thursday, and the students claim the dress code stops them from attending their exams.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Zaidi brought the case to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, emphasizing the need for a quick hearing due to the ongoing exams. The CJI told Zaidi that the case had been assigned to a bench with Justices Sanjiv Khanna and PV Sanjay Kumar, who will hear the plea on Friday.\n\nThe controversy began with a dress code enforced by NG Acharya & DK Marathe College in Mumbai, which bans students from wearing clothing that signifies religious identity, such as hijabs, niqabs, burqas, stoles, and caps. Nine female students challenged this dress code in the Bombay High Court, claiming it violates their constitutional rights.\n\nHowever, on June 26, a bench of Justices AS Chandurkar and Rajesh S Patil from the Bombay High Court dismissed the students' plea. The court ruled that the dress code's enforcement was limited to the college premises and did not infringe on the students' broader rights to freedom of choice and expression.\n\nAfter the high court's decision, the students appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the college's dress code is arbitrary and discriminatory. They claim that the restrictions violate their constitutional rights, including their right to choose their attire, their right to privacy, and their freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a). They also argue that the dress code infringes on their right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simran_rajpal@news24online.com", "name": "Simran Rajpal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The High Court had stated that the directive aimed to prevent the disclosure of a student's religion, thereby allowing them to focus solely on their education.\n\nA Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and PV Sanjay Kumar, while hearing the petition challenging the ban, expressed strong reservations about the college's rationale. \"How are you empowering women by telling them what to wear? Less said the better. Where is the choice for the woman? You have suddenly woken up to the fact that they are wearing it. It is unfortunate that these things are being said after so many years of independence, and you say religion is there in this country,\" Justice Kumar remarked, according to Bar & Bench.\n\nThe Court partially stayed the college's directive, specifically the clause that prohibited hijabs, caps, and badges on campus. The Bench issued notice on the petition and scheduled further hearings for the week commencing November 18. \"We hope and trust this interim order is not misused by anybody,\" the Court cautioned.\n\nThe petitioners, represented by Senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves, argued that the students had been wearing the hijab for four years without issue, and that the ban had led to them being barred from attending classes. Gonsalves emphasized that only a small number of Muslim students -- three out of 441 -- had expressed a desire to wear the hijab, underscoring that the college's ban was unnecessary and discriminatory.\n\nIn response, Senior Advocate Madhavi Divan, representing the college, defended the ban, stating that the niqab created a barrier to interaction and that the college sought to maintain uniformity among students. However, the Court was unconvinced, questioning why the decision was made abruptly and whether similar restrictions would apply to other religious symbols, such as tilaks or bindis.\n\nJustice Kumar further commented that such rule-making by educational institutions must stop, highlighting the importance of allowing students the freedom to choose their attire, especially when it does not disrupt the learning environment.\n\nThe Supreme Court's stay on the dress code directive offers temporary relief to the students, with the case set to continue in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "surinder_singh_oberoi@greaterkashmir.com", "name": "Surinder Singh Oberoi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interim order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Padma Vibhushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chembur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bindi_(decoration)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bindi (decoration)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Gonsalves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Gonsalves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www-greaterkashmir-com.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Supreme_Court_of_India_inside_bulidings_01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-18", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1371}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The petition, drafted by Adv Hamza Lakdawala and filed through Adv Abiha Zaidi, objects to the HC's view that the college's 'dress code' is aimed at discouraging discrimination. The petitioners have also faulted the court for accepting the college's assertion that it has a right to impose restrictions on students' dresses without citing any relevant law or rules.\n\nThe college caused controversy in May after it introduced a 'dress code' for all undergraduate students, requiring them to only wear 'formal' and 'decent' clothes, while specifically forbidding religious attire including hijab, naqab and burqa - the customary coverings worn by Muslim women. The instructions were challenged in the court by nine female students, who believed that the decision was discriminatory and infringed on their religious and personal freedoms.\n\nHowever, after a favourable order from the court on June 26, the college started evicting from classrooms not only those donning religious attire but also the other students who wore jeans and t-shirts, clothing deemed violative of its sartorial rules. This led to many of the students leaving the college for other institutes.\n\nIn their plea before SC, the students argued that even though the college's dress code appears neutral, it primarily affects Muslim women. The prohibition resulted in female Muslim students being stigmatised and not being able to attend classes, which also has resulted in victimisation and indirect discrimination under the guise of enforcing discipline, claim the petitioners.\n\n\"Many of the said students come from conservative families/societies where education for the female gender is actively discouraged. Such cultures only allow the female gender to study if they adhere to dressing conservatively, ie, in a hijab, nakab, burkha, etc. and following other tenets of their culture/faith. If the said liberty is not granted to such students, most of them will be forced to drop out of formal education and decades of progress achieved towards promotion of education for the female gender will be lost,\" reads the petition.\n\nThe petitioners also contend that banning hijab and burqa has no relation to maintaining discipline, the stated objective behind enforcing the dress code. \"The impugned instruction is manifestly arbitrary as the proposition of achieving \"formal and decent\" dressing amongst students by prohibiting the wearing of the hijab, niqab, burkha, etc. is so absurd and irrational that no reasonable person could justify the same. It is submitted that the object behind the Impugned Instruction is to achieve artificial uniformity at the cost of the student's right to personal liberty and decisional autonomy and the justification given, i.e., of achieving \"formal and decent\" dressing amongst students, is farce,\" reads the petition.\n\nThe plea argues that the HC also erred in relying on the Karnataka HC's judgment upholding the ban on hijab in education institutes of Karnataka.

Their names reveal their religion...will you ask them to be given numbers...,\" said the bench, also comprising Justice Sanjay Kumar, adding that a statutory issue is already pending before the court.\n\nThe apex court is yet to decide the legality of such directions issued by educational institutions. In October 2022, a two-judge bench of the apex court delivered opposing verdicts in the hijab controversy in Karnataka. The then BJP-led state government had imposed a ban on wearing the Islamic head covering in schools there.\n\nDuring the hearing, the top court was informed that there are 441 girls in the college from the Muslim community and barriers are created when a girl is wearing a niqab. Senior advocate Madhavi Divan, representing the college, said the college is already providing lockers and it is also providing changing rooms.\n\n\"They must study together...you may be right because the background they belong to, the family members may say wear and go and do not take it out...,\" said Justice Khanna.\n\nThe counsel said they emphasise on niqab and not just hijab, and they have not been wearing it always. The bench said should it not be left on the girl to decide what she wants to wear? Divan said tomorrow people will come in saffron shawls and the college does not want that to happen, and \"we are not a political playground or a religious playground\".\n\n\"Suddenly you woke up to the fact that there are different religions in the country?,\" asked the bench. The bench was informed that some women have joined other colleges, to which the bench replied, \"that it sad\".\n\n\"It is unfortunate you come up with these kinds of instructions after so many years of independence...,\" said the bench, staying the instructions issued by the college.\n\nDivan pressed that there should not be a stay and the court should hear her on the issue. \"With face cover, how do I allow....niqab, these are barriers to interaction,\" said Divan, adding that 441 Muslim girls are attending the college and there is no problem and it is these three girls in this controversy.\n\n\"But why issue a circular of this nature, let us assume three of them were wanting to be separate or distinct. Let them be. Probably within sometime they realize that it is not required...,\" said Justice Khanna.\n\nDivan said, \"if a girl wears a niqab or a prominent religious cover...\". At this juncture, the bench said, \"will you say that somebody wearing a tilak will not be allowed?....no bindi?\". Divan replied in the affirmative. The bench said they should not be asked to leave the college, Divan clarified that her client has not asked them to leave the college.\n\nThe bench issued notice on the petition returnable in the week commencing from November 18. In the order, the bench clarified that the stay order should not be misused by anybody and allowed the college authorities to seek the modification of the order if there is any such misuse. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves represented the petitioners. \"Certainly, no burqa can be permitted, cannot sit in class like that...\", said the bench, to which Divan questioned why a face cover should be permitted.\n\nThe plea filed by girl students' contended that the dress code was arbitrary and discriminatory and the college was wrong in its order in trying to impose a dress code. The plea said that the code infringes upon their right to choose their attire, their right to privacy, and freedom of expression under Article 19(1) (a) and their right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.\n\nThe authorities of the N G Acharya & D K Marathe College, in Mumbai prescribed a dress code prohibiting their students from wearing hijab, niqab, burkha, stole, cap, etc, on campus. The dress code was challenged by nine female students before the High Court. The Bombay High Court verdict had upheld a Mumbai college's decision to ban hijabs, burqas, and niqabs on the campus. The college students challenged the High Court's judgment before the top court.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bindi_(decoration)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bindi (decoration)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_of_proceedings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stay of proceedings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Gonsalves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Gonsalves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/09-08-2024/1200-675-22165606-855-22165606-1723198843909.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-18", "textStart": 3365, "textEnd": 3376}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The students in the petition also claimed that imposition of the dress code affects their right to education.\n\nIn Supreme Court, the same set of students have challenged the High court judgment saying that the College direction was without any authority of law, in so far that there is now law or rule which allows the college to frame such guidelines. The Supreme court on Tuesday had agreed to list the case for an early hearing.\n\nThe petitions also asserts that the direction on dress by college violated Article 14 of the Constitution as the act of prohibiting disclosure of religion, wearing a certain attire has no nexus with the object of promoting the 'formal and decent' dressing and maintaining discipline among students.\n\nThe petition has also argues that many of the students to the college come from conservative families/societies where education for the female gender is actively discouraged. Such cultures allow the female gender to study if they adhere to dressing conservatively, ie in a burkha, Nakab, hijab stc and following other tenets of their faith.\" And if the students are not granted the liberty to wear hijab, naka and burkha, most of them will be forced to drop out of formal education and decades of progress achieved towards promotion of education for female gender will be lost.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashok_bagriya@news9live.com", "name": "Ashok Bagriya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chembur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Supreme-court-PTI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Acharya and D.K. Marathe College in Mumbai. The college, managed by the Chembur Trombay Education Society, had enforced a ban on wearing hijabs, burqas, caps, and naqab on campus, a policy that has sparked significant legal and social debate.\n\nThe Supreme Court's intervention came after the PTI reported on the court's observations and the subsequent legal proceedings. A bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar criticized the college's decision, stating that educational institutions should not impose restrictions on students' personal choices related to their religious attire. The court remarked on the sudden realization by the college of India's religious diversity, implying that such a ban was both insensitive and unjustified.\n\nThe court issued a notice to the Chembur Trombay Education Society, requesting a detailed response by November 18. The bench highlighted that while students' rights to wear hijabs or burqas should be respected, the wearing of burqas inside classrooms was not permissible. The court clarified that no religious activities could be conducted on the campus, reflecting a nuanced stance on the intersection of personal freedom and institutional policies.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the court questioned the rationale behind the dress code. It noted that if the intent was to prevent the display of religious identities, similar restrictions should apply to other religious symbols, such as 'tilak' and 'bindi'. This line of questioning pointed to the arbitrary nature of the ban and suggested that the policy was selectively enforced.\n\nSenior advocates Colin Gonsalves and Abiha Zaidi, representing the petitioners including Zainab Abdul Qayyum, argued that the ban had serious implications for students, particularly with term exams approaching. They contended that the dress code impeded the students' ability to attend classes and participate fully in their education. The urgency of their plea was underscored by the imminent examination period, which added a layer of pressure to the legal challenge.\n\nEarlier, the Bombay High Court had upheld the college's dress code decision on June 26, ruling that such rules did not infringe upon the students' fundamental rights. However, the Supreme Court's recent intervention represents a critical reassessment of the High Court's decision, reflecting broader concerns about religious freedom and institutional authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court's interim order highlights the ongoing debate about the balance between institutional regulations and individual rights. It underscores the importance of protecting personal freedoms while maintaining institutional standards. The court's decision to partially stay the ban and seek further clarification from the college signals a commitment to ensuring that educational policies do not disproportionately affect students' rights.\n\nAs the case continues, the Supreme Court's stance will likely shape future discussions on similar issues across educational institutions in India. The outcome will be closely watched by both legal experts and the public, as it addresses key questions about the limits of institutional authority and the protection of religious freedoms within academic settings.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pallavi_raja_shekhar@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Pallavi Raja Shekhar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chembur", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chembur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trombay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilaka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tilaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bindi_(decoration)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bindi (decoration)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Gonsalves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colin Gonsalves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interim order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/08/09/1829829-gk9efuybuaaxcoq.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793909", "eventUri": "eng-9793909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-18", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 970}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 2237, "textEnd": 2244}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

In a stinging observation, the court also remarked that it was unfortunate that such bans were imposed even so many years after Independence.\n\nHearing a petition filed by nine girl students against the ban on burqas, hijab, niqab, caps, stoles and badges imposed by the NG Acharya & DK Marathe College in Mumbai's Chembur on Friday, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and PV Sanjay Kumar partially stayed the order. It said hijabs, caps and badges would be allowed and added that it hoped that the order would not be misused.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Senior Advocate Madhavi Divan, appearing on behalf of the college, said that if the petitioners were allowed to wear hijabs and burqas, other students would come wearing saffron shawls to make a political point and it did not want that to happen.\n\n\"Will you ban girls wearing a bindi or tilak?\" the bench asked.\n\nThe lawyer for the college said that there were 441 students from the community in the college and when a girl wears a veil or an article of clothing like that, it creates a barrier between her and the other students. She also pointed out that changing rooms had been arranged for the students to take off their hijabs or burqas before entering.\n\n\"You may be right (but) the background they come from, family members may say wear it and go and they have to wear it. But everyone should study together,\" the court said.\n\n'Suddenly Woken Up'\n\n\"How are you empowering women by telling them what to wear? What girls want to wear should be left to them. Where is their choice? You have suddenly woken up that they are wearing it? It is unfortunate that after so many years of independence, such a ban is being talked about,\" Justice Kumar said.\n\nWhen the college argued that the ban was also in place to ensure that the students' religion was not disclosed, the court remarked that religion is revealed by names as well and stressed that such rules must not be imposed.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nNoting that wearing a burqa could not be allowed as students could not sit in class like that, the court partially stayed the circular and said, \"We issue notice in the week commencing November 18.

Justice Khanna questioned the rationale behind the rule, stating, \"What is this? Don't impose such a rule..\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of India issued an interim order to pause the hijab ban imposed by NG Acharya & DK Marathe College in Mumbai. The ruling came during a hearing of a petition filed by the college's students challenging the ban on wearing hijabs, caps, and badges on campus.\n\nA bench, consisting of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar, expressed surprise at the college's restriction.\n\nJustice Khanna questioned the rationale behind the rule, stating, \"What is this? Don't impose such a rule... what is this? Don't reveal religion?\" His remarks highlighted concerns over the college's intention to prevent the disclosure of students' religious affiliations through their attire.\n\nHe further probed the college's rationale, asking, \"Will their names not reveal religion? Will you ask them to be identified by numbers?\" He emphasised the importance of allowing students to study together without such divisive regulations.\n\nSenior Advocate Madhavi Divan, representing the college, argued that as a private institution, the college had the autonomy to enforce its dress code.\n\nHowever, Justice Kumar challenged this by pointing out that the college had operated since 2008 without such restrictions, questioning the timing and necessity of the new rules.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed that face-covering veils, such as nakabs or burkhas, could be a barrier to classroom interaction and upheld the prohibition on such attire, but it stayed the broader ban on hijabs, caps, and badges.\n\nThe controversy began when the Bombay High Court, on June 26, dismissed petitions from nine female students challenging the dress code. The High Court had upheld the college's policy, stating it aimed to prevent the disclosure of students' religious identities and maintain uniformity.\n\nThe High Court's decision referred to the Karnataka High Court's judgment in Resham v.

The Court has issued a notice to the college administration, seeking their response to the matter.\n\nThe controversy initially began when nine female students challenged the ban in the Bombay High Court, only to have their plea dismissed.

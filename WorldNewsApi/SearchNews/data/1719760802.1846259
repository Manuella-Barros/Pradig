She spoke Wednesday at Embakasi Garrison in Nairobi County where she joined defence cabinet colleague Aden Duale and the Kenya Defence Forces rank and file led by Deputy Army Commander Maj Gen Mohamed Hassan and General Officer Commanding (GOC) Eastern Command Maj Gen Luka Kutto. Tuya said Kenya\u2019s security apparatus including the military and the police had acknowledged climate change as an escalator of insecurity especially among communities occupying vulnerable ecosystems and degraded landscapes. \u201cAs you have seen with our colleague CS Kindiki of Interior, climate change is topping insecurity problems in our country. So, it is an existential problem which commands us to have and to strengthen the whole-of-Government approach,\u201d she said. With an annual target of propagating 80 million seedlings and planting 50 million trees, CS Tuya said the military was her ministry\u2019s greatest ally in the Kenya Kwanza administration\u2019s flagship climate action programme that seeks to raise Kenya\u2019s tree cover to 30pc in ten years by growing 15 billion trees. CS Tuya explained that the new approach where each cabinet secretary has been assigned specific degraded ecosystems for full restoration was meant to shift the country from the traditional tree planting to nurturing trees to maturity. \u201cWe have targets for each and every ministry, department and agency of government. We have shifted from simply planting trees to growing them to maturity.\u201d She said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, as a cabinet directive, we have a cabinet secretary, with all their departments and agencies, out there in the field making sure that we\u2019re keeping up with our targets,\u201d Tuya added. On his part, CS Duale acknowledged that climate change was an insecurity multiplier and assured that his ministry was determined to achieve its seedling propagation and tree growing targets ahead of schedule. He said KDF had established a dedicated ecosystem restoration unit charged with driving forward the tree growing initiative that had, among other achievements, overseen the growing of 12 million since the launch of the initiative in December 2022. Maj Gen Luka Kutto, KDF\u2019s GOC Eastern Command also spoke at the event, assuring that his soldiers were determined to overshoot set seedling propagation and tree growing targets.", "summary": "<p>Environment, Climate Change and Forestry Cabinet Secretary Soipan Tuya has said tree growing is an effective antidote to the worsening climate crisis which she termed as the greatest existential threat currently facing humanity. &#8220;Trees are our greatest allies in the fight against the climate crisis which is the greatest existential threat of our time,&#8221; the [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.kbc.co.ke/trees-best-weaponry-in-climate-change-fight-cs-tuya-says/\">Trees best weaponry in climate change fight, CS Tuya says</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.kbc.co.ke\">KBC</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/trees-best-weaponry-in-climate-change-fight-cs-tuya-says/", "image": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240529-WA0028-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:01:18", "author": "Christine Muchira,Deputy Army Commander", "authors": ["Christine Muchira", "Deputy Army Commander"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ke", "sentiment": 0.433}

Since the Ineos chief has bought into the club he's quickly established that changes are needed and he's wasted no time pursuing the men he wants - and axing those he doesn't. Manchester United haven't mounted a title challenge in over a decade. The odd domestic trophy has provided days of celebration, but on the whole they're at a lowly ebb, backed up by their worst ever Premier League finish. As a result Ratcliffe has made changes in the positions he could address immediately and with minimal outlay. They are in the board room with the Brit already seeking out the likes of Omar Berrada, captured from Manchester City, Jason Wilcox and, they hope, Dan Ashworth. The Newcastle chief, who has performed impressive work at St James' Park and at Brighton, is going to arbitration to force through a move to Old Trafford. The Magpies have dug their heels in and demanded a huge fee, which United are unwilling to pay. Senior staff given the boot In order to hire them though other individuals have paid the price. Richard Arnold, who worked for years under Ed Woodward before being promoted, didn't last long. Before Ratcliffe's deal was even confirmed Arnold's exit was announced after he'd spent 16 years in Manchester. The chief executive waved goodbye with a \u00a35.5m pay off with Berrada soon taking his role. He provided \"transitional support\" until the end of December. Back in April John Murtough's departure as football director came to an end, just a matter of years after a reshuffle that saw him assume the role after more than a decade at the club. Patrick Stewart, who stepped in to assume Arnold's role on an interim basis, left at the end of the season. Chief financial officer, Cliff Baty, also departed as the wholesale changes continue. Baty will be replaced by former Ineos Sport chief financial officer Roger Bell as Ratcliffe continues to bring his own people on board. Sir Dave Brailsford, the genius who led British Cycling's ascent to Olympic glory and Team Sky's Tour de France dominance, is one of Ratcliffe's most trusted allies and his 'marginal gains' ethos has become renowned. He's often been seen in the stands and is set to provide expertise. Ratcliffe sat in the stands, as did Brailsford, during the FA Cup final victory over City, which ensured United will feature in Europe next season. The 71-year-old's smiling face covers up a ruthless business brain though with his cost cutting measures beginning to take place. Brutal email communication He's sent several club-wide emails regarding the need to improve standards and cut costs, seemingly with little concern around how it'll go down with the staff. After a two-day tour of the club's facilities, which are regarded as second rate after years of neglect, he made his feelings clear. Ratcliffe said: Ratcliffe wrote: \u201cI had a good tour around the some of the facilities. I am afraid I was struck in many places by a high degree of untidiness. In particular the IT department which frankly was a disgrace and the dressing rooms of the U18 and U21 were not much better. \u201cThese standards would not come close to what we would expect at INEOS and we are a chemical company. Manchester United is an elite sporting organisation. It\u2019s a small thing in many ways but unless an organisation has standards and discipline it will not succeed. I would be grateful in future if we adopt the proper standards of housekeeping everywhere.\" Shortly after, despite a club tradition that paid for club staff to head down Wembley for finals with plus ones, Ratcliffe made it known that would no longer be happening. He said: \u201cWhile we appreciate this is a change from previous trips, you will all be aware of the need for us to spend the club\u2019s money effectively, with a focus on performance and outcomes.\" Now Ratcliffe's latest move has encouraged a host of the staff to leave the club, especially if they don't want to work from the office, offering them early paid up bonuses if they opt to walk away from the Manchester outfit. The Ineos chief wants to get all employees into the club\u2019s facilities as he pushes to trim the workforce. The email said of the office\u2011only policy: \u201cWhilst many have -welcomed our new approach, we are aware that a number of colleagues prefer not to commit to this new way of working and are keen to understand their options. With this feedback in mind and the fact that we respect each colleague\u2019s right to choose their approach to work, we will allow those who wish to resign now to claim their bonus early for this season if they cannot work from our offices from 1 June.\u201d Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

{"id": 239769524, "title": "I'm braving the NYC heat without AC \u2014 I don't get why everyone is so panicked about normal summer temperatures", "text": "Oh say can you AC? One heat happy New Yorker chose one of Summer 2024\u2019s sweatiest days to fan up a heated debate over the merits and necessity of apartment air conditioning. The fresh air freak wound up triggering a BTU brouhaha by announcing their dislike of the seasonal window-killer on Reddit\u2019s popular Ask NYC message board. \u201cI\u2019ve not yet installed my AC unit. I live on the 8th floor close enough to the water that there\u2019s a steady cross breeze,\u201d the sweaty Redditor sniffed. \u201cThe past two days have been fine as long as the fans are going.\u201d \u201cI hate the lack of sunlight and fresh air that comes with installing AC, as I only have one window in each room. And the noise is maddening,\u201d they explained. Their question to the active and opinionated group on the lively subreddit: \u201cIs this a health risk? Isn\u2019t summer supposed to be hot?\u201d To the tropical temp touter, 90 degrees seemed \u201cnormal for summer.\u201d Cold-loving commenters fled for their fainting couches at the very notion of surviving June, July and August in the Apple without the essential appliance. \u201cI hug my AC every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. Sometimes I bring it flowers,\u201d said one, echoing the sentiments of many. \u201cI just chill with mine,\u201d another joke. Others took a more serious tone in their responses. \u201cBe mindful that we\u2019re in some really uncomfortable and potentially dangerous levels of heat. Heat indexes are approaching 105-110 degrees which is the measure of how warm the heat feels to our body. Pay close attention to how your body feels to monitor for any health concerns,\u201d one concerned citizen shared. Another responder warned about air pollution, noting that keeping the windows open all summer is \u201cprobably not a great idea if you have any pre-existing health conditions like heart issues, asthma, etc,\u201d going on to point out that \u201cair quality also goes down when heat rises, and it\u2019s not necessarily the healthiest to just expose yourself to it all.\u201d Most air conditioners, they said, will filter out the worst of the gunk. \u201cAs an adult with mild-moderate asthma (who also made the terrible decision to open their windows during those really smokey nights a few years ago because I rly like the smell of bonfire)\u2026 protect your lungs y\u2019all. It\u2019s possible to do some real damage in a pretty short amount of time under the wrong conditions,\u201d one sage advisor shared.

Others called the OP \u201cinsane,\u201d hoped that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have any pets,\u201d and warned them never to invite guests over without informing them that they didn\u2019t have air conditioning. With hot summer afternoons in abundance in New York, NYC.gov reports that 90% of households in the five boroughs have air conditioning. That number can drop significantly, depending on the neighborhood, to as low as 76% in low-income areas like the South Bronx, the city said. An NYC.gov survey that sampled a range of New Yorkers showed that 15% of households that do have air conditioning opt not to use it at all.", "summary": "A heated debate over the merits and necessity of apartment air conditioning.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/lifestyle/im-braving-the-nyc-heat-without-ac-am-i-crazy/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/happy-young-woman-feeling-better-84302284.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:49:44", "author": "David Landsel", "authors": ["David Landsel"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.283}

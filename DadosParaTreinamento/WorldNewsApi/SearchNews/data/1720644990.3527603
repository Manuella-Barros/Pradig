Reasons are the strength of the labour market, the shortage of housing supply, the sharp rise in rental prices and the process of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), which will expected to start this month. Bankinter estimates a shortage of more than 50,000 properties per year, compared to an annual demand of 150,000 homes. The deficit is concentrated in the main cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao, as well as the Mediterranean coast, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. Added to this is the rise in rental costs due to a lack of rental housing which has fallen by 15% in the last 12 months. According to figures from property portal idealista, this is a result of legal uncertainty, the Housing Law and the increase in other alternatives such as seasonal or tourist rentals. House prices could be further strained by interest rate cuts which will cut the 12-month Euribor rate.Bankinter estimates that the 12-month Euribor will end in 2024 at 3.25%, falling again in 2025 to 2.75%, which will translate into a moderate fall in interest rates on mortgages. Regarding housing transactions, the bank forecasts a drop of 5% in 2024, compared to the previous estimate of 7%.", "summary": "<img width=\"490\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-490x325.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Property prices in Spain will increase more than previously expected this year, says Bankinter in latest report\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-490x325.jpg 490w, https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-", "url": "https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2024/06/08/property-prices-in-spain-will-increase-more-than-previously-expected-this-year-says-bankinter-in-latest-report/", "image": "https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Property-sales-bounce-back-in-Spain-after-last-years-pandemic-restrictions-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:49:56", "author": "Alex Trelinski", "authors": ["Alex Trelinski"], "language": "en", "source_country": "es", "sentiment": -0.273}

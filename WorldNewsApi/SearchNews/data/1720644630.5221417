Email: milo.pope.mol@mailonline.co.uk By Milo Pope Published:13:29 BST, 8 June 2024 |Updated:13:41 BST, 8 June 2024 e-mail View comments This is the magical moment a couple get engaged during Taylor Swift's sellout Eras Tour concert in Edinburgh. The 34-year-old megastar drove 72,990 Swifties wild on Friday night as she emerged at Murrayfield Stadium to perform a three-hours plus epic in the first of 15 UK shows that will stretch out across the summer. Over the course of 46 songs, she shook off a cramp in her hand, gifted a fan her hat and even suspended a tune so fans could receive medical aid. But perhaps the most special moment of the night came when the pop icon witnessed a live proposal in the audience. Footage posted online shows the two women hugging and kissing each other with beaming smiles after the proposal while Swift performs her song 'Cardigan'. ? @taylorswift13 congratulates this gorgeous couple on their engagement! pic.twitter.com/bcHs3htBOD\u2014 The Eras Tour UK & Ireland (@TheErasTourUK) June 8, 2024 This is the moment a couple get engaged while Taylor Swift performs her song 'Cardigan' The 34-year-old singer said the proposal was 'amazing' and she was so happy that she got to see 'the whole thing' After finishing the song, Swift says to the audience: 'I love performing this entire show in the sunlight, because I'm pretty sure I just, like, saw somebody getting engaged over here,' as the crowd cheered. She then asked the couple, 'Did it happen?' and then said, 'Yes!' as she balled her fists in the air in excitement after it was apparently confirmed that the proposal had indeed taken place. 'You have no idea, I never get to see that, right? Because it's, like, dark usually at night,' she explained to the crowd.

Uh, man, that's amazing. Thanks for doing that at my concert, that's a big moment \u2014 huge!' Commenting below the video online, one person wrote: 'I love how they didnt clock for a while because they were taking their moment in.' Another said: 'Awww that\u2019s beautiful,' while a third wrote: 'Would literally DIE.' A fourth added: 'I was hoping to find this!! So freaking beautiful!' A fifth also commented: 'Amazing, and also proposing during cardigan is peak good taste.' Fans queued for hours - some as early as 3am - in order to be the first inside for the gig yesterday, which kicked off following Paramore's set at exactly 7.18pm. Excitement built to fever pitch with a two-minute countdown on the big screen before Taylor finally emerged from a stage, which rose dramatically into the air in the middle of the stadium to hysterical screams from fans. Taylor started out with 2019 tune Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince. And as she took in the adoration of thousands of fans she had in the palm of her hand, she almost seemed overwhelmed by the response. Taylor Swift well and truly gave fans a spectacle as she underwent twelve outfit changes during her sell-out Edinburgh show on Friday night The skintight garment featured blue and gold sequins while the superstar added height to her frame with shimmering knee-high boots To date she has released 10 studio albums since 2006, and four re-recordings, which is part of her mission to completely own her own music It's a nod to the music video which sees her sport the hat for most of the clip, as well as the memorable black and white shirt with the text: 'Not a lot going on at the moment' Another outfit change for Cardigan saw Taylor wear a flowing green ensemble She looked incredible in a blue sleeveless dress with a low cut neckline and flowing train The original recordings of her first six albums were owned by a record label, which is often the case for most musical artists Taylor has two albums left to re-record: her debut self-titled album and Reputation Between songs, she paused to tell them: 'What a way to welcome a lass to Scotland... you've gone and made me feel so amazing\u2026 You've got me feeling really, really powerful.' Towards the end, she vowed: 'We have to do this again.' The sell-out show saw her run through a cavalcade of hits including Cruel Summer, Lover, You Belong With Me, Love Story and 22 - which saw her hand a fedora hat to a young fan in the audience, as is tradition at each show - within the first hour alone, before moving onto later 'eras' in her illustrious career. Read More Taylor Swift's Edinburgh show: Critics are united in praise for star's Eras Tour Ms Swift also said she had made history, with last night's Murrayfield gig having the highest attendance of any stadium show the country has ever seen. She told the crowd: 'I have not been in Scotland for almost a decade now. And I was wondering what it was going to be like when we go back to visit there, how are they going to be as a crowd and, do you know what, you kind of answered me before I even got on stage. 'I had someone pull me aside and say, \"Hey, we've checked this 20 times and we swear... tonight's concert is the most highly attended stadium show in Scottish history\".' And in a nod to her Scottish audience, she gave backing dancer Kameron Saunders the opportunity to say 'Nae chance!' as she performed We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.

They say Gomez hit a fence causing his vehicle to roll over which led to a 6-year-old girl being ejected.\n\nA neighbor who didn't want to go on camera says he woke up to a medical helicopter flying over his house to rush the girl to the hospital.

A judge set his bond at over $150,000.\n\nImmigration officials have placed a hold on Gomez.

The Argentine was not training regularly and any time with a racquet in hand was spent in a continental grip, feeding and coaching for 11 hours a day.\n\nA 2019 graduate of the University of Louisville, Gomez was figuring out his post-college life in south Florida. A summer internship required Gomez in the office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and robbed him of any time to polish his game. Recognising he was not able to fully commit to training, Gomez decided to pursue coaching. Then the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 was just another roadblock in his hopes of playing beyond the collegiate level.\n\n\"I was like, 'Okay, what am I doing? The Tour is not going anywhere, everything is stopped, so I'm just going to stop here and start teaching,'\" Gomez told ATPTour.com.\n\nTrying to make ends meet in his new role, Gomez was missing the thrill of competition. Then, in September 2021, Gomez's friend, Pedro Caniza, approached him and offered financial help to kickstart his career.\n\n\"I was doing okay, like I was working, I was happy. I had a place to stay. I had a car. Everything was good. But that something else was missing,\" Gomez said.\n\n\"[Pedro] saw me playing matches and he was the one like, 'Hey, what are you doing? You can teach after! There's no need for you to be teaching right now. Why don't you give yourself another chance.' He was a big part of the reason why I am here today.\"\n\nIt is easy to see why Gomez said, 'I didn't expect to win,' after triumphing at last month's ATP Challenger Tour event in Milan. Seven days after his first-round qualifying match on the Italian clay, Gomez had his hands around the trophy. He raised his arms in the air and cracked a smile so wide it felt palpable through a computer screen. It has been a difficult, but rewarding path for Gomez to reach this point.\n\n\"I was just teaching and trying to make a living out of [coaching],\" Gomez said. \"I was trying to stay healthy just doing fitness. But tennis, no, not at all. I don't think I hit a two-handed backhand in two years. I was just doing fitness in the morning or late afternoon. I didn't really have the time and also I was kind of disconnected from the entire Tour mentality.\"\n\nGomez's journey to a career-high No. 224 in the PIF ATP Rankings is maybe different than what he would have imagined at age 17, when he earned his first ATP point.\n\n\"I thought I had it all. I thought I was on top of the world, that I could do whatever I wanted,\" Gomez said. \"But nothing else changed. I decided to go to Europe to try and make out a living. Things didn't go as planned. There were some issues in Europe with visas and stuff, I wasn't getting the opportunity to stay there.\"\n\nUpon returning to Argentina, Gomez told his parents, Marcelo and Patricia, that he was going to attend college in the United States. The Buenos Aires native narrowly beat application deadlines, arriving at ASA College Miami and three days later competing in a dual meet. After a year and a half at the junior college level, Gomez transferred to the University of Louisville, where he studied sport administration.\n\nThe 27-year-old is the oldest first-time winner on the ATP Challenger Tour this season. The week of his title run was also his first week working with his new coach Cesar Chiappari, who was in tears after Gomez secured the title. 'Fede' later shared a memorable phone call with his parents.\n\n\"It was funny because they couldn't watch the first match because it was super early for them. I was first on for qualies that Sunday and they didn't watch it. I won, so my mom tried to keep things the same way,\" Gomez said. \"They didn't watch any more matches. They just followed the scores and stuff.\n\n\"When I called and they were driving, we had a little conversation. They were screaming and so happy for me. I really enjoyed seeing their faces. All of the hard work they've put in over the years to help me reach my goals... It's a big step moving forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Louisville", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Louisville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASA College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junior college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Bus", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Bus", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Unemployment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/07/10/03/23/gomez-milanch-2024-emotion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722655", "eventUri": "eng-9722655", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

(WALA) - A Honduran immigrant now faces a charge of manslaughter after police said he crashed his car while driving drunk early Monday morning, July 8, 2024. A six-year-old child who was a passenger has since died from her injuries.\n\nZevlin Pavon-Gomez appeared in court using an interpreter for his bond hearing Wednesday. For the second time this week, 25-year-old Zelvin Pavon-Gomez appeared before District Judge Bill Scully. Wednesday's appearance was to set bond on an upgraded charge, from assault 1st to manslaughter. Baldwin County prosecutors said a violent crash on County Road 28 near George Younce Road Monday just after 3:00 a.m. was the result of Gomez driving drunk behind the wheel. A six-year-old girl was thrown from the vehicle and later died.\n\n\"He lost control of the vehicle, struck a fence and there was a roll-over event. Prior to that roll-over event, the child was ejected, and the vehicle landed on the child,\" explained Chef Assistant District Attorney, Teresa Heinz.\n\nInvestigators said the six-year-old was not wearing a child restraint. She was flown to the hospital and Gomez was initially charged with assault 1st. The child died Tuesday, elevating the charge to manslaughter. Heinz told the Court Gomez admitted to having been drinking and buzzed at the time of the accident.\n\n\"He admitted to being at a party where alcohol was consumed. He admitted to being quote-unquote, \"buzzed\" and blacking out, not remembering the actual events of the actual crash itself,\" Heinz said.\n\nProsecutors said the victim was not Zevlin Gomez's child but described her as looking to Gomez as a father figure. It's unknown where they were heading at the time of the crash. Heinze said it's been difficult to look into Gomez's criminal history to this point but said he did apply for asylum from Honduras in 2019 but was denied.\n\nThe state requested, and Judge Bill Scully agreed to a $200,000 bond. If he makes that bond, amongst other things, he'll be required to wear a GPS ankle monitor and an alcohol monitor.", "source": {"uri": "fox10tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX10 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Heinz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Heinz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerdale,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summerdale, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summerdale, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic tagging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://gray-wala-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/IPPMV2JVYVCH5BKICQRK65LA3U.jpg?auth=b25e121e95c1d9c0bcbed773a6050e7affb0ae1205d4cab0fba7db71af8740af&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722655", "eventUri": "eng-9722655", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

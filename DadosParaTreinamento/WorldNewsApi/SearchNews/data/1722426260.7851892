{"id": 243351910, "title": "Irish renters living in fear: \u2018I\u2019m working in a Government job, and I feel so abandoned\u2019", "text": "Many of Ireland\u2019s renters are living in fear that one change in circumstance could leave them homeless overnight. The main reason people contact homelessness-prevention organisation Threshold is that they have received an eviction notice from their landlord, according to chief executive John-Mark McCafferty. Their problem? They have nowhere else to go. There are around 330,000 properties being rented in the private sector, according to the latest figures. No tenant is immune from losing the roof over their head if their landlord wants to sell or have a family member move in. \u201cIn Ireland we have a thing called \u2018no-fault evictions\u2019, which means you can be evicted through no fault of your own,\u201d says Lorcan Sirr, lecturer on housing at TU Dublin. \u201cIn every country you can be evicted if you don\u2019t pay the rent, or if you trash the place...but there\u2019s very few countries where you can be evicted just because your landlord\u2019s mother-in-law wants to stay in the property two weekends a month,\u201d he says. That is not to mention common life upheavals deeming a property unsuitable or the rent price too high \u2013 such as a relationship break-up, a housemate deciding to move out, or the arrival of a new baby. In such situations it is not easy to simply find another place, with lack of supply forcing renters to compromise on location and convenience \u2013 that\u2019s if they can in fact find another place that might fit their needs in the first place. And, with rent having risen 9 per cent just in 2023, according to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), many find they are being priced out of the rental sector altogether. The RTB\u2019s price index of new tenancies for the final quarter of 2023 put the national standardised average rent at \u20ac1,415, with average rents ranging from \u20ac1,972 a month in Dublin to \u20ac740 in Leitrim. [ Threshold survey finds three-quarters of tenants struggle to pay bills after covering rent ] [ Ireland is spending big on housing. So why is the sector still in crisis? ] Some who run out of options can turn to parents for help, but there are a number of assumptions being made when it comes to the so-called family safety net, says Sirr: \u201cOne is that people have families to move back to, and there\u2019s also an assumption that parents want them back, which quite often they don\u2019t.\u201d As well as that, \u201cyour parents might be living in Ventry, in Kerry, and you might be working in Dublin\u201d, he says. In many such cases, \u201chaving parents that you can move back in with is irrelevant\u201d. We spoke to renters about how the precarious rental market affects their lives. \u2018It\u2019s just not having your own space and being able to do things without disturbing the other person\u2019 Joshua Manuel-Oni (29), Dublin Joshua Manuel-Oni grew up in Waterford and has rented in and around Dublin since he moved there in 2012 to pursue an undergraduate degree at University College Dublin. Now working in the tech industry, he rents a room with one other person in a two-bedroom apartment in a north Dublin suburb. The area is further outside the city than he would like, but the room was available within his price range at the time. Although lucky with his current housemate, Manuel-Oni says he has had some awkward experiences living with strangers in the past. One, for example, would have people over and blare music late into the night; another did not uphold his standards of cleanliness, especially in their shared bathroom. It\u2019s still tough to share even when you have a like-minded housemate, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not having your own space and being able to do things without disturbing the other person.\u201d Living outside the city, shortcomings in public transport also affect him daily. \u201cThe two biggest things I have to spend money on each month is housing and transport, and if those were substantially reduced and if transport was improved, I would see Ireland as this nearly amazing, perfect, wonderful place to live. But those two things make it so difficult,\u201d he says. It\u2019s so difficult to try and save and be renting at the same time and you have to really reduce your quality of life, especially if you want to do it by yourself\u2014 Joshua Manuel-Oni When Manuel-Oni rented with his siblings for a few years it felt \u201crelatively good\u201d. But since they have moved on to different places, \u201cthings have always felt temporary\u201d. When a room he was renting came with a mattress too small for him, his precarious situation presented him with a dilemma which is repeated any time the need for a big purchase arises: \u201cYou think, \u2018If I\u2019m going to be here for like, five years, what\u2019s \u20ac200 over five years for a mattress? \u2013 it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 But if you think, \u2018I\u2019m going to be here for six months or one year or two years, should I buy something now and move it a lot, or do I wait until my next place?\u2019 \u2013 and there was always that feeling.\u201d Being able to buy a home eventually doesn\u2019t seem realistic, Manuel-Oni says: \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to try and save and be renting at the same time and you have to really reduce your quality of life, especially if you want to do it by yourself. \u201cEven if there were places I could afford, they wouldn\u2019t be anywhere where I would want to live, where maybe my friends and family are, so it doesn\u2019t seem like a realistic thing at the moment.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m working in a Government job, and I feel so abandoned and neglected\u2019 Laura* (31), Dublin *\u201dLaura\u201d (not her real name) wished to have her anonymity preserved for fear her search for housing in the private rental sector would be affected. In May of this year, Laura presented as homeless for the third time to her local council after being evicted from an apartment she had rented for five years in Dublin when her landlord decided to sell it. Between her shifts as a Government agency employee, often working nights, Laura has spent a number of weeks sleeping in her car. \u201cI just do not feel safe up there,\u201d she says of the emergency accommodation provided by the State, where she was offered a bunk in a room shared with two other women. She felt uncomfortable with having to disturb the other women as she came and went from work at odd hours, and was most put off by the policy of accommodation-centre staff entering the room at night, she says, \u201cto check no one has OD\u2019d [overdosed]\u201d. Laura has had to park in different areas to remain inconspicuous to residents, moving between housing estates, the Phoenix Park and a spot close to her old apartment where her car was parked for years, \u201cso I feel safe there,\u201d she says. At 5ft in height, she says she lies across the back seats to try to sleep. Apart from going to work, where Laura hasn\u2019t talked to her colleagues about her situation because she wants it to remain a place where she can forget about her living situation, the gym is the only other place she can go to avoid the car, and to exercise and use the shower facilities. The rest of her time and energy is consumed by the search for accommodation, constantly checking property listings for rooms, flats, studios and apartments with a rent she could afford to pay on top of her Housing Assistance Payment (Hap) allowance. She has so far been to \u201ca good few viewings\u201d, she says, but has had \u201cabsolutely no luck\u201d. As well as navigating the private rental sector, Laura has been on the waiting list for social housing since she was 19, and must log on every Friday to the council\u2019s \u201cchoice-based letting\u201d platform to apply for social housing for which she is eligible. She believes she has applied for at least 400 homes over 12 years. The uncertainty of possibly having to move again is constant\u2014 Laura \u201cI said this to Threshold the other day, like, the trauma... I was dreaming about [former taoiseach] Leo Varadkar the other night, I was dreaming I was shouting at him. I\u2019m definitely going through some sort of PTSD, especially the fact that it\u2019s my third time [presenting as homeless], that I\u2019m working in a Government job, and I feel so abandoned and neglected and forgotten about.\u201d Laura says she has no family safety net. Her father lives in a nursing home in England and her mother, she says, is as \u201ca survivor\u201d of an industrial school in the capital \u201cand that led her into a life of addiction, basically due to the trauma that the State put her generation through\u201d. \u201cIt makes me so angry when I think about that because [of] the generational impact that those [industrial schools] have had... That\u2019s the generational impact that it\u2019s had on my family. And I\u2019m trying to pull myself out of it so much. I\u2019m trying to pull myself out of it for years.\u201d [ Housing crisis: \u2018We lived on \u20ac20 a week. We saved absolutely everything. There was no avocado toast\u2019 ] Laura is wary that even if she does find a rental property, it could just be a matter of time before she finds herself in the same position: \u201cI\u2019m constantly living with the fear that it can just happen again, because as long as it takes for the council to offer me a property, the landlords can just keep selling.\u201d Update: Since we spoke to Laura, she has secured an apartment in the private rental sector after living in her car for almost a month and is \u201cover the moon\u201d, although, she says, \u201cthe uncertainty of possibly having to move again is constant\u201d. \u2018We were angry at the fact [the landlord] didn\u2019t talk to us about it, and just sent an eviction notice\u2019 Jamie Coleman (44), Cork city Having been evicted from a house in Cork city when the landlord decided to return home from a brief stint living abroad, taxi driver Jamie Coleman and his partner, Justyna Byczkowiak (36), who works for an ecommerce company, settled for a new rental property that was \u201ca bit of a dive\u201d, Coleman says. Along with their two daughters and Coleman\u2019s son, the family decided they would turn the place into a home when the landlord informally told them they could stay there for six years until his own child was due to return from studying abroad, Coleman says. \u201cWe did up the house at our own expense and we ended up fully furnishing it, so we borrowed money and bought everything. There was only one thing kept, and that was a coffee table, nothing else. I think it was about \u20ac15,000 that we borrowed.\u201d They put a lot of work into the house, filling in dents in the walls and painting it throughout: \u201cThe neighbours thought we were after buying it,\u201d he says. Coleman developed an informal relationship with the landlord. They would chat to each other about their lives, and he told him how much the family loved the property and asked him about the possibility of buying it from him. \u201cHe said that he wouldn\u2019t say no to it, because I told him I can\u2019t get a mortgage but I knew I could afford it if we did a deal. And I said you can laugh at me now or tell me it\u2019s not possible, but he said everything is possible, so we\u2019ll talk at the time.\u201d We\u2019ve no security. Even though we\u2019re very happy here, we love it \u2013 we do not feel secure\u2014 Jamie Coleman Unfortunately for Coleman and Byczkowiak, that possibility was quashed when they received an eviction notice five and a half years after they first moved in, just before they were about to set out on a family holiday. \u201cInitially we panicked,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cWe were angry at the fact that he didn\u2019t talk to us about it, and just sent us a solicitor\u2019s eviction notice.\u201d Coleman says he then sent the landlord a letter, and when that went unanswered, a text, to ask once again if the couple could buy the house. The landlord told Coleman that he would not be selling the property, and that he would be moving into it himself. [ My landlord is not acting on a ruling from the Residential Tenancies Board. What can I do? ] Coleman later found out from their former neighbours that a different tenant had moved into the house after they had vacated it, not the landlord himself. The couple then decided to take a case against the landlord to the RTB as he had failed to identify the intended occupant of the property. They sought guidance from Threshold, who talked them through the process. An RTB adjudicator determined that the landlord was liable to pay the couple \u20ac8,378 for \u201cbreach of landlord obligations pursuant to section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004\". The family have found a new rental house in the countryside that they are happy with, but it\u2019s less convenient than where they were, and their teenagers now rely on them for lifts to see their friends. Coleman says the couple can\u2019t get a mortgage because \u201cwe have a lot of overheads\u201d, and \u201cwe find it difficult to get a loan\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got kids, we try to give them as best a life we can,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously when we have to watch money, we watch money, but, like, our youngest child, she goes to dancing class, she goes swimming as well \u2013 that all costs money. Our older daughter, she goes horse riding, that\u2019s the one thing that she loves is horses, and we try our best to not take that away. \u201cThankfully we\u2019re on the housing list,\u201d Coleman adds, \u201cbut again, there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d He says a letter written by his neurologist describing the detrimental effect that stress has on him as someone living with multiple sclerosis \u201cmade no difference\u201d to their position on the list. Recently, upon receiving a registered letter from the letting agency that deals with their current house, \u201cour hearts sank\u201d he continues. Thinking it could be yet another eviction notice, \u201cwe both instantly felt sick\u201d, he says, but it turned out to be notice of a routine building inspection. \u201cWe constantly have that feeling. We\u2019ve no security. Even though we\u2019re very happy here, we love it \u2013 we do not feel secure. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re just waiting. Like, when\u2019s it going to happen next?\u201d \u2018It\u2019s just madness that we\u2019re paying rents that are the same as a mortgage, but we can\u2019t get mortgages\u2019 Eliza Kelly (31), Galway city Eliza Kelly from Kildare has rented in Galway city since 2012, when she first moved there to study. She now works in a gym as a personal trainer and rents a room in an apartment she shares with two others in the city centre. It can be awkward, she says of her current accommodation, because her landlord rents rooms out separately, so she has no say in who she will be living with, although it has worked out so far. \u201cIt might be all right when you\u2019re in college or younger, but when you\u2019re a bit older you don\u2019t really want to live with different people every six months.\u201d Kelly says her housing situation always \u201cfeels a bit temporary\u201d and \u201cthe rug can be pulled out from under you \u2013 you\u2019re settled, and then someone decides to move, or the landlord decides to sell and then you\u2019re out looking for a house again\u201d. We can\u2019t get mortgages, even though I\u2019ve been paying rent for the last 12 years\u2014 Eliza Kelly She considers herself lucky to be paying rent at the rate she is at the moment. \u201cThe first room I rented was \u20ac375, and then this one is \u20ac550 [a month]. That\u2019s not even doubled, but I\u2019d say most people would be nearly paying double what they paid 10 years ago.\u201d If she were to be evicted from her current place, she wouldn\u2019t even look at renting again in Galway city, with current rent prices as high as they are, she says. (At time of writing there were 99 listings for rooms in shared houses in the Galway city area on Daft.ie, with prices starting from \u20ac600 a month, up to \u20ac1,100 per month.) \u201cIt\u2019s just madness that we\u2019re paying rent that are the same as a mortgage, but we can\u2019t get mortgages, even though I\u2019ve been paying rent for the last 12 years,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cYou would assume that would be a suitable track record for a bank, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cAnd the whole dog situation,\u201d she adds with a sigh \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t really have a dog.\u201d \u2018I won\u2019t be allowed to borrow enough for a house, so I\u2019ll have to bring more to the table\u2019 David* (38), Cork city *\u2018David\u2019 wished to have his anonymity preserved for the privacy of those close to him. David, an IT worker from Cork city, last year moved in with his parents, who are in their 70s, after his marriage ended. He and his ex-wife had been renting a home together in the city with their young son, who has an intellectual disability; as his ex-wife is a full-time carer for their son, she is applying for State financial assistance to continue to rent the house for herself and their son. Although David earns about \u20ac75,000 a year, he has not yet been able buy a house. When he queried his mortgage eligibility with a bank, he was surprised to hear his child maintenance payments for were regarded as a long-term loan, and therefore his allowable income would qualify him for a mortgage of about \u20ac170,000. I will most likely have to have far in excess of a normal 10 per cent deposit because I won\u2019t be allowed to borrow enough for a house\u2014 David \u201cSo that\u2019s not going to be enough to be able to afford a house on my own anyway, realistically, unless I go far away... and I have an anchor with regards to where my son lives, because of where his school is \u2013 I can\u2019t go too far,\u201d he says. The second issue he faces is being able to save enough to buy: \u201cI will most likely have to have far in excess of a normal 10 per cent deposit because I won\u2019t be allowed to borrow enough for a house, so I\u2019ll have to bring more to the table.\u201d In the meantime, because his son understands his grandparents\u2019 house to be a place he visits rather than a place where he stays over, David has to stay at his ex-wife\u2019s home to be with him whenever she stays with family. He remains hopeful things will work out, however, with the goal of having a stable base for him and his son in sight. \u201cAt the moment he has one house that he knows is his place \u2013 ideally in a couple of years I\u2019d like him to have two.\u201d Tenants in need of free and confidential advice on housing issues can freephone Threshold on 1800454454 or visit threshold.ie/get-help.

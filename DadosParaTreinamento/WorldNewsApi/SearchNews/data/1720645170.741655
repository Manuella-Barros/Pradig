The average price has dropped 35 cents over the past 26 days, including 2 cents Friday, according to figures from the AAA and Oil Price Information Service. The average price dropped 13 consecutive days, rose one- tenth of a cent May 27 and resumed declining the next day. The average price is 11.7 cents less than one week ago and 38.1 cents lower than one month ago but unchanged from one year ago. It has dropped $1.516 since rising to a record $6.435 on Oct. 5, 2022.

It has dropped $1.56 since rising to a record $5.016 on June 14, 2022. \u201cThis drop in pump prices appears to have some sticking power for now,\u201d said Andrew Gross, an AAA national public relations manager. \u201cMore states should see their averages dip below $3 a gallon in the coming weeks.\u201d The California average price for a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline was $4.943 Saturday, the highest in the nation. The reasons for the highest price include the nation\u2019s highest gasoline taxes, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the special blend of gasoline required to be sold in the state that reduces pollution. \u2013City News Service", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"Union 76 fuel pump\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/timesofsand", "url": "https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2024/06/08/average-san-diego-county-gas-price-drops-for-25th-time-in-26-days-4-91-self-serve-regular/", "image": "https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_6543-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:14:17", "author": "Debbie L.

Dr Saleyha Ahsan fronts BBC's Trust Me, I'm A Doctor, with her often working alongside Dr Mosley, whose wife confirmed his body was found in Greece on Sunday. While appearing on Sky News, she described him as \"hugely talented\" while getting emotional. Speaking on live television, she said: \"I can now appreciate that's a one-off, not everyone is able to make other people feel so at ease with lights and cameras in front of them.\" She went on: \"But then to forget about all of that and just to focus on the science, on the story, on the message that we're trying to get out, is such a talented man, hugely talented.\" This comes after it was confirmed this morning that a body had been found in the search and rescue operation for the missing TV doctor. Michael, who often appeared on TV shows like This Morning, vanished during the week near a hiking trail on a Greek island while on holiday with his wife, Clare. Amid the extensive search operation led by emergency workers for Michael, a body was discovered in a rocky area beside Agia Marina on Symi on Sunday. It is thought to have been there for several days. Just mere hours before a body was found amid the search, Michael's wife Clare said: \"We will not lose hope.\" A local cameraman, Antonios, who found the body this morning, broke down in tears when he spoke on Sky News this morning. He became emotional when he spoke of how the body they found matched the description of Mosley. He explained how they took a photo of the screen with an iPhone before zooming in and being able to \"clearly see\" that it was a man \"lying down\" with \"his hand on his belly\". He then said: \"The description is exactly of the guy we were looking for.\" He broke down and emotionally added: \"I'm really sorry for the family, I'm sorry that I'm the one to find him. I wish we had better news.\" *Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Michael Mosley's BBC co-star, Dr Saleyha Ahsan, has broken her silence on his death in emotional live scenes while appearing on Sky News today", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/michael-mosleys-bbc-co-star-32992458", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32992451.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sky-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:43:35", "author": "Mollie Quirk,Mollie-Quirk", "authors": ["Mollie Quirk", "Mollie-Quirk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.334}

{"id": 223701226, "title": "Hundreds of Infected Blood Victims Suing Government Over \u2018Misfeasance\u2019", "text": "Victims of the infected blood scandal have restarted legal action against the government, with their lawyer claiming there was a \u201cmisfeasance in public office.\u201d The civil litigation, brought against the secretary of state for health, concerns imported blood-clotting products which caused haemophiliacs and others to be infected with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s. It was put on hold in November 2018 but has been relaunched following the publication of the Infected Blood Inquiry report, with around 500 victims putting their name to the lawsuit. Sir Brian Langstaff\u2019s 2,527-page report found the scandal \u201ccould largely have been avoided\u201d and that there was a \u201cpervasive\u201d cover-up to hide the truth. Des Collins, senior partner at Collins Solicitors\u2014which represents 1,500 victims, said: \u201cWhat we did say when we launched this action was that everything the government had done was wrong and not only was it wrong, they covered it up and lied about it. \u201cAnd of course, the report supports that view that the victims took all those years ago. \u201cSo it\u2019s an action against the government for misfeasance in public office.\u201d In a separate action, around 50 former pupils of Lord Mayor Treloar College, where boys with haemophilia were given contaminated blood in the 1970s and 80s, are suing the specialist school for an alleged failure of its duty of care. Of the pupils that attended the Lord Mayor Treloar College in the 1970s and 1980s \u201cvery few escaped being infected\u201d and of the 122 pupils with haemophilia that attended the school between 1970 and 1987, only 30 are still alive. The report found children were used as \u201cobjects for research\u201d while the risks of contracting hepatitis and HIV were ignored. Survivors, known as the Treloar\u2019s boys, said in a joint statement that \u201cthere is nothing honourable about what happened\u201d at the school, calling on former headmaster Alexander Macpherson to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and return his OBE. Mr. Macpherson was headmaster from 1974 to 1990. Steve Nicholls, 57, from Farnham, Surrey, who attended the school between 1976 and 1983, said: \u201cWe fully accept that Treloar\u2019s is a unique case. \u201cWe have been referred to as the darkest chapter within the Infected Blood Inquiry and for us to get recognition and justice for all the haemophiliac boys and their families we feel it is necessary to pursue it through the courts now.\u201d On Mr. Macpherson, he added: \u201cSomeone has to take accountability, it happened on his watch, he was responsible for his staff and the wellbeing of his pupils. \u201cOur parents handed over the care of us, their children, giving Treloar\u2019s full loco parentis of their child and they chose to withhold very important information that could have saved their son\u2019s lives. \u201cThat was a choice \u2026 they knew what they were doing, they chose to not contact those parents and give those parents a choice of the treatment and keep them fully up to speed of what was actually going on behind those four walls.\u201d On that legal action, Mr. Collins said: \u201cIt\u2019s the deliberate killing of 70 or 80 pupils, which you can only say quickly because it\u2019s so horrendous if you actually dwell on the words.\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the exploitation of children at Treloar\u2019s a source of \u201ceternal shame\u201d that is \u201chard to even comprehend\u201d in a statement to the House of Commons last week. Mr. Sunak issued a \u201cwholehearted and unequivocal\u201d apology to the victims of the biggest treatment disaster in the NHS, vowing that \u201ccomprehensive\u201d compensation will be delivered \u201cwhatever it costs.\u201d According to government documents, people living with an HIV infection as a result of the scandal could receive between \u00a32.2 million and \u00a32.6 million. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing legal cases.\u201d Treloar\u2019s has been approached for comment.", "summary": "Around 500 victims have put their name to the lawsuit.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/hundreds-of-infected-blood-victims-suing-government-over-misfeasance-5628992", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/26/id5657399-featureimage-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:27:55", "author": "Pa Media", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.633}

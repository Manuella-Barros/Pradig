Lord Sumption and Lord Collins were two of five of British judges - all of whom are retired from their UK roles - listed as overseas non-permanent judges for the court of final appeal, who could be selected at any time to sit on cases.\n\nLord Collins, who has served since 2011, cited the \"political situation\" in Hong Kong as his reason for stepping down from the court. Lord Sumption, who was appointed to the court in 2019, told The Independent he would make a statement next week about his resignation.\n\nLord Collins told The Independent: \"I have resigned from the Court of Final Appeal because of the political situation in Hong Kong, but I continue to have the fullest confidence in the Court and the total independence of its members.\"\n\nBritish judges have sat on the court since 1997 on a non-permanent basis as part of an agreement when the city was handed back to China by the UK. The intention was to help preserve the rule of law, provide expertise to local lawyers and reassure businesses and financial markets.\n\nHuman rights groups have criticised Western judges for continuing to serve on Hong Kong's top court, which still includes judges from the UK, Canada and Australia. More than 1,800 political prisoners have been detained in Hong Kong in a crackdown on dissent since mass pro-democracy protests in 2019. This has expanded since the passing of a China-imposed national security law by the city's pro-Beijing legislature in 2020, although the British judges cannot rule on national security law cases.\n\nThe Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation have previously accused the Western judges on the of lending \"their prestige to a justice system that has been undermined and co-opted by Beijing\".\n\nLast week, 14 pro-democracy activists were found guilty of charges of subversion under the national security law in a Hong Kong court, a decision which Amnesty International described as a \"near-total purge\" of Hong Kong's political opposition.\n\nIn 2022, two of the UK's most senior current judges, Supreme Court justices Lord Robert Reed and Lord Patrick Hodge resigned from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the basis that continuing to serve on it would appear to endorse Hong Kong's pro-Beijing administration.\n\nIn a statement, Lord Reed said on behalf of himself and Lord Hodge: \"I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the Supreme Court cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong.\n\n\"It would appear to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression, to which the Justices of the Supreme Court are deeply committed.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

One cites the city's 'political situation'", "body": "HONG KONG (AP) -- Two British judges have resigned from Hong Kong's top court, the city's judiciary said Thursday, deepening worries over the city's rule of law under a Beijing-imposed national security law.\n\nThe judiciary said in a statement that Jonathan Sumption and Lawrence Collins, who both serve as non-permanent overseas judges of Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal, have tendered their resignations to the city leader. But it did not give further details about their decisions.\n\nCollins told The Associated Press that his resignation was \"because of the political situation in Hong Kong.\" But he said he continues \"to have the fullest confidence in the court and the total independence of its members.\"\n\nSumption said he would make a statement next week.\n\nHong Kong, a former British colony, is a common law jurisdiction, unlike mainland China. After it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, non-permanent overseas judges have consistently served on the city's top court.\n\nThe pair's resignations are an indicator of confidence in the city's rule of law and judicial independence, especially after the enactment of the 2020 national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Many pro-democracy activists have been arrested under the law, including some of the city's best-known democracy advocates.\n\nLast week, a Hong Kong court found 14 pro-democracy activists guilty of conspiring to commit subversion in what was the city's biggest national security case to date. They were among 47 activists who were accused of attempting to paralyze Hong Kong's government and topple the city's leader by securing the legislative majority necessary to indiscriminately veto budgets.\n\nCritics said the convictions showed how the sweeping security law is being used against dissidents in the city. But Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the law helped bring back stability to the city following huge anti-government protests in 2019. Hong Kong officials have repeatedly insisted the city's judicial independence is being protected.\n\nIn March, the Hong Kong government enacted a new, home-grown security law, raising more concerns over the city's erosion of freedoms.\n\nThe two judges' resignations are not the first in the city. Months after the security law was enacted in June 2020, Australian judge James Spigelman told Australia's national broadcaster that he quit the city's top court for reasons \"related to the content of the national security legislation.\"\n\nIn 2021, British judge Baroness Brenda Hale also said she would quit the city's highest court when her first term ended.\n\nIn 2022, two other British judges, Robert Reed and Patrick Hodge, stepped down too. At that time, Reed said he agreed with the British government that judges of the U.K. Supreme Court \"cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression.\"\n\nIn response, then-city leader Carrie Lam expressed regrets over the resignations of Reed and Hodge. But she refuted any allegations that associated their resignations with the introduction of the security law or the exercise of freedom of speech and political freedom in Hong Kong.", "source":

For decades, they were seen as lending prestige and expertise to a jurisdiction admired across Asia.\n\nBut in recent years, as the Chinese government has tightened its grip on Hong Kong, there have been calls for the overseas judges to resign.\n\nIn 2022, Robert Reed, the president of the UK supreme court, and his colleague Patrick Hodge, resigned from the Hong Kong bench because of concerns about endorsing an administration that appeared to have \"departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression\".\n\nLord Sumption had previously told the Guardian that he joined the Hong Kong court to \"serve the people of Hong Kong\" and that the departure of overseas judges would not be helpful to them. He is yet to make a statement about his resignation on Thursday.\n\nAlyssa Fong, the public affairs advocacy manager for the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said that the news was \"extremely welcome\".\n\nFong said: \"We have long advocated that no foreign judges should continue to give any form of credibility to the Hong Kong courts and authoritarian crackdown\" and called for the remaining judges to resign.\n\nSince the pro-democracy protests that rocked the city in 2019 and 2020, the authorities have imposed two national security laws on the territory. The first was imposed by Beijing in 2020, the second, known as article 23, was passed by Hong Kong's opposition-free parliament in March this year, with the first arrests coming in recent weeks. Legal experts, western governments and activists say that both laws are a blow to free expression in the city.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested under the 2020 national security law, including the British citizen Jimmy Lai, who is on trial on national security charges. This month, 14 people were found guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion in the biggest national security trial of pro-democracy activists, known as the \"Hong Kong 47\" (31 of the 47 had already pleaded guilty).\n\nThe Hong Kong 47 trial was presided over by a panel of judges hand-picked by the chief executive to handle national security cases. The involvement of the Beijing-backed chief executive in choosing judges for national security cases - which can be heard without a jury - raises questions about the robustness of the English common law system, which dictates that the judiciary should be independent from the government.\n\nA spokesperson for the Hong Kong judiciary said: \"Chief Justice Andrew Cheung of the Hong Kong court of final appeal notes with regret the resignations of Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption as non-permanent judges of the Hong Kong court of final appeal.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that Lords Collins and Sumption had \"have made valuable contributions to the work of the court for which we in Hong Kong are very grateful\".\n\n\"The chief justice has complete confidence that the CFA will continue to fully perform its constitutional role as the final appellate court in Hong Kong. Its operation will not be affected by any change in membership of the court.\"\n\nThe last remaining British judges on the CFA are Lennie Hoffmann, David Neuberger, and Nick Phillips. Lord Neuberger will be part of a panel that hears an appeal from Lai and other pro-democracy activists in a case regarding an unlawful assembly conviction later this month.", "source": {"uri":

He added that he continued to have the \"fullest confidence\" in the court and the independence of its members.\n\nSumption confirmed he had resigned from the court in a separate message to Bloomberg News, saying that he would make a statement next week.

Collins gave no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe resignations add to the number of British jurists who have severed their ties to Hong Kong's highest court amid a years-long crackdown on dissent under a China-imposed national security law in 2020 following mass pro-democracy protests.\n\nRobert Reed, who resigned from the CFA in 2022, said at the time he couldn't continue to \"sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom and freedom of expression.\"\n\nBritain, which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, has said the security law that punishes offences like subversion with up to life imprisonment has been used to curb dissent and freedoms.\n\nMany of the city's democratic campaigners have been arrested, detained or forced into exile, civil society groups have been shuttered and liberal media outlets forced to close.\n\nLast week, 14 pro-democracy activists were found guilty and two were acquitted in a landmark subversion trial that critics say further undermined the city's rule of law and its reputation as a global financial hub.\n\nThe verdicts in Hong Kong's biggest trial against the democratic opposition came more than three years after police arrested 47 democrats in dawn raids at homes across the city. They were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under a national security law imposed by China.\n\nChinese and Hong Kong authorities say the law is necessary and has brought stability.\n\nThe presence of foreign judges in Hong Kong is enshrined in the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that guarantees the global financial hub's freedoms and extensive autonomy under Chinese rule, including the continuation of Hong Kong\u00b4s common law traditions forged during the colonial era.\n\nThere are still several British judges sitting as non-permanent overseas judges in the CFA including David Neuberger, and Nick Phillips, as well as those from other common law jurisdictions including Australia.

"body": "Two former Supreme Court judges have quit Hong Kong's highest court amid concerns over China's crackdown on human rights.\n\nLord Jonathan Sumption and Lord Lawrence Collins stepped down from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (HKFCA) this week.\n\nIt comes as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong through a controversial national security law, which was introduced in 2020 to curb mass anti-government protests.\n\nJust last month 14 pro-democracy activists were convicted of subversion in Hong Kong, sparking renewed attacks against the erosion of liberty.\n\nLord Collins, who has been overseeing cases in the Far East since 2011, said he had resigned because of the \"political situation in Hong Kong\", although he stopped short of criticising the court.\n\nHe said: \"I continue to have the fullest confidence in the court and the total independence of its members.\"\n\nLord Sumption, who was appointed to the HKFCA in 2019, said he would deliver a statement on his decision \"in due course\", as reported by the Financial Times.\n\nThe pair's departure will increase scrutiny on the role of UK judges in Hong Kong, where they have sat ever since the territory was returned to China in 1997.\n\nHaving Britain's most senior judges overruling cases involving civil and political freedoms in Hong Kong was previously seen as a boon to Britain's national interests.\n\nHowever, their roles have come under increasing pressure amid heightened tensions between China and the West.\n\nThe committee for freedom in Hong Kong Foundation last month said Australian, British and Canadian judges sitting on the HKFCA were lending \"their prestige to a justice system that has been undermined and co-opted by Beijing\".\n\nThe latest resignations follow similar moves by Lord Robert Reed and Lord Patrick Hodge in 2022, both of whom were also members of the UK Supreme Court.\n\nAt the time, Lord Reed said Supreme Court judges sitting in Hong Kong risked endorsing an administration which had \"departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression\".\n\nThis led to subsequent criticism by Carrie Lam, former chief executive of Hong Kong, who attacked \"unfounded allegations\" relating to the national security law.\n\nThe pair followed Lady Brenda Hale, the former Supreme Court president who announced her plans to withdraw from the HKFCA in 2021.\n\nLord David Neuberger and Lord Nicholas Phillips, both previous UK Supreme Court presidents, are the only former British judges still serving on HKFCA.\n\nSeparately, US law firms have also recently been winding down their operations in Hong Kong amid Beijing's crackdown on foreign businesses, which has been carried out through anti-espionage and data security laws.\n\nMayer Brown, which is headquartered in Chicago but employs hundreds of lawyers in London, last month announced plans to spin off Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing offices from its global network.\n\nUS law firms Sidley Austin, Latham & Watkins and Akin Gump have similarly reduced their businesses in mainland China.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

After it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, non-permanent overseas judges have consistently served on the city's top court.\n\nThe pair's resignations are an indicator of confidence in the city's rule of law and judicial independence, especially after the enactment of the 2020 national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Many pro-democracy activists have been arrested under the law, including some of the city's best-known democracy advocates.\n\nLast week, a Hong Kong court found 14 pro-democracy activists guilty of conspiring to commit subversion in what was the city's biggest national security case to date. They were among 47 activists who were accused of attempting to paralyze Hong Kong's government and topple the city's leader by securing the legislative majority necessary to indiscriminately veto budgets.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-democracy_camp_(Hong_Kong)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong national security law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Hong Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/xclh125-the-associated-press.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631025", "eventUri": "eng-9631025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

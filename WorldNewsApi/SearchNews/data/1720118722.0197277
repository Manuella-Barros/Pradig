Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti said she had advised her friend to \u201ctake some time to consider what she wants to do\u201d. She also hit out at what she denounced as a \u201csordid week of unauthorised anonymous briefings by overgrown schoolboys in suits with their feet on the table\u201d who had watched \u201ctoo much West Wing\u201d. Her comments came as Labour denied offering MPs, including Ms Abbott, seats in the House of Lords to stand down. On Friday Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Ms Abbot was \u201cfree\u201d to stand as a Labour candidate in the general election, after days of back and forth about whether the veteran MP would be blocked. He also praised her as a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d, saying that after she was elected the first black woman MP in the UK she \u201ccarved a path for other people\u201d. The dramatic U-turn came after Sir Keir\u2019s deputy Angela Rayner said Ms Abbott should be allowed to stand \u2013 in a break with her party leader. But Baroness Chakrabarti hit out an anonymous briefings earlier in the week that the London MP would be barred from standing, despite getting the party whip. Ms Abbott had been suspended after she suggested Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience prejudice, but not racism. Baroness Chakrabarti told BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg it had been a \u201csometimes sordid week of unauthorised anonymous briefings by overgrown schoolboys in suits with their feet on the table, maybe watching too much West Wing but not taking on its more progressive values.\u201d The baroness added that \u201cit\u2019s been pretty appalling, trying to bully someone of her stature\u201d, and \u201cit\u2019s not good for Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s not good for the Labour Party, and it hasn\u2019t been very hasn\u2019t been very nice for Diane and for common decency\u201d. She said she had advised her to \u201ctake some time to consider what she wants to do\u201d. Shadow home secretary Yvette said she would \u201cobviously support\u201d Ms Abbott if she decided to stand for Labour, as she denied peerages had been offered during an attempted purge of left-wing MPs. No party can \u201cmake those sorts of commitments\u201d and promise peerages, Ms Cooper said. A number of former Labour MPs, including Ms Abbott, have been offered peerages to quit and open up seats for allies of Sir Keir, according to reports in The Sunday Times. Ms Cooper told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole process with the independent committee that will vet nominations, there have to be processes in terms of the numbers of nominations, designated by the Prime Minister and so on. \u201cSo, no party can do that or make those sorts of commitments.\u201d She added: \u201cIt has to be Diane\u2019s decision. I did listen to what Shami said. In fact, Shami, who\u2019s very close to Diane, is saying this is for Diane to decide and I completely support that. \u201cDiane has been - continues to be - a really important figure in the Labour Party, not just because of the trailblazing people have talked about, but also some of the things she did, for example she was crucial to exposing the Windrush scandal and holding the government to account on that.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti said she had advised her friend to \u2018take some time to consider what she wants to do\u2019 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-stand-labour-mp-peerage-b2555260.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/31/13/c548e76530864de1dcb3b20062e6ad91Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MjQ0MjA3-2.75610867.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:32:32", "author": "Kate Devlin", "authors": ["Kate Devlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.137}

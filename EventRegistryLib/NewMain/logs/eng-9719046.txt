The trainee officer, who used a red-blue beacon light and VIP number plates on her private Audi car, has recently sparked a controversy on social media. Let us know the whole matter in detail.\n\nKhedkar is accused of allegedly submitting fake disability and Other Backward Classes (OBC) certificates to pass the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam. The matter came into discussion when the officer, who was completing her probation, was transferred from Pune to Washim after complaints of misuse of position.\n\nAn official said that Khedkar appeared for the civil services exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories. She also submitted a mental illness certificate.\n\nIn April 2022, she was required to report to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, for verification of her disability certificate. However, she did not comply, citing a Covid infection, the official added.\n\nThe official said that Pooja Khedkar's father, Dilip Khedkar, a former state government officer, had declared assets worth Rs 40 crore while contesting the recent Lok Sabha election. However, Pooja Khedkar appeared for the civil services exam under the OBC category, where the limit for the creamy layer certificate is an annual parental income of Rs 8 lakh.\n\nAfter joining as a probationary officer in Pune, Khedkar allegedly made several demands, such as requesting a VIP number plate for an Audi car and installing a red beacon on the vehicle.\n\nKhedkar, who was posted in Pune, was transferred to Washim district in central Maharashtra before completing her training due to controversy surrounding her requests for amenities such as a separate cabin and staff.\n\nPuja Khedkar, a 2023-batch IAS officer, has been transferred to Washim to complete the remaining term of her training and she will serve there as a \"supernumerary assistant collector\" till July 30, 2025, said the official letter.\n\nAccording to a report submitted by Pune collector Suhas Diwse to the General Administration Department, even before starting duty on June 3, Khedkar repeatedly requested a separate cabin, car, residential quarters, and a peon.

Pooja Khedkar (Puja Khedkar), the IAS probationer, was reportedly transferred after she demanded an official car with a VIP number plate, among other things that are not given to probationary officers.\n\nAccording to news reports, Pooja Khedkar (Puja Khedkar) was transferred from Pune to Washim on Monday evening, July 8. While the government order stated that the transfer was for administrative reasons, reports suggest that Pooja Khedkar's (Puja Khedkar) demands led to her transfer. Sources close to the development also said that the IAS probationer will likely face an enquiry after several complaints were received against her.

She is also said to have demanded an exclusive chamber with adequate staff to attend to her. However, her demands created controversy and took many by surprise. It is also reported that as a probationary officer, Pooja Khedkar (Puja Khedkar) was not entitled to use a beacon light on a vehicle.\n\nHowever, the trainee IAS officer used the same on her private vehicle. While Pooja Khedkar (Puja Khedkar) was not entitled to an official car or staff and quarters, the probationary officer put forth her demand, which seems to be the reason for her transfer. The 32-year-old IAS trainer officer was posted as an assistant collector with the Pune district collector's office.\n\nPooja Khedkar (Puja Khedkar) placed 841st in the country in the main civil services examinations. A few reports also claimed that Khedkar's demands were supported by her father, Diliprao Khedkar, a retired administrative officer. It is alleged that Diliprao Khedkar pressurised the District Collector's Office staff and even threatened them with consequences if his daughter's demands were not met.

She is going to be the supernumerary assistant collector for Washim now.\n\nFollowing a letter to the Chief Secretary from Pune Collector Dr. Suhas Diwase, this action was taken. The order stated, \"The 2023 batch IAS officer will serve the remaining period of her probation as super numerary assistant collector in Washim district.\"\n\nAfter asking the Collector's office for special rights that were not granted to probation officers, Khedkar courted controversy. Distressing the administration, she also drove her private Audi with a VIP number plate and a red-blue beacon light. In her personal vehicle, she had also put a sign that read \"Maharashtra government.\" In addition, Khedkar made unjustified demands for accommodations, a constable, an official chamber staffed by enough people, and an official car with a VIP number plate.\n\nRules state that a trainee must be appointed as a gazetted officer before receiving any of the aforementioned benefits. That was not where Khedkar stopped, though. When additional collector Ajay More was away, she also took over his antechamber and posted a sign bearing her name.\n\nUnauthorised removal of all materials, including couches, tables, and chairs, was carried out by Khedkar, who achieved an All India Rank (AIR) of 841 in the UPSC.

What's The Controversy She's Embroiled In?", "body": "Puja Khedkar is a 2023-batch IAS officer who secured an all-India rank (AIR) of 841 in her UPSC exams.\n\nPuja Khedkar, a probationary IAS officer in Maharashtra, is in the eye of a storm over alleged misuse of power. She was transferred from Pune to Washim after it came to light that she was using a private Audi car with a siren and VIP number plate -- privileges that are reserved for senior officials.\n\nWho is Puja Khedkar?\n\nMs Khedkar is a 2023-batch IAS officer who secured an all-India rank (AIR) 841 in the UPSC exam. She comes from a family dedicated to public service, with her father, Dilip Khedkar, being a retired administrative officer. Her actions, however, have put her in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.\n\nThe controversy\n\nMs Khedkar was using her private Audi - a luxury sedan - with a \"Government of Maharashtra\" sticker and a red-blue beacon in Pune. Even before joining as an assistant collector, she had demanded an official car with a VIP number plate, accommodation, an official chamber with adequate staff, and a constable. A trainee officer is not entitled to these privileges.\n\nReports suggest that her father, leveraging his position as a retired administrative officer, even pressured the District Collector's office to fulfill his daughter's demands. This influence extended to her workplace behaviour where she allegedly removed the nameplate of senior officer Ajay More in the Pune collector's office to use the space for herself.\n\nThese actions were seen as a misuse of power and resulted in her transfer from Pune to Washim.

IAS Dr Pooja Khedkar is facing such serious allegations. The Maharashtra government has transferred probationary IAS officer Dr. Pooja Khedkar from Pune to Washim following allegations of power misuse.

Documents presented to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) indicate that Dr. Khedkar showed that she took the UPSC exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories. Additionally, she provided a certificate for mental illness to secure her IAS posting.\n\nWhat Is The Controversy?\n\nIAS Khedkar is facing serious allegations of submitting fraudulent disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to gain entry into the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).\n\nKhedkar has been transferred to Washim after attracting controversy for seeking privileges she is not entitled to as a probationary officer. She landed in controversy after allegedly using a private Audi car equipped with a red-blue beacon light and VIP number plate with 'Maharashtra government' board on her personal vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, she reportedly requested an official car with a VIP number plate, accommodations, an official chamber with staff, and a constable.

Hindustan Times has seen the order. \"The 2023 batch IAS officer will serve the remaining period of her probation as super numerary assistant collector in Washim district,\" the order states.\n\nEarlier, Diwase had written to additional chief secretary Nitin Gadre requesting the latter to consider giving a posting to Khedkar, 32-year-old junior officer, in another district to avoid administrative complications. Diwase had also sought necessary action against Khedkar for her behaviour including aggressive treatment of junior staff, illegal occupation of the ante-chamber of additional collector Ajay More, and demand for additional staff among others.\n\nThe 25-page letter, a copy of which has been read by Hindustan Times, enclosed Khedkar's text messages to senior officers reflecting her assertive behaviour, and photographs showing the changes she made on her own in More's ante-chamber. Khedkar was seen sporting an amber beacon on her Audi (private car) and the same kept flashing during the day which is not allowed as per the norms. \"Her expectations appear unrealistic while she dealt with administrative officers and the staff at the collectorate,\" Diwase's letter dated June 24 stated.\n\nPuja Khedkar was once accompanied to the collectorate by her retired bureaucrat father, Dilip Khedkar. Subsequently, Dilip Khedkar allegedly threatened a senior officer on the phone that his daughter was being deliberately troubled and \"those doing it would pay the consequences in future\".\n\nDiwase's letter stated, \"In this entire episode, Puja Khedkar's father's behaviour is objectionable and deserves action.\"\n\nDespite repeated attempts, Puja Khedkar did not respond to calls and messages.\n\nAccording to officials, Puja Khedkar even occupied the ante-chamber of additional collector More and made it her own in the absence of the senior administrative official who had gone to Mumbai for official work from June 18 to June 20.\n\nThe IAS officer's conduct became a topic of discussion in administrative circles and on social media and complaints were addressed to senior bureaucratic officials regarding excessive demands made by her and her father, a former administrative officer. In one instance, the father-daughter duo complained to deputy collector Jyoti Kadam that Puja Khedkar had no support staff and that they would take up the matter at the highest level in Mumbai. Due to an increasing number of complaints against the probationary officer, the district collector wrote a strong letter to the chief secretary giving every detail of the incidents taking place at the district collector's office involving Khedkar.\n\nKhedkar joined as Indian revenue officer in 2020 but once again appeared for the IAS exam in 2022 and secured All India Rank 821. She got selected under a handicap (visually impaired) category and was subsequently posted in the Pune collectorate as assistant commissioner on probation on June 3. In one of her old videos on social media, Khedkar claimed that she had completed her medical education and only later decided to pursue a career as a bureaucrat.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washim district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/09/1600x900/Diwase-had-also-sought-necessary-action-against-Kh_1720549726488.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "dateEnd": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2178, "textEnd": 2196}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 1450, "textEnd": 1457}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 3183, "textEnd": 3189}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Before assuming her role as Assistant Collector in Pune, Khedkar demanded a separate office, a car, and a house. Her WhatsApp messages to an official at the collectorate show her instructing the arrangements be made before her joining date on June 3.\n\n\"Please ensure the designated cabin and vehicle are ready before I join on the 3rd. Later, there will be no time.

Although offered her own office chamber, Khedkar declined it due to the lack of an attached bathroom. She and her father, Dilip Khedkar, proposed using a VIP hall next to the mining department as her office.\n\nKhedkar was informed that, as a probationary officer, she was not entitled to such facilities and that accommodation would be provided. Following the District Collector's report, Khedkar, a 2023-batch IAS officer, was transferred to Washim district to complete her training. She has been appointed as the Assistant Collector in Washim and will serve as a 'supernumerary Assistant Collector' until July 30, 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Khedkar used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and a VIP number plate, and had installed a 'Maharashtra government' board on the vehicle.\n\nFollowing the controversy, it was revealed that Khedkar allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to pass the civil services examination. She appeared for the exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories and also submitted a mental illness certificate.

She also occupied the ante-chamber of additional collector Ajay More when he was away and put up a board with her name.\n\nKhedkar, who secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 841 in UPSC, even removed all the materials, including chairs, sofas, tables, without the prior consent of the additional collector.\n\nShe then instructed the revenue assistant to provide a letterhead, visiting card, paperweight, nameplate, royal seal, intercom in her name.\n\nKhedkar's father, a retired administrative officer, also reportedly pressured the District Collector's office to fulfil his daughter's demands and warned the officers of repercussions.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washim district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle registration plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seal (emblem)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/ias-pooja-khedkar-104923112-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=BdG6GUpAEPxa2kfzRNrNLTTwU3tTgdGX", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The controversy erupted when Khedkar reportedly requested a VIP number plate and installed a red beacon on her private Audi car. Additionally, she allegedly commandeered the Pune Collector's private chamber, displacing its furniture for her use. Complaints were filed against her by Additional Collector Ajay More, who accused Khedkar of occupying his office space during his absence. Further allegations include Khedkar using a fraudulent disability certificate to gain IAS status and applying undue pressure for various privileges. Her father, a retired IAS officer, is also implicated in exerting influence on district officials. Khedkar, who secured the 821st rank in the 2021 UPSC exams, faces a significant setback as her transfer to Washim unfolds amidst these serious accusations.\n\nVIP Demands Lead to Transfer: Maharashtra's trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar faced significant consequences for demanding VIP treatment, resulting in her transfer from Pune to Washim.\n\nVIP Number Plate and Red Beacon: Allegations state that Khedkar used her influence to request a VIP number plate and even installed a red beacon on her private Audi car.\n\nSeizing Pune Collector's Chamber: Khedkar reportedly commandeered the Pune Collector's private chamber, displacing the furniture and occupying the space for herself.\n\nMisuse of Official Space: During Additional Collector Ajay More's official trip to Mumbai from June 18 to 20, Khedkar allegedly removed furniture from More's adjacent room and occupied it.\n\nCollector's Intervention: Ajay More filed a complaint with Collector Suhas Divas, who subsequently removed Khedkar's belongings from the chamber. Khedkar then allegedly messaged the Collector, stating that such actions would humiliate her.\n\nFraudulent Disability Certificate: Khedkar also faces accusations of obtaining a fake disability certificate to aid her in becoming an IAS officer. She allegedly used this certificate to demand various perks, including a VIP number plate and official staff.\n\nPressure from Family: Reports indicate that Khedkar's father, a retired IAS officer, exerted pressure on the District Collector's office to fulfill his daughter's demands.\n\nUnauthorized Use of Government Symbols: Khedkar is accused of placing the Maharashtra Government board on her private car, misrepresenting her official status.\n\nControversial Appointment: Khedkar passed the UPSC exam in 2021, securing the 821st rank. She filed a petition against the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, arguing that differently-abled candidates face more challenges compared to SC and ST candidates and deserve equal benefits.\n\nMental Health Claims: In her affidavit, Khedkar claimed to be visually impaired and mentally unwell. The 2023 court hearing by Justice MG Shevlikar's bench brought these issues to light, ultimately resulting in her transfer to Washim before completing her training in Pune.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle registration plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawazuddin_Siddiqui", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nawazuddin Siddiqui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Services_Examination_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Services Examination (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Personnel,_Public_Grievances_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/10/1436397-ias-puja-khedkar-970x545.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "dateEnd": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1668}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Image Courtesy: @satyaagrahindia/X\n\nPooja Khedkar, a probationary Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer in Pune, was transferred to Washim in central Maharashtra on Tuesday.\n\nThe development came after a controversy erupted over her alleged misuse of power as a civil servant.\n\nAccording to an official order, Khedkar will complete the remaining term of her training in Washim until July 30, 2025, according to Hindustan Times.\n\nThe alleged misuse of power\n\nIAS officer (2023-batch) Pooja Khedkar hails from a family with a strong administrative background in Ahmednagar.\n\nAccording to Mint, she is the daughter of Dilip Khedkar, who served as Commissioner of the Pollution Department in Maharashtra, and her maternal grandfather, Jagannathrao Budhwant, who had a distinguished career as an IAS officer.\n\nPooja Khedkar was transferred from Pune to Washim after her 'exploits' came to light.\n\nAs per News18, after joining as a probationary officer in Pune, Khedkar allegedly made several demands, including a VIP number plate for an Audi car, placing a red beacon on the vehicle, and a 'Government of Maharashtra' sticker on her private luxury sedan.\n\nApart from these, she repeatedly demanded a separate cabin, residential quarters, letterheads, and additional staff before joining duty as a trainee on June 3.\n\nShe had also been using Pune Additional Collector Ajay More's office while he was away, and had removed his nameplate and furniture, the report said.\n\nHowever, none of these perks are available for junior officers, who are on probation for 24 months.\n\nAccording to NDTV, it was her father who allegedly pushed for her demands to be fulfilled.\n\nThe local authorities, later, formally voiced concerns over her demands to the state Chief Secretary by Pune Collector Suhas Diwase, prompting her transfer from Pune to Washim, where she assumed the role of Assistant Collector to complete her probationary period.\n\n'The 2023 batch IAS officer will serve the remaining period of her probation as Supernumerary Assistant Collector in Washim district,\" the order stated.\n\nFake certificates\n\nKhedkar's appointment in the civil service was initially denied on February 2, 2022, according to Mint.\n\nIn response to this failure, she filed an affidavit in court, asserting that she was visually impaired, mentally ill and of the Other Backward Class (OBC).\n\nShe had reportedly refused six times, to undergo a mandatory medical test to confirm her disabilities, as per News18.\n\nIn April 2022, she was asked to report to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for verification of her disability certificate but she skipped it, citing COVID-19 infection, the official said. Two appointments for the following month and those in July and August were also skipped. In September, she only half-attended a sixth appointment, skipping an MRI test to assess vision loss.\n\nThe Union Public Service Commission, which recruits officers for civil services, subsequently challenged her selection, leading the tribunal to deny her relief.\n\nLast year, she introduced her affidavit under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and was ultimately being appointed, despite scoring a relatively low all-India rank of 841 in the uber-competitive Civil Services Exam.\n\nImmovable assets worth crores\n\nAccording to the Pune Mirror, which cited the statement of assets submitted to the UPSC, the controversial trainee IAS officer possesses immovable assets worth Rs 17 crore.\n\nKhedkar is also accused of adding a non-creamy layer (NCL) certificate despite her father's wealth, which amounts to Rs 40 crore, and her mother, Manorama's, Rs 15 crore.\n\nHer parents' assets includes 900 grammes of gold, diamonds, a gold watch worth 17 lakh rupees, four cars, partnerships in two private limited companies, and one automobile firm, as per India Today. They also possess properties that include shops (1.6 lakh square feet) and seven apartments, including one in Hiranandani, and 110 acres of agricultural land, violating the Agricultural Land Ceiling Act.\n\nAs per News18, she has claimed her annual parental income was Rs 8 lakh.\n\nThe trainee IAS officer herself possesses property worth 17 crore rupees.\n\nGiven her father's wealth, Khedkar's eligibility for OBC non-creamy layer status is under question.\n\nMoreover, a mock interview video featuring Khedkar that has surfaced online shows her mentioning that her parents are separated and that she lives with her mother. But, the claim is in contract with her father's affidavit he submitted while contesting a recent Lok Sabha election from Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi from Nagar South constituency, which doesn't have any such mention.\n\nCriticism\n\nHer activities as a probationary officer and their appropriateness have been the subject of a heated discussion both on social media and in administrative circles.\n\nRTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said Pooja Khedkar became an IAS officer from the OBC non-creamy layer category, but her father's election affidavit showed his wealth to be worth Rs 40 crore.\n\n\"How can such income fall into the non-creamy layer? She has admitted to being mentally ill and a person with multiple disabilities. However, she skipped medical examinations several times. How did she qualify for IAS? These are big questions,\" the activist said, as per India Today.\n\nPMO seeks report\n\nTwo days after her transfer over the alleged misuse of power, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has sought a report on the matter from the Pune collector, according to Hindustan Times sources.\n\nThis comes at the same time when the controversy has further intensified with the Mussoorie-based Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LSBNAA) seeking a report from the state's general administration.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors":

She joined three days after she was transferred from the Pune Collectorate due to an unfavourable report. The report cited her unusual behaviour, inappropriate demands for her position, taking over a senior official's office, and concerns about her OBC-Creamy Layer caste credentials. Khedkar is not only accused of misusing power but also of fudging her disability certificates to get the IAS job.\n\nToday, Pune Police personnel arrived at the residence of the Trainee IAS Officer in Pune. Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar said, \"Pune Police to verify/examine the Audi Car which was being used by Trainee IAS Officer Pooja Khedkar, under Motor Vehicles Act.\"\n\nIn a brief media interaction in Washim, the 31-year-old Puja Khedkar remained composed despite the numerous allegations. She stated that she \"is not permitted to speak on the matter.\"\n\n\"I am very happy to join the Washim district and looking forward to working here,\" she said.\n\nIn her initial media interaction amidst serious allegations of power misuse, trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar stated that she was \"not authorized\" to discuss the matter.\n\nWhen asked about the row surrounding her, she said, \"Government rules do not allow me to speak anything on this matter. So sorry, I cannot speak.\"\n\nIn a letter addressed to the state's top civil servants, including Chief Secretary Sujata Saunik, Pune Collector Dr. Suhas Diwase outlined the allegations against trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar.\n\nThe letter reveals that Ms. Khedkar made several inappropriate demands, such as requesting an official car with a VIP number plate, special accommodation, and an official chamber with adequate staff.

Khedkar, who secured the 841st rank in the UPSC examination, allegedly took the civil services exam claiming both Other Backward Classes (OBC) non-creamy layer status and visual impairment. Reports indicate that she submitted a false certificate claiming visual impairment to gain exemption during the examination and despite multiple calls from UPSC for medical examinations at prestigious institutions like AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, she failed to appear on several occasions, citing reasons including COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, she included a certificate of mental illness among her submitted documents.\n\nMoreover, a viral video purportedly featuring Khedkar has surfaced, where she reportedly claims to live separately from her father. Contrarily, her father Dilip Khedkar, a former officer himself and a recent contestant in the Lok Sabha elections from Maharashtra's Ahmednagar, has not corroborated such statements in his election affidavit.\n\nFurther scrutiny reveals discrepancies regarding Khedkar's categorisation as a non-creamy OBC candidate, despite her father's reported assets worth Rs 40 crore as per his election filing. This incongruity raises questions about the eligibility criteria under which Khedkar applied for and secured her IAS position. When approached for comment, neither Khedkar nor her representatives offered any response on the allegations raised against her.\n\nIAS officer Pooja Khedkar was recently transferred from Pune to Washim district after she allegedly misused her power as a civil servant. Posted as a probationary officer in Pune, she was found availing facilities that are not given to probation officers. She used the red-blue beacon and a board stating 'Maharashtra Government' on her private Audi car. These concerns were formally communicated to the state chief secretary by Pune collector Suhas Diwase, prompting her transfer from Pune to Washim district, where she assumed the role of Assistant Collector to complete her probationary period.\n\nThe district collector, in his report, further said it will be inappropriate to continue Pooja's training in Pune and mentioned this could lead to administrative issues. The report also mentioned that she was offered her own chamber, which she refused to take as there was no attached bathroom. She visited the office with her father Dilip Khedkar.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institutes_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All India Institutes of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safdarjung_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safdarjung Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmednagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washim district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-10-2024-07-2ccc061462a16694b277f1ef11a33aa9-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Khedkar allegedly came under fire for allegedly using a red-blue beacon and VIP number plate on his her private Audi car. She was transferred from the Pune district collector's office to Washim on Monday following complaints of misuse of power. She had allegedly asked for a separate cabin, an accommodation and a car from the Pune district collector even before joining as assistant collector.\n\nThe probationary IAS officer also allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam. She appeared for the civil services exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories and also submitted a mental illness certificate. Khedkar was asked to report at the AIIMS, Delhi for verification of her disability certificate but she did not turn up, citing COVID-19 infection, an official alleged.\n\nSpeaking to reporters amid the serious allegations, she said, \"I'm not authorised to speak anything right now. So I'm not going to comment.\" Asked about his transfer, she said, \"I am very happy to join Washim district and looking forward to working here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a WhatsApp chat between Khedkar and the Pune collector's office which apparently took place before her posting has surfaced on social media. In the chat, she demanded confirmation of her \"seating arrangement and vehicle\".

To this, the unidentified person responded \"Ok. No issue. On Monday we can trace.\"\n\nThe IAS officer then asked the person to share details about her office and a government car. The other person responded, \"Will be discussed with collector sir on Monday\".\n\nOn May 23, she messaged, \"Any update about accommodation, travel, cabin, etc?\" She received no reply. The next day she texted \"Kindly respond. It's important\". \"Good morning... We will check as you arrive,\" she got the response from the other side.\n\nAngered by this, she shot back, \"I think it shld be done before I join not after... I have a lot of things to plan accordingly n cannot leave it to later.\" Four days later she texted, \"Pls get the designated cabin n vehicle done before I join on 3rd. Later there will be no time.

Pune Trainee IAS Officer Transferred Amid 'Audi With Beacon' Controversy - News18", "body": "The controversy surrounds allegations that she utilised her personal Audi car, adorned with a VIP number plate and equipped with red and blue lights, in contravention of official regulations.\n\nPooja Khedkar, a promising 2022 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer from Maharashtra, has found herself in the spotlight amid allegations of exceeding her authority. The controversy centers around accusations that she improperly utilised a personal Audi car equipped with VIP registration and emergency lights, a vehicle marked 'Maharashtra Government,' which has raised eyebrows about its legitimacy under official regulations.\n\nHailing from a family steeped in public service, she clinched the 841st rank in the rigorous UPSC examinations. However, it is also alleged that Khedkar submitted fake certificates to clear her IAS exams. She submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam, said a PTI report.\n\nKhedkar appeared for the civil services exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories, an official reportedly said, adding she also submitted a mental illness certificate. In April 2022, she was asked to report at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi for verification of her disability certificate but she did not do so, citing COVID-19 infection, the official said.\n\nHer father Dilip Khedkar, a former state government officer, while contesting the recent Lok Sabha election, had reportedly declared his property valued at Rs 40 crore. However, Pooja Khedkar appeared for the civil services exam under the OBC category, where the creamy layer certificate limitation is an annual parental income of Rs 8 lakh, said the report.\n\nThe claim came a day after the probationary IAS officer was transferred from Pune to Washim following complaints of misuse of power. After joining as a probationary officer in Pune, Khedkar allegedly made several demands, including a VIP number plate for an Audi car, and placed a red beacon on the vehicle. Local authorities voiced concerns over her purported demands for special privileges which also included separate accommodation and additional staff.\n\nThese concerns were formally communicated to the state Chief Secretary by Pune Collector Suhas Diwase, prompting a transfer for Khedkar from Pune to Washim district, where she assumed the role of Assistant Collector to complete her probationary period.\n\nThe ensuing debate within administrative circles and on social media has revolved around the appropriateness of her actions as a probationary officer. Guidelines typically restrict probationary civil servants from availing certain perks and privileges, adding fuel to the scrutiny surrounding Khedkar's case.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institutes_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Institutes of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washim district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-9-2024-07-45d887679126a5d5360899bb4a7c59f6-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

She will be transferred to the post of supernumerary assistant collector of Washim.\n\nPuja was caught allegedly misusing her power as an assistant collector in Pune. She also used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and a VIP number plate, leading to a controversy.\n\nThe probationary officer had also installed a 'Maharashtra government' board on her private car.\n\nHowever, the issue escalated after she occupied the chamber of additional collector Ajay More while he was away, and put up a board with her name.\n\nShe made changes in the chamber without Ajay's consent by removing his chairs, sofas and tables. She also demanded letterhead, a nameplate, visiting cards, paperweight, royal seal and an intercom in her name.\n\nThe move to transfer her from Pune was taken when Pune district collector Suhas Diwase wrote a letter, dated June 24, 2024, to Maharashtra chief secretary Nitin Kareer stating her misconduct.\n\nAs per the report submitted by Diwse, even before joining duty on June 3, Khedkar repeatedly demanded that she be provided a separate cabin, car, residential quarters and a peon.\n\nThe letter read, \"When I spoke to her, what I realised is that she has a lot of expectations from the administration, just because she is an IAS officer. She is demanding all these things, along with respect, as she feels it is her right. I personally spoke to her and tried to explain to her that she will get all of this once she completes her probation and does her duties diligently.

This controversy has revealed details about her civil services examination attempts, where she claimed to be visually impaired and mentally ill in her affidavit submitted to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).\n\nKhedkar's claimed disabilities granted her special concessions during the UPSC selection process. Despite scoring low marks, these concessions enabled her to pass the exams, securing an All India Rank (AIR) of 841. Following her selection, UPSC mandated medical tests to verify her disabilities. However, Khedkar missed these tests on six occasions.\n\nHer first scheduled medical examination at AIIMS in Delhi on April 22, 2022, was missed, citing Covid-19. She subsequently skipped appointments on May 26 and 27 at AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, and again on July 1. Although she initially agreed to a medical examination on August 26, 2022, she failed to attend the crucial MRI on September 2, which was intended to assess her vision loss.\n\nInstead of attending the tests, Khedkar submitted an MRI report from an external center, which the UPSC rejected. The UPSC then challenged her selection in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled against her on February 23, 2023. Despite this ruling, her MRI certificate was later accepted, confirming her IAS appointment.\n\nAdditionally, inconsistencies were found in Khedkar's claims to OBC non-creamy layer status. RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar revealed that the election affidavit of Dilip Khedkar, Puja Khedkar's father, showed his wealth to be worth Rs 40 crore. Given her father's wealth, Khedkar's eligibility for OBC non-creamy layer status is questionable. Dilip Khedkar had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha polls on a Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi ticket.\n\n\"How can such income fall into the non-creamy layer? She has admitted to being mentally ill and a person with multiple disabilities. However, she skipped medical examinations several times. How did she qualify for IAS? These are big questions,\" Kumbhar stated.\n\nThe details emerged after the Maharashtra government transferred Khedkar from Pune to Washim due to complaints of power misuse. This move followed a letter from Pune Collector Dr. Suhas Diwase to the Chief Secretary. Khedkar will now serve as a supernumerary assistant collector in Washim.\n\nDuring her probation in Pune, Khedkar was found to have made several demands for privileges not permitted to probationary officers. She used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and a VIP number plate, installed a 'Maharashtra government' board on her vehicle, and requested an official car, accommodation, an office chamber, and additional staff.\n\nShe even occupied the ante-chamber of the additional collector in his absence and instructed staff to provide personalized office supplies. Her father, a retired administrative officer, reportedly pressured the District Collector's office to fulfill her demands, threatening consequences if they were not met.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institutes_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All India Institutes of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to Information Act, 2005"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safdarjung_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safdarjung Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/unnamed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "dateEnd": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 850, "textEnd": 863}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 920, "textEnd": 926}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 1043, "textEnd": 1054}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

I am looking forward to working here... I am not authorised to comment on this issue as government rules do not to speak anything on this matter.\"\n\nWashim District Collector Buveneswari S. said that Ms. Khedkar had been allotted the district as a probationary officer.\n\n\"She has commenced work from today. The GAD has a schedule for probationary IAS officers. We are ready to give training to her under that schedule,\" said Ms. Buveneswari.\n\nAs per Mr. Diwase's report, even prior to joining duty on June 3, Ms. Khedkar had repeatedly demanded that she be provided a separate cabin, car, residential quarters and a peon.\n\nShe had also been using Pune Additional Collector Ajay More's office while he was away, and had removed his nameplate and furniture, the report said.\n\nThis was followed by allegations of her having faking disability and furnishing a phoney Other Backward Class (OBC) certificate to clear the civil services exam.\n\nMs. Khedkar has repeatedly skipped her medical examination no less than six times by giving various excuses despite being asked to report at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for verification of her disability certificate.\n\nRTI activist demands probe\n\nMeanwhile, city-based RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar has demanded a thorough probe into the circumstances of Ms. Khedkar's recruitment in the service.\n\nHe alleged that she became an IAS officer from the OBC category where the creamy layer certificate limitation is an annual parental income of \u20b98 lakh while her father's election affidavit showed his wealth to be around \u20b940 crore.\n\nMs. Khedkar's father, Deelip Khedkar, had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha election from the Ahmednagar constituency as a candidate of the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA).\n\nMr. Kumbhar claimed that Ms. Khedkar's parents, despite having a non-creamy layer certificate, possessed property that included 110 acres of agricultural land, no less than seven flats, 900 grams of gold, a gold watch worth \u20b917 lakh and 4 cars.\n\nMr. Kumbhar further alleged that Ms. Khedkar herself possessed property worth \u20b917 crore.\n\n\"The question arises is how can can such income fall into the non-creamy layer category? Furthermore, she has admitted to being mentally ill and a person with multiple disabilities. If someone is mentally ill, how can she be assigned a high post. She has not appeared for the medical at least six times. The GAD has to answer for these irregularities,\" said Mr. Kumbhar.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu, the activist further said that no trainee IAS officer managed to secure a posting in his or her home town.\n\n\"Despite being given Bhandara district as her initial posting, Pooja Khedkar was later given Pune. How did she manage that? This appointment is a blot on a prestigious service like the IAS.

This order comes after the administration received many complaints against her. The government order that was signed by S M Mahadik, assistant secretary, government of Maharashtra, cited administrative reasons for this transfer.\n\nPooja Khedkar, an officer on probation, had been making demands and seeking privileges that were not awarded to a trainee, for the past two months.Some of her demands included- a red-blue beacon light for her vehicle, letter pads, nameplate, separate office chamber and a dedicated staff at her call. Even though Pooja Khedkar was not entitled to these privileges she kept on creating ripples in the administration through her actions.\n\nAlong with this, it is alleged that here father Diliprao Khedkar, a retired officer in Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), had been using his influence to put pressure on senior officials including the collector, additional collector, and resident deputy collector, to fulfill the demands made by her daughter. Pooja Khedkar, had allegedly used red-blue beacon lights on her private vehicle, the picture of which had gone viral and brought this incident to limelight. Further it is speculated that she might have also occupied the ante-chamber of additional district collector Ajay More, without his knowledge.\n\nWho is Pooja Khedkar?\n\nPooja Khedkar is an IAS trainee officer of 2022 batch. She is said to have secured rank 821(Pwd-5) in the UPSC exams. She was posted as assistant collector in Pune but now has been transferred to Washim. Along with her father, Pooja Khedkar's grandfather too was a civil servant. Her mother is an elected sarpanch of Bhalgaon in Pathardi taluka of Ahmednagar district. As an officer on probation, she was expected to work in various departments to gain hands-on experience before her permanent appointment.\n\nShe has been splashed over the internet due to the questionable way of appointment as well as entry into the administrative service. On Feb 2, 2022 Pooja Khedkar was denied appointment, following which she filed an affidavit in court claiming to be visually impaired and mentally ill. The court scheduled her medical examination four times between July and September 2022. She failed to appear all four times and hence the tribunal refused to give her any relief.

The development came three days after she got the marching orders from the Pune Collectorate following an adverse report on her bizarre behaviour, demands not befitting her current status as an IAS-PO, 'grabbing' a senior government servant's office, plus questions raised about her OBC-Creamy Layer caste credentials.\n\nIn a brief interaction with the media in Washim, Pooja Khedkar, 31, appeared unruffled by the barrage of allegations against her and said she \"is not permitted to speak anything\" in the matter. Ranking 841 in the 2023 UPSC list of successful candidates, Khedkar was posted at the Pune Collectorate as a Probationary Assistant Collector in March 2023 for two years -- which itself was billed as an irregularity since an IAS officer's first assignment is usually not in his/her hometown. Pooja Khedkar Transferred: Maharashtra Government Transfers Trainee IAS Officer From Pune to Washim After She Demands Official Car With VIP Number Plate, Uses Beacon Light on Her Private Vehicle\n\nIn the recent past, a Pune RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar made a series of exposes against the 'aristocratic' Pooja Khedkar, her father Dilip K. Khedkar, a retired state government officer, their wealth, alleged questionable documents and reports that they had threatened senior officials with dire consequences if they failed to extend official privileges that were beyond her entitlements.\n\nOstensibly having a penchant for flaunting her status, connections and wealth plus name-dropping, Khedkar zoomed around in her personal high-end Audi A4 on which she had unauthorisedly installed a red-blue flashing beacon light, a 'Maharashtra Government' sticker and got a VIP registration number allegedly with the help of an outside contractor. She demanded -- or helped herself to -- other things that are beyond the reach of IAS-POs, 'taking over' an office of a Resident Deputy Collector in the Pune Collectorate, ordering the revenue assistant to provide her with a letterhead, business cards, name-plate, the Indian insignia, intercoms and other paraphernalia.\n\nAs murmurs and complaints against her mounted, last month the Pune Collector, Suhas Diwase shot off a letter to the Chief Secretary, highlighting all the alleged irregularities perpetrated by Khedkar that finally led to her transfer to Washim on June 8. The RTI activist Kumbhar has cited official records to show that Khedkar's parents with an OBC non-creamy layer certificate, possess huge assets either singly, or jointly in different parts of the state, and her father Dilip K. Khedkar had contested the Lok Sabha 2024 elections as a Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi nominee but trailed in the fourth position. Pune Trainee IAS Officer Puja Khedkar Transferred to Washim Amidst Controversy.\n\nThe family wealth includes 110 acres of land violating the Agricultural Land Ceiling Act, six commercial premises of 1.6 lakhs sq. feet, seven flats including in the post-Hiranandani Complex in Powai (Mumbai), around one kg of gold jewellery, diamonds, multiple bank accounts, a gold watch worth Rs 17 lakh, and a Rado watch worth Rs 60,000, at least three cars of foreign make and one India, partnerships/ownerships in three companies, and Pooja Khedkar has also property allegedly worth Rs 17 crore, according to Kumbhar.\n\nAs the issue snowballed into a major topic of debate on social media, Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar has assured of action against Pooja Khedkar for flouting the laws pertaining to the use of beacon and Maharashtra government insignia on her private vehicle.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Her transfer to Washim follows scrutiny over demands for facilities before assuming office, reportedly influenced by her father, a former administrative officer. Questions also arise about her eligibility for OBC reservations due to her father's assets. The case highlights concerns over ethics and entitlement in civil service, prompting calls for stricter oversight.Puja Khedkar, a probationary IAS officer from the 2023 batch, has begun her tenure at the Washim District Collectorate amidst a backdrop of controversy and allegations. This transition comes after significant scrutiny surrounding her use of privileges and questions regarding her personal assets and status.\n\nPuja Khedkar, a 32-year-old IAS officer, has recently taken on the role of assistant collector at the Washim District Collectorate in Maharashtra. Her arrival follows a period of intense scrutiny and controversy surrounding her conduct and allegations of misused privileges.\n\nKhedkar, who secured an All India Rank of 841 in the UPSC exams, hails from a family dedicated to public service, with her father, Dilip Khedkar, having served as a retired administrative officer. However, her recent actions have thrust her into the spotlight for reasons that have raised eyebrows within bureaucratic circles.\n\nWhat is the controversy\n\nThe controversy surrounding Khedkar erupted when she was observed using a private Audi car equipped with a red-blue beacon and a \"Government of Maharashtra\" sticker in Pune. Even before officially assuming her role as assistant collector, she reportedly sought entitlements typically reserved for senior officials, including an official car with a VIP number plate, accommodations, and exclusive office space. These demands were deemed inappropriate for a probationary officer.\n\nReports also suggested that her father used his influence to pressure the District Collector's office to fulfill these demands. Instances such as allegedly removing a senior officer's nameplate in Pune to occupy office space further fueled criticism against her.\n\nAs a result of these allegations, Pune District Collector Suhas Diwase recommended her transfer to Washim, citing administrative complexities and concerns over her conduct. Khedkar now serves as a supernumerary assistant collector until July 30, 2025, under directives issued by the Pune District Collector.\n\nAllegations on OBC Status and Disabilities\n\nFurther scrutiny focused on Khedkar's OBC status, with discrepancies emerging between her declared assets and the income threshold for OBC non-creamy layer certification. Additionally, questions arose regarding her claims of visual and mental disabilities, which she allegedly did not substantiate despite requests from the UPSC.\n\nPublic and Official Reactions\n\nThe controversy surrounding Khedkar has triggered varied reactions. Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora expressed concern over the potential implications for the integrity of public service, calling for a thorough investigation to uphold transparency and public trust.\n\nWashim District Collector Buveneswari S affirmed Khedkar's appointment for training purposes, emphasizing adherence to protocol during her tenure. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has requested a comprehensive report on the allegations, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.\n\nPuja Khedkar's transition to Washim amid ongoing scrutiny highlights broader issues within bureaucratic governance and ethical standards. As investigations proceed and public scrutiny intensifies, her case serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities and accountability inherent in public office.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washim district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pune district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milind_Deora", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milind Deora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Office_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister's Office (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111665518,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-29490,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Ms Khedkar had also been found using Pune Additional Collector Ajay More's office while he was away. She reportedly removed his nameplate and furniture, and even demanded letterheads.\n\nNone of these perks are available for junior officers, who are on probation for 24 months.

The controversy led to the uncovering of details about her attempts at the civil services exam, revealing that she claimed to be visually impaired and mentally ill in the affidavit submitted to the Union Public Service Commission.\n\nThe disabilities mentioned by Khedkar were used to receive special concessions during her UPSC selection. Despite her low examination marks, these concessions made it possible for her to clear the exams, and she secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 841.\n\nFollowing her selection, the UPSC required her to undergo medical tests to verify her disabilities. However, Khedkar refused to attend these examinations on six different occasions.\n\nHer first scheduled medical examination at AIIMS in Delhi was on April 22, 2022, which she missed, claiming she was Covid positive. Subsequent appointments on May 26 and 27 at AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi were also skipped. She continued to avoid the tests, missing another appointment on July 1. Although she initially agreed to a medical examination on August 26, 2022, she did not show up for the crucial MRI on September 2, meant to assess her vision loss.\n\nInstead of attending these tests, Khedkar submitted an MRI report from an external centre, which the UPSC rejected. The UPSC then challenged her selection in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled against her on February 23, 2023.\n\nDespite this, her MRI certificate was later accepted, confirming her IAS appointment.\n\nApart from the disability claims, inconsistencies were also found in Khedkar's claims to OBC non-creamy layer status.\n\nRTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said that Khedkar's father's election affidavit showed his wealth to be worth Rs 40 crore. Given her father's wealth, Khedkar's eligibility to OBC non-creamy layer status is under question.\n\n\"How can such income fall into the non-creamy layer? She has admitted to being mentally ill and a person with multiple disabilities. However, she skipped medical examinations several times. How did she qualify for IAS? These are big questions,\" the activist said.\n\nThe details of the same have emerged after a controversy arose when the Maharashtra government transferred Khedkar from Pune to Washim due to complaints of power misuse. This move followed a letter from Pune Collector Dr. Suhas Diwase to the Chief Secretary.

She also submitted a mental illness certificate to the UPSC to obtain her IAS posting.\n\nIt was alleged that after her selection, Dr. Khedkar was called by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, for verification of her disability certificate. However, she declined to attend the medical test at AIIMS, citing a COVID-19 infection in April 2022. Despite being called for the test five more times, she continued to refuse, citing various reasons. Later, she allegedly submitted a fake disability verification report from a local private hospital and joined as a probationary officer in Pune. The UPSC challenged her submitted certificate in CAT, but she mysteriously received her joining order, allegedly using political influence.\n\nAfter joining as a probationary officer, Dr. Khedkar reportedly made several demands, including a VIP number plate for an Audi car, allegedly provided by a contractor. According to service rules, officers are not permitted to use private contractor vehicles for government work, but she reportedly used her influence to bypass this regulation. Furthermore, she placed a red beacon on the Audi to emphasize her status as an IAS officer.\n\nSources claim that Dr. Khedkar even took over the Pune collector's private chamber, insisting it belonged to her as an IAS officer. She also demanded a peon and other staffers. This behaviour led to a complaint lodged against her by the state chief secretary. The government then transferred her from Pune to Wasim in Vidarbha. As per the rules, she should not have been posted in her home district of Pune in the first place, but she allegedly used her political connections to secure that posting.\n\nInterestingly, Dr. Khedkar appeared under the OBC category, where the creamy layer certificate limitation is an annual parental income of Rs 8 lakh. However, her father, Dilip Khedkar, who retired as a senior Maharashtra government officer, showed a conservative estimated wealth of Rs 40 crore and an annual income of Rs 49 lakh. In reality, his total asset value is estimated to be over Rs 100 crore.\n\nMr Khedkar also contested the recent Lok Sabha election as a candidate of Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, receiving over 15,000 votes. Both father and daughter were unavailable for comment.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institutes_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Institutes of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Services_Examination_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Services Examination (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Yashwant_Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarbha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vidarbha"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-07%2F7fdbe283-43d1-456a-b230-d262152ba9c0%2FPooja-khedkar-IAS-Pune.avif?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719046", "eventUri": "eng-9719046", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) received her asset statement following a report by the Pune district collector demanding her removal due to belligerent behavior. Her declared assets include several plots of land and properties across Pune. These include a 5.81 and 5.90 guntha plot in Mhalunge, a 724 sq ft plot in Kondhwa, and lands in Dhadvali, Nandur, Pachunde, and Saredi.\n\nKhedkar is accused of several irregularities, including using a siren, VIP number plates, and a \"Government of Maharashtra\" sticker on her private Audi car. She also allegedly used the office of Pune Additional Collector Ajay More in his absence, removed office furniture, and demanded letterheads. These privileges are not typically granted to trainee officers who are under a 24-month probationary period. On Tuesday, she was transferred to Washim after Pune Collector Suhas Divase complained to the Maharashtra government's chief secretary.\n\nPrior to her IAS appointment, Khedkar reportedly earned an annual income of \u20b943 lakh from these properties. Further allegations suggest that Khedkar obtained a non-creamy layer (NCL) certificate, also referred to as the Other Backwards Class (OBC) certificate, despite her parents' substantial wealth. Her father, Dilip Khedkar, a former gazetted officer and Lok Sabha candidate, has declared assets amounting to \u20b940 crore. Additionally, her mother, Manorama's wealth is estimated around \u20b915 crore.\n\nShe was also accused of acquiring the post of an IAS official by providing a bogus medical certificate. She claimed visual and mental impairment to receive concessions in the selection process but refused a mandatory medical test to confirm these disabilities.

In 2022, after she was selected as an IAS officer, the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) called her for a medical checkup. She refused to go citing she had COVID-19 infection.\n\nFrom there on she refused to undergo any medical tests in AIIMS citing different reasons, each time.\n\nAfter she was selected for posting despite receiving an all-India rank of 841, the UPSC highlighted irregularities and challenged it at the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled against her. It is still unclear how her appointment was confirmed.\n\nAccording to TNIE, Khedkar submitted a fake disability certificate acquired from a local private hospital. It has also been alleged that Khedkar received her joining order as a probation officer in Pune allegedly by using political influence.\n\nOnce appointed on probation as an IAS officer, Khedkar started throwing her weight around. She took over the private chamber of Pune's additional collector and demanded extra staff. She used the ambulance red beacon on her private vehicle with a VIP number plate and a 'Government of Maharashtra' sticker for government works.\n\nAccording to the rules, these perks are not allowed for a probation officer. Her irresponsible behaviour led the state chief secretary to complain against her.\n\nKhedkar was transferred to her hometown Wasim in Vadharba, a sharp violation of the rules that probation IAS officers are forbidden to get postings in their hometowns.\n\nThe row has raised questions on how Khedkar cleared the UPSC screening process with her claim for concession as an OBC candidate also being screened.\n\nIt is reported that Khedkar's father Dilip Khedkar is a senior government employee himself and used his connections to secure a seat for her in UPSC.

She did not show up for an MRI exam to evaluate her visual loss, and she just partially attended the sixth exam in September.\n\nThe Commission then disputed her appointment, and a panel decided against her in February 2023.

Her parents contested the recent Lok Sabha polls and all the property details are there in the affidavit,\" he said.\n\n\"Her father, Dilip Khedkar, in his Lok Sabha polls affidavit, showed a conservative estimated wealth of Rs 40 crore and an annual income of Rs 49 lakh. The information is in the public domain. Based on the election affidavit filed by her father in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, the total assets of Khedkar's father amount to Rs 40 crore,\" Kumbhar claimed.\n\n\"This raises the question of how Puja Khedkar could come under the OBC non-creamy layer category. A detailed investigation must be done on how she was appointed as an IAS officer in that category,\" he said.\n\nKumbhar says that Puja Khedkar's IAS application and past need to be investigated so that the truth is revealed.\n\n\"I did some research and it has been revealed in the research that either Puja Khedekar gave a non-creamy layer certificate or her father had been lying in the election affidavit, whatever it is, all these things need to be investigated and the truth must come to the fore,\" Kumbhar claimed.\n\n\"I also have the information that her father owns 110 acres of land in Maharashtra and as per the Agriculture Land Ceiling Act, a person can not keep more than 54 acres of land here. This also needs to be investigated; the culprit must be punished,\" said Kumbhar.\n\nAdding further, he said, \"Even if Puja Khedkar's parents get divorced, it doesn't make any difference because Pooja Khedkar herself has income worth Rs 17 lakh.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Khedekar joined in Washim as a supernumerary assistant collector on Wednesday, when she was questioned about the allegations against her she said that she had officially joined her duty in Washim but service rules prevented her from speaking to the media on the issue.

It is alleged that she had been using a siren, VIP number plates and a \"Government of Maharashtra\" sticker on her privately-owned Audi sedan.\n\nAmid the allegations, she has been transferred to Washim. Responding to the media's queries this morning, Ms Khedkar said she is not authorised to speak on the allegations against her. \"I am very happy to join Washim district and looking forward to working here.\"\n\nPressed further to respond to the allegations, the bureaucrat said, \"Government rules do not allow me to speak anything on this matter. So sorry, I cannot speak,\" she said.\n\nAmong the allegations against her is that she was using Pune Additional Collector Ajay More's office while he was away. She allegedly removed office furniture and also asked for letterheads. Junior IAS officers, who are on probation for two years after they join the service, are not entitled to such perks.\n\nIn a letter to the state's top civil servants, including Chief Secretary Sujata Saunik, Pune collector Dr Suhas Diwase detailed the charges against the trainee IAS officer.\n\nIt has emerged that Ms Khedkar made various unfair demands, the letter states. These included an official car with a VIP number plate, accommodation and an official chamber with adequate staff. According to rules, an officer on probation cannot be provided with these facilities.\n\nReports suggest that her father - a retired administrative officer - allegedly pushed for her demands to be fulfilled.\n\nThe row has also put the spotlight on how Ms Khedkar cleared the UPSC screening process for IAS aspirants -- among the toughest competitive exams in the country. Her claim for concession as an OBC candidate has come under the lens too.\n\nIt has emerged that she claimed to be a visually and mentally impaired candidate to seek concession, but did not undergo a mandatory medical test for confirmation.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggest she skipped the tests five times and half-attended a sixth - she did not appear for an MRI test to assess vision loss.\n\nShe had ranked 841 in the all-India exam -- an unimpressive rank. In fact, the Union Public Service Commission that recruits top civil servants had challenged her selection, and a tribunal ruled against her in February 2023. It is not clear yet how her appointment was confirmed.

Her parents contested the recent Lok Sabha polls and all the property details are there in the affidavit,\" he said.\n\n\"Her father, Dilip Khedkar, in his Lok Sabha polls affidavit, showed a conservative estimated wealth of Rs 40 crore and an annual income of Rs 49 lakh. The information is in the public domain. Based on the election affidavit filed by her father in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, the total assets of Khedkar's father amount to Rs 40 crore,\" Kumbhar claimed.\n\n\"This raises the question of how Puja Khedkar could come under the OBC non-creamy layer category. A detailed investigation must be done on how she was appointed as an IAS officer in that category,\" he said.\n\nKumbhar says that Puja Khedkar's IAS application and past need to be investigated so that the truth is revealed.\n\n\"I did some research and it has been revealed in the research that either Puja Khedekar gave a non-creamy layer certificate or her father had been lying in the election affidavit, whatever it is, all these things need to be investigated and the truth must come to the fore,\" Kumbhar claimed.\n\n\"I also have the information that her father owns 110 acres of land in Maharashtra and as per the Agriculture Land Ceiling Act, a person can not keep more than 54 acres of land here. This also needs to be investigated; the culprit must be punished,\" said Kumbhar.\n\nAdding further, he said, \"Even if Puja Khedkar's parents get divorced, it doesn't make any difference because Pooja Khedkar herself has income worth Rs 17 lakh.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Khedekar joined in Washim as a supernumerary assistant collector on Wednesday, when she was questioned about the allegations against her she said that she had officially joined her duty in Washim but service rules prevented her from speaking to the media on the issue.

Pooja Khedkar, assistant collector, Pune, has pointed out in the documents that she is visually and mentally impaired, to avail selection process concessions. Pooja refused to undergo the mandatory medical examination to confirm her disabilities.\n\nPooja was transferred to Washim after being found guilty of installing a government board on a private luxury car, illegally installing a beacon light and using the additional collector's chamber. The assistant collector traveling in a private car fitted with a beacon light had stoked a controversy. She is a 2023 batch IAS officer.\n\nIt is alleged that she availed many facilities not provided by the government during the probation period. She installed a board 'Govt of Maharashtra' on her private Audi car and installed a red and blue beacon light on top of her car. Apart from this, there is an investigation against Pooja for using the chamber of additional collector Ajay More.\n\nPooja was found using Ajay More's chamber when he was away. She then shifted the office furniture without the permission of the additional collector and demanded an official car with VIP number plate, accommodation, official chamber with adequate staff, a constable and a visiting card.\n\nShe was transferred to Wshim after Pune Collector Suhas Divase complained to the chief secretary. The transfer order was issued after this. Meanwhile, there are reports that her father, a retired IAS officer budged pressure on the collector's office to fulfil her demands.\n\nFake certificate\n\nMeanwhile, allegations of fake certificate were also raised against Pooja. It is alleged that she submitted fake medical and caste certificates to enter service. She wrote the exam stating that she is visually impaired and in the OBC category. It is reported that after the selection, she was called for medical examination, but she failed to appear citing various reasons.\n\nShe was directed to appear at Delhi AIIMS with the certificates for an examination. However, she skipped this due to Covid 19. She was later asked to appear for an examination, she skipped all that for various reasons. She later produced a fake medial verification report from a private hospital.\n\nThe UPSC recruiting officers for civil services, had challenged her selection.

This examination seems like a jackpot to the middle and lower class community who put their tireless efforts to change their fate. You crack this exam of UPSC and you will get everything you wish for - name, fame, respect, prosperity, dignity, and lots of perks. But a recent case of Puja Khedkar who is a trainee IAS officer in Maharashtra cadre, has drawn controversies for not-so-good reasons.\n\nPuja Khedkar has been making headlines for making VVIP demands, but what she has done before to reach this designation is even more shocking. The officer who faced criticism for using a red beacon and a VIP number plate on her personal Audi car actually got selected by misusing a quota that would otherwise have brought some deserving candidate to this post.\n\nKhedkar marked herself as the candidate from the non-creamy OBC to appear for the UPSC exam but her father's election affidavit says otherwise. Her father Deelip Kondiba Khedkar contested from Ahmednagar, Maharashtra for Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi in the Lok Sabha elections 2024. As per his affidavit, he has assets worth Rs. 40 crore.\n\nSo how did the Audi-owning candidate fall in the non-creamy layer of the OBC? Answer best known to the UPSC.\n\nIf this loophole wasn't enough, in her application form and her affidavit submitted to the UPSC, Puja Khedkar mentioned herself as mentally ill and visually impaired. It is due to these concessions that despite fetching low scores, she managed to get the All India Rank (AIR) 841.\n\nAfter her selection, when she was required to undergo a medical examination for verification, all she could afford was a series of postponements. She refused the medical test six times for different reasons, the first one was that she was COVID-positive in April 2022.

Khedkar, who ranked 821 in the UPSC exams, has been relocated following a series of controversies.\n\nAllegations of Misuse of Power\n\nAs an assistant collector in Pune, Khedkar allegedly took advantage of facilities not meant for probationary officers. Reports claim she used a red-blue beacon and a \"Maharashtra Government\" board on her private Audi car. She also allegedly occupied the ante-chamber of Additional Collector Ajay More without permission, removed office furniture without consent, and requested unauthorized facilities.\n\nOfficial Actions and Transfer\n\nPune Collector Suhas Divase wrote to the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra about these issues, leading to Khedkar's transfer to Washim. Here, she will complete her probationary period as a supernumerary assistant collector.\n\nAllegations Involving Khedkar's Father\n\nFurther complicating the situation, Khedkar's father, a retired administrative officer and recent Lok Sabha candidate from the Ahmednagar seat under the Vanchit Aghadi banner, is said to have pressured the District Collector's office to meet his daughter's demands.\n\nRTI Activist Raises Questions\n\nPune RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar raised concerns about Khedkar's eligibility under the OBC non-creamy layer category. Kumbhar pointed out that Khedkar's father declared assets worth Rs 40 crore and an annual income of Rs 49 lakh in his election affidavit. According to Kumbhar, these figures suggest that Khedkar should not qualify for the OBC non-creamy layer status, which is reserved for individuals whose parents earn less than Rs 8 lakh annually.\n\nKumbhar demanded a thorough investigation into Khedkar's IAS application and her past. He argued that either Khedkar misrepresented her status or her father's election affidavit was inaccurate. Kumbhar also mentioned that Khedkar's father owns 110 acres of land, violating the Agriculture Land Ceiling Act, which limits land ownership to 54 acres.\n\nKhedkar's Response\n\nKhedkar joined her new post in Washim as a supernumerary assistant collector on Wednesday. When questioned about the allegations, she stated that she had officially started her duties but could not speak to the media due to service rules.\n\nCall for Investigation\n\nKumbhar insists on a detailed investigation to uncover the truth about Khedkar's eligibility and the claims surrounding her family's assets.

Additionally, the Mussoorie-based Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LSBNAA), which trains civil services candidates, has sought a report from the state government on Khedkar's various lapses that led to her transfer to Washim. The academy's final report will be sent to Union Public Service Commission.\n\nDeputy director of LSBNAA Shailesh Naval has asked the state's general administration to send a report, after the approval of chief secretary Sujata Saunik. According to sources in Mantralaya, Khedkar barged into Saunik's cabin on Wednesday without her permission. A peeved Saunik told HT: \"She came in without seeking time, following which I told her to leave and see the additional chief secretary of general administration Nitin Gadre as I had a busy work schedule.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the third day after her transfer, Puja did not join her duties, said Washim district collector Buveneswari S. \"We have received the state government order, but Khedkar is yet to join her duty. She has neither contacted me nor any administration official,\" said Buveneswari S.\n\nAs photographs of Puja and her Audi with VIP registration number went viral, social media was abuzz with how the medical doctor-turned-third generation civic servant had allegedly misused the system.\n\nPlaying the OBC, PWBD cards\n\nAccording to service allocation list released by the department of personnel and training, Puja got through the IAS with All India Rank 821 under the OBC and PWBD (persons with benchmark disabilities) categories.\n\nInterestingly, while Khedkar applied under the OBC category, which has an income cap of \u20b98 lakh per year for the creamy layer certificate, her father, Dilip, a retired senior officer of the Maharashtra government, declared an annual income of \u20b943 lakh and an estimated wealth of \u20b940 crore in his affidavit for the recent Lok Sabha (LS) elections.\n\nDilip unsuccessfully contested the elections from Ahmednagar as a candidate for Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) garnering over 15,000 votes. Both Puja and her father did not respond to HT's calls or text messages.\n\nIn one of her mock interviews, a video of which was released by a private coaching class academy on social media, the junior officer, when asked about income, claimed that her parents are separated, and she is not in touch with them. However, after joining duty in Pune, Puja's father accompanied her and threatened a senior officer to get her the antechamber.\n\nAfter clearing the UPSC exams, Puja was first asked by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi to appear for a medical examination on April 22, 2022 to ascertain her disabilities and verify the certificate she had submitted. She failed to turn up despite AIIMS calling her six times. She skipped it citing different reasons such as Covid-19 or inability to undergo MRI.\n\nOn September 22, 2022, AIIMS informed the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) that the examination could not be completed on account of Puja's non-cooperation and thereafter on November 14, 2022, AIIMS wrote a letter informing that the petitioner should contact DOPT that her candidature cannot be considered.\n\n\"Despite multiple attempts by the duty officer at AIIMS to contact the applicant (Puja), no response was received from her. Therefore, the percentage of visual disability could not be assessed,\" stated the February 23, 2023, order by Justice MG Sewlikar, judicial member of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).\n\nMeanwhile, documents submitted to CAT and seen by HT, reveal that Puja appeared for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam in 2021 under the OBC and visually impaired categories. Additionally, she claimed mental illness in order to secure her IAS posting despite her All India Rank being low.\n\n\"The IAS probationer who was my client had approached CAT seeking directions to provide reservations for persons with disability for A (visual impairment) and D (mental disability) categories as provided under section 34 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016,\" said Puja's counsel, advocate Vaibhav Kulkarni.\n\nArguing before CAT, Kulkarni stated that his client was suffering from 'claustrophobia' and could not be subjected to MRI. Khedkar had requested the DOPT that instead of MRI, the test may be conducted by another method using the drug vilazodone. CAT however, refused to accept the argument.\n\nPuja then approached the Bombay High Court and got a stay on the CAT order.\n\n\"We challenged the CAT order before HC. The HC bench comprising justices S V Gangapurwala and Sandeep Marje in its April 23, 2023, order gave Khedkar the liberty to appear again before the AIIMS medical board. Her (Puja's) father later told me that she subsequently appeared for the medical examination and got through,\" said advocate Kulkarni.\n\nHer selection process has raised many questions with demands for a probe.\n\n\"It is a surprise how Puja managed to evade every rule right from the OBC quota creamy layer and physical disabilities and yet managed to secure the posting. The UPSC and the government need to probe this matter thoroughly,\" said Vijay Kumbar, state vice-president, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n\nPuja had in 2019 cleared the civil service exam and gotten into the Indian Revenue Service. However, in another old interview, she claimed that she did not get the posting over some technical issues pertaining to the OBC category.\n\nIn 2021, she took the exam once again and additionally opted under PwBD (Persons with Benchmark Disabilities)- Level V category besides OBC quota. The Level V indicates higher disabilities.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Along the way, she\u2019s become a two-time Oscar-winning icon in her own right \u2014 a fate famed Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis seemingly predicted from the very start of her career, when he compared her to none other than the blonde bombshell to rule them all. \u201cDino said I\u2019m going to be the next Marilyn Monroe,\u201d Lange told PEOPLE in a January 1977 cover story around the time of her film debut in De Laurentiis and director John Guillermin\u2019s audacious 1976 remake of King Kong. As Lange recalled recently, back in the mid-'70s, she was working as a waitress in New York City and taking acting classes on the side, when someone suggested she sign up with a modeling agency. She took that advice, and while she says she never actually got any modeling work, De Laurentiis did contact her agency looking for models who were also aspiring actresses. She was sent to Los Angeles for an audition, and ended up landing the role of damsel-in-distress Dwan in the producer\u2019s modern retelling of the classic 1933 monster movie. Lange\u2019s character, of course, was an update of the role played by Fay Wray \u2014 another screen icon into whose shoes she stepped \u2014 in the original, and as Barbara Wilkins noted in the 1977 PEOPLE profile, critics likened Lange \u201cto a smaller Margaux Hemingway, a taller Tuesday Weld, an Eva Marie Saint \u2018under the influence of Spanish fly\u2019 or the next Carole Lombard.\u201d The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! But while Lange went on to play several film and music legends \u2014 and, as she tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue, still hopes to play Marlene Dietrich in a biopic she\u2019s been developing \u2014 early in her career, she bristled at the thought of being likened to Monroe. \u201cThat really upsets me,\u201d she said of De Laurentiis\u2019s comparison in 1977. \u201cShe was a tragic figure who led a tragic life and who wasn\u2019t taken as the serious artist she was. I don\u2019t want to compete with her memory or with anyone.\u201d Nearly 50 years later, Lange says she doesn\u2019t recall that comment. \u201cI don't have that memory of myself,\u201d she told PEOPLE recently, adding that she\u2019d have to revisit the 1977 cover story sometime. She does, however, share other memories of filming King Kong in this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE. \u201cWe shot for nine months and we'd have a lot of downtime,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI spent a great deal of that schedule shooting by myself on a green screen and in a hydraulic giant gorilla hand. And [my costar Charles] Grodin said to me, \u2018This isn\u2019t what movies are like. When you finish this one, just remember there\u2019ll never be another, nothing like this.\u2019 And it was [true]. Maybe it was good that I had no other experience. I just did it because I was naive, and I didn\u2019t know any different, I guess.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. And she\u2019s clearly gotten over her fear of being compared to other influential women. While she\u2019s currently starring on Broadway in Paula Vogel\u2019s Tony-nominated Mother Play, she also recently starred as Broadway legend Lillian Hall in HBO\u2019s The Great Lillian Hall. \u201cEvery era in someone\u2019s life,\u201d Lange says, \u201cit\u2019s important to find what still fascinates you.\u201d Read more with Lange in PEOPLE's latest issue, on newsstands now.", "summary": "After her film debut in 1976&#39;s &#39;King Kong,&#39; producer Dino De Laurentiis called Lange &#34;the next Marilyn Monroe&#34;", "url": "https://people.com/jessica-lange-was-upset-by-1977-comparison-to-marilyn-monroe-8656146", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/V0_Ttl3mIxcs57kH1r9sAZFHzv8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Marilyn-Monroe-and-jessica-lange-1-052924-0154810ce97f4df295a8359b60d8b45e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:05:00", "author": "Dave Quinn,Jack Smart,John Russell", "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "Jack Smart", "John Russell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.305}

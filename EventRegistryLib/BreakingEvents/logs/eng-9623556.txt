He was 67.\n\nLaunching his film career in 1984 with a role in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Anderson was also featured at the same time in the TV series Bay City Blues. TV guest appearances kept him busy for the next years, with roles on The Paper Chase, Tour of Duty, and Quantum Leap, among others.\n\nIn 1990 he landed a recurring role that would become one of his most recognizable: On seven episodes of thirtysomething, he played Billy Sidel, a romantic partner for Polly Draper's Ellyn Warren. After a sometimes rocky path, the two characters were married late in the series.\n\nThe '90s also saw appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (as Commander Kieran MacDuff in the episode, \"Conundrum\"), Melrose Place, Matlock, Sisters, 7th Heaven, Touched By An Angel, NYPD Blue, Jag and, in 1998, as Dr. Edward Porter, father of star Keri Russell's Felicity in the series of that name.\n\nAnderson stayed busy on television well into the 21st Century, with appearances on Major Crimes, Franklin & Bash, and a six-episode run on Bosch, among other shows.\n\nIn her post announcing Anderson's death, wife Trainor wrote that she was \"too bereft\" to write anything extensive, but shared the following statement from brother-in-law Michael O'Malley: \"My brother in law Erich Anderson passed this morning after a brutal struggle with cancer. He had a long successful career as an actor -- he was on that old show 30something; he was Felicity's father on \"Felicity;\" he was killed in a basement in a Friday the 13th movie: he was on Star Trek and dozens of other shows.

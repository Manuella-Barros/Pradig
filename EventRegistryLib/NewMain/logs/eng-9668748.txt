England manager Gareth Southgate now has to ask himself whether he perseveres with a plan at least a year in the making, which has so far yielded next to no signs of encouragement, or throws something else together in the middle of a tournament.\n\nIt is a troubling place to be. The Three Lions were lucky to escape Frankfurt with a 1-1 draw against Denmark on Thursday. Alarmingly for Southgate, they shortened the period in which they were good against Serbia and elongated the bad, spending more than two thirds of this game looking badly disjointed and unable to exert and sort of meaningful control.\n\nAlexander-Arnold is an undeniably talented and versatile footballer. He was not solely to blame for this -- a collective malaise engulfed England almost from the moment Harry Kane gave them an 18th-minute lead -- but Southgate's hope he can provide a fresh dynamic to his midfield looks more misguided with every passing minute.\n\nFor all the individual talent at Southgate's disposal, he is right when asserting England lack a playmaker that has been their undoing in the past: think Italy's Andrea Pirlo in 2012, Croatia's Luka Modric in 2018, Frenkie de Jong in the 2019 Nations League semifinal or Marco Verratti and Jorginho in the last Euros. These are players able to set the tempo of a side, the puppet-masters pulling the strings.\n\nSouthgate admitted on Wednesday that Alexander-Arnold is not that type of player, but \"what I do see is that range of passing and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces\" before adding, \"we know it's a work in progress.\" That last line is some understatement on the evidence of England's opening two matches.\n\nArsenal's Declan Rice has emerged as one of the finest midfielders in Europe, but his best attributes are positioning, winning the ball and, of late, driving forward with purpose. The idea of a double pivot with Alexander-Arnold alongside him is that the Liverpool man's impressive quarterback-style passing range will unlock the best from England's rich array of attacking talent, while his experience as a defender helps advance his understanding of the out-of-possession requirements in that position.\n\nAlexander-Arnold recently claimed he has spent around a year taking advice from Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland about the details of his midfield role. A well-placed source told ESPN that the idea was first floated before the last Euros, for which Alexander-Arnold was sidelined through injury.\n\nAnd as Southgate gathered his thoughts in the Deutsche Bank Park, he admitted that he has been grappling with the problem since taking charge in 2016, given that England's lack of midfield control is a time-honoured tournament failing.\n\n\"We have been trying to find a solution in midfield for seven or eight years,\" Southgate said after the match. \"If we hadn't had Declan Rice for the last few years, I don't know where we'd have been.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Kalvin [Phillips] wasn't a possible for us for this tournament and [Jordan Henderson] the same, so we're trying to find something different. Some of that has worked, some of that hasn't worked so well, but over the years that's been a consistent problem we've tried to find the best way of solving and we've got to do that in the coming weeks as well.\"\n\nThe most damning thing for Southgate is that his grand plan looked thrown together. This was precisely the sort of test it was designed for: Denmark sat with a five-man defence out of possession, resilient and tough to break down, but ended up dictating terms in the middle of the pitch.\n\nPierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg and Morten Hjulmand, who equalised with a brilliant long-range strike on 34 minutes, commanded that area of the pitch with Christian Eriksen flitting in between the lines further forward. Their fluidity negated the argument that a poor pitch cutting up easily could explain England's staccato rhythm.\n\nIt was apt that the goal England conceded came from a misplaced pass and a large gap in midfield with England slow to close Hjulmand down. England laboured in the press and lost possession with alarming regularity.\n\nSouthgate's decision to replace Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher in the 54th minute was a more damning verdict than anything he was every likely to say afterward. Southgate typically waits until after the hour mark to change games; this was only the fifth time in 21 major tournament games that he made the first substitution of the match.\n\nWhat followed was even more surprising as Kane was withdrawn for Ollie Watkins when England needed a goal, part of a triple change that also saw Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen replace Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden. Little improvement followed.\n\nSouthgate held a meeting with the players on Tuesday explaining why there was some negativity mixed into the reaction to England's opening win over Serbia. He may need to stage another one in the coming days given the likely fallout here, a tone set by thousands of England supporters inside the stadium booing the team at full-time.\n\n\"Maybe the biggest thing is we have to accept the environment that we're in and the expectations that are around us,\" Southgate said. \"We are going to have to walk towards that challenge. At the moment we're falling a little bit short of that. Ultimately that's my responsibility. I'm the manager and I've got to guide this group in the best way possible. To achieve extraordinary things, you have to go through some difficult moments. Today was a difficult moment without a doubt, towards the end of the game especially.\n\n\"We have to find the best way to solve that. Of course we need the fans, you know we need the fans, but I have to say they've been brilliant, absolutely brilliant in the stadiums. And I can completely understand their frustration with the way that we played, but what I would say is these boys aren't lacking effort at the moment.\n\n\"But we've got to find a better way of playing, we've got to find more quality in what we're doing. I don't think people would look at them and say, 'They don't care.' If anything at the moment we care too much and we've got to find a way of getting that right balance.\"\n\nEngland are still top of Group C and victory over Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday will secure top spot. Qualification is of course the first thing they can achieve, but the ultimate aim of winning a maiden European Championship still looks a long way off.\n\nOne of Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton must surely come into his thinking against Slovenia. The fact that he is having to consider such a dramatic rethink at all is of considerable concern.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Getty Images\n\nAfter two largely underwhelming displays, the latter of which ended with an ominous ejection nine minutes into the second half, it is perhaps worth remembering why England needed a midfielder like Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first place. Three straight tournaments had ended with the English public wondering what might have been if they'd only been able to wrestle control of the midfield from Luka Modric, Jorginho and Aurelien Tchouameni.\n\nLike manna from heaven, here came Alexander-Arnold. As a right back, Liverpool's No. 66 was more of a wide playmaker, whose greatest strengths were in the final third. He had been an awkward fit for a conservative England side. Then as the 2022-23 season wore on, Jurgen Klopp started inverting his full back more, getting Alexander-Arnold into midfield spots where he could influence play as a deep-lying playmaker. If that was where he was ending up for his club side, why not start him there for his country? What greater upgrade could there be to England's control of games then taking a role previously fulfilled by Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips and handing it to one of the best passers in the sport?\n\nSo far that upgrade is, at best, only apparent in patches. Ironically, Alexander-Arnold's best action of the morose 1-1 draw with Denmark came just before Conor Gallagher replaced him, a customarily searing pass over the top that caught Kasper Schmeichel in no man's land and which Bukayo Saka did well to hook into the side netting. No one in the tournament so far is averaging more accurate long balls per 90 than England's No. 8. In his 54 minutes on the pitch, Alexander-Arnold created more chances and made more line-breaking passes than anyone else.\n\nEngland's misfunctions weren't his alone and his departure hardly presaged an immediate upswing in form. That the Three Lions were so underwhelming is perhaps more down to the fact that their spine -- Harry Kane, Declan Rice and John Stones in particular -- largely looked off-color. The reason that Alexander-Arnold catches the eye is that he promised to be England's ceiling raiser, the man whose guile in the heart of the pitch could take England from tournament contenders into winners. That has not yet transpired.\n\nPerhaps that is simply because it is too late in the day to be teaching Alexander-Arnold how to be a true midfielder, not a right back popping infield as and when required.\n\n\"When you play center midfield, it's like muscle memory,\" says CBS Sports analyst Nigel Reo-Coker, a veteran of seven years of engine room duels in the Premier League. \"You're very aware of danger, when to press, when not to. Your body shape is something you need to understand, your positioning too.\n\n\"When you look at Trent with Rice, the distances sometimes are too tight. He doesn't know when to drop and shield the attacking player, today Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund. When England do have possession he's too square, too in line with Rice. It allows a simple ball between the two of them, between the lines. Whoever you're playing against will break freely and through you. If he's there to offer more crosses, he needs to be higher up the pitch.\n\n\"You can't learn these things overnight. The more you play central midfield, the more you see the danger and understand how your positioning affects the opposition. It didn't work tactically and at times in the game, with Jude Bellingham being free as well, you could put a blanket over Rice, Alexander-Arnold, Saka and even Saka and Kane. They're so tight and narrow in the middle of the pitch. A natural central midfielder would know they can dominate that area and dictate where players can be. They were too flat, too square.\"\n\nPerhaps much of this could have been resolved, or at least mitigated, if Alexander-Arnold had had more reps in the England engine room. Southgate has intimated an interest in moving the Liverpool man infield for some time but injuries have meant that the only teams to line up against a Three Lions midfield including Alexander-Arnold before this tournament were Andorra, Malta, North Macedonia and Bosnia. Those are hardly the sort of teams that can give anyone a sense of how the \"experiment\" will work at the business end of a major tournament, particularly when the subject is not playing alongside Rice and Bellingham.\n\nIn flashes, there are signs of something that might work. One of England's best moments in their opening win over Serbia came when Alexander-Arnold had moved into a pocket of space, offering that angle from Rice such that any pass on the pitch might have been available to him. He picked the right one, a gorgeous ball lofted over the top for Saka to chase down.\n\nSitting in the inside right channel, advanced from Rice, positioning himself in a spot not too dissimilar to that from which Kevin De Bruyne wreaks havoc in a Manchester City shirt, Alexander-Arnold looked primed to deliver a string of precise crosses into the danger area. Was that the best use of his qualities, rather than getting the ball off the England center backs to advance his side up the pitch? Southgate tried some of that approach early on against Denmark but evidently whatever he was trying was not working.\n\nPerhaps the manager himself does not really know exactly what it is he wants from Alexander-Arnold. His post-match comments would suggest as much.\n\n\"He's had some moments where he's delivered what we thought he would,\" said Southgate. \"We know it's an experiment. We know we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Philips. We're trying different things and at the moment we're not flowing as we'd like.\"\n\nWhatever Alexander-Arnold is, he's not a natural replacement for Philips, a mobile destroyer rather than the tempo setter England have been crying out for (while occasionally ignoring the qualities of Michael Carricks and Owen Hargreaveses) throughout their recent international history. It's not entirely clear that that's what Alexander-Arnold is anyway, not when he is only attempting 43 passes against Serbia.\n\nThen again, what else is there? Twice Southgate has turned to Conor Gallagher, a natural midfielder but one whose best performances tend to come in a more off-ball role. Kobbie Mainoo likes to have the ball at his feet but the great quality of his fledgling career seems to be carrying the ball away from pressure that does not always come in the international game. Adam Wharton might offer something England need in possession but even Southgate's most virulent critics might eventually concede that six months of Premier League football is not a lot to go on.\n\nAmid all the tumult, England are where they need to be, top of their group and almost certainly bound for the knockout stages. Reasonably successful tournament runs from this team under this management have included disappointing draws against weaker opposition, particularly Scotland and the USA. On those occasions, however, the sense was of a settled vehicle that just needed a bit of tuning, not one who still hadn't worked out what engine would get it going. The time for experimenting will soon be over and Southgate might not yet have enough information to know whether Alexander-Arnold can be what England need to win Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri":

England manager Gareth Southgate now has to ask himself whether he perseveres with a plan at least a year in the making, which has so far yielded next to no signs of encouragement, or throw something else together in the middle of a tournament.\n\nIt is a troubling place to be. The Three Lions were lucky to escape Frankfurt with a 1-1 draw against Denmark on Thursday. Alarmingly for Southgate, they shortened the period in which they were good against Serbia and elongated the bad, spending more than two thirds of this game looking badly disjointed and unable to exert and sort of meaningful control.\n\nAlexander-Arnold is an undeniably talented and versatile footballer. He was not solely to blame for this -- a collective malaise engulfed England almost from the moment Harry Kane gave them an 18th-minute lead -- but Southgate's hope he can provide a fresh dynamic to his midfield looks more misguided with every passing minute.\n\nFor all the individual talent at Southgate's disposal, he is right when asserting England lack a playmaker that has been their undoing in the past: think Italy's Andrea Pirlo in 2012, Croatia's Luka Modric in 2018, Frenkie de Jong in the 2019 Nations League semifinal or Marco Verratti and Jorginho in the last Euros. These are players able to set the tempo of a side, the puppet-masters pulling the strings.\n\nSouthgate admitted on Wednesday that Alexander-Arnold is not that type of player, but \"what I do see is that range of passing and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces\" before adding, \"we know it's a work in progress.\" That last line is some understatement on the evidence of England's opening two matches.\n\nArsenal's Declan Rice has emerged as one of the finest midfielders in Europe, but his best attributes are positioning, winning the ball and, of late, driving forward with purpose. The idea of a double pivot with Alexander-Arnold alongside him is that the Liverpool man's impressive quarterback-style passing range will unlock the best from England's rich array of attacking talent, while his experience as a defender helps advance his understanding of the out-of-possession requirements in that position.\n\nAlexander-Arnold recently claimed he has spent around a year taking advice from Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland about the details of his midfield role. A well-placed source told ESPN that the idea was first floated before the last Euros, for which Alexander-Arnold was sidelined through injury.\n\nAnd as Southgate gathered his thoughts in the Deutsche Bank Park, he admitted that he has been grappling with the problem since taking charge in 2016, given that England's lack of midfield control is a time-honoured tournament failing.\n\nThe most damning thing for Southgate is that his grand plan looked thrown together. This was precisely the sort of test it was designed for: Denmark sat with a five-man defence out of possession, resilient and tough to break down, but ended up dictating terms in the middle of the pitch.\n\nPierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg and Morten Hjulmand, who equalised with a brilliant long-range strike on 34 minutes, commanded that area of the pitch with Christian Eriksen flitting in between the lines further forward. Their fluidity negated the argument that a poor pitch cutting up easily could explain England's staccato rhythm.\n\nIt was apt that the goal England conceded came from a misplaced pass and a large gap in midfield with England slow to close Hjulmand down. England laboured in the press and lost possession with alarming regularity.\n\nSouthgate's decision to replace Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher in the 54th minute was a more damning verdict than anything he was every likely to say afterward. Southgate typically waits until after the hour mark to change games; this was only the fifth time in 21 major tournament games that he made the first substitution of the match.\n\nWhat followed was even more surprising as Kane was withdrawn for Ollie Watkins when England needed a goal, part of a triple change that also saw Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen replace Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden. Little improvement followed.\n\nSouthgate held a meeting with the players on Tuesday explaining why there was some negativity mixed into the reaction to England's opening win over Serbia. He may need to stage another one in the coming days given the likely fallout here, a tone set by thousands of England supporters inside the stadium booing the team at full-time.\n\nEngland are still top of Group C and victory over Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday will secure top spot. Qualification is of course the first thing they can achieve, but the ultimate aim of winning a maiden European Championship still looks a long way off.\n\nOne of Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton must surely come into his thinking against Slovenia. The fact that he is having to consider such a dramatic rethink at all is of considerable concern.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

At first, his decision seemed to be justified, as captain Harry Kane gave the Three Lions a lead early on. However, England's record goalscorer was at fault for giving the ball away inside his own half, leading to Morten Hjulmand unleashing a strike from distance which beat Jordan Pickford and levelled proceedings.\n\nIn the aftermath of the game, the head coach spoke of one forgotten star who had been unable to find a replacement for.\n\nRelated England 1-1 Denmark: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nEngland were off the boil as Denmark were left unlucky to draw in their Euro 2024 clash.\n\nSouthgate Claims England Haven't Replaced Kalvin Phillips The England boss responded following questions of Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\nIn a post-match interview, Southgate was asked about yet another disjointed England performance. The 53-year-old stated the team were experimenting with different ideas and understood frustration from fans who booed the team off the pitch. He also indicated that the Three Lions were missing Manchester City midfielder Kalvin Phillips. The ex-defender stated:\n\n\"I wanted to get Conor on, we needed some energy and to press better. [Alexander-Arnold] had some moments where he's delivered what we thought he would.\n\n\"We know it's an experiment and we know that we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips. We're trying some different things and at the moment we're not flowing as we'd like, that's for sure.\n\n\"Of course there's a huge amount of work to do. That's evident from the two performances we've given. We have to stay tight. We understand that people will be disappointed with the performances. And rightly so. We've got to make them better.\"\n\nPhillips had been a crucial part of Southgate's Euro 2020 finalists, with the former Leeds United midfielder being dubbed the 'Yorkshire Pirlo' thanks to his fine performances. Lack of game time and injuries following his arrival at the Etihad in 2022 meant that the 28-year-old was a surprise inclusion in the 2022 World Cup squad.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistics: Kalvin Phillips managed just 40 minutes of game time across England's five games at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nUpon his return from the tournament, Phillips' struggles were only exacerbated. The midfielder was criticised for his weight by manager Pep Guardiola and last January he joined West Ham United on loan.\n\nAfter a couple of poor performances, the former international once again found himself on the bench. A permanent departure from the champions is looking likely this summer.\n\nRelated 3 Things Gareth Southgate Got Wrong During Denmark 1-1 England\n\nEngland no longer look like Euro 2024 favourites after another dismal performance against Denmark - and Southgate has questions to answer.\n\nFans React to Southgate's Phillips Comments Many were left baffled by the England manager's claims\n\nThe England manager's statement regarding Phillips at full-time were one of several talking points online. Responses on social media show that fans were shocked by what Southgate had said, with some going as far as calling for the former Middlesbrough manager to get the sack.\n\nThe Three Lions head coach persisted with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield, although the Liverpool star was withdrawn after just 53 minutes.

Southgate had selected the same starting line-up as in Sunday's narrow 1-0 win against Serbia, a performance which drew concern from fans but still resulted in three points.\n\nMidfield is the starting point for where supporters are demanding change, particularly in the case of Trent Alexander-Arnold. The Liverpool right-back has struggled so far in a central midfield role, an experiment which many fans hope is brought to an end when the Three Lions take on Slovenia in their final Group C game on Tuesday.\n\nThe same goes for deploying Phil Foden on the left wing, with most supporters desperate to see him play centrally. On a tactical note, fans are unhappy with how England have approached their two opening games after taking an early lead - a criticism of Southgate's era prior to Euro 2024.\n\n\"The whole root of the problem is trying to accommodate Trent Alexander-Arnold,\" one fan argued. \"Stop putting round pegs in square holes and play [Anthony] Gordon on the left and Foden centrally and drop Trent who ISN'T a midfielder.\"\n\nWhen Alexander-Arnold was subbed off for team-mate Conor Gallagher in the 54th minute, one supporter's reaction read: \"That has to end this ridiculous Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield experiment, absolutely f****** invisible.\"\n\n\"I'd start Cole Palmer over Phil Foden and Kobbie Mainoo over Trent Alexander-Arnold in the next match,\" another fan stated on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nA second would even drop Jude Bellingham, saying: \"Cole Palmer should start next game for England, Foden should sit on bench, Gallagher to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold and [Ollie] Watkins should replace [Jude] Bellingham.\"\n\nEx-England striker Daniel Sturridge also weighed in, adding: \"England are too talented to sit back after scoring, we got away with it last game but paid for it this game. Our best defense is to attack.\"\n\nYour turn! How should England line up against Slovenia? Join the debate in the comments section\n\nThe Kane debate is in full flow, too, with England's captain and all-time top goalscorer being ruthlessly hooked on 69 minutes, a decision which showed how dissatisfied Southgate was with his all-round display against the Danes. \"I want to see Ollie Watkins in place of Harry Kane in the next match against Slovenia,\" one fan declared. \"But Southgate will not take bold call.\"\n\nAnother followed up by saying: \"Harry Kane has always been the most important player for England but he should drop this 'false nine' thing or have Watkins starting. He keeps occupying the same space as the no. 10.\"\n\nA deflated Kane even suggested post-match that England are getting their tactics wrong under Southgate, admitting to BBC Sport: \"I think we're struggling both with and without the ball. I think the pressure in both games hasn't been right and with the ball hasn't been good enough.\n\n\"Everyone's dropping below their levels a little bit. It was tough out there, but we're calm. It wasn't our greatest game but we got away with a point.\"\n\nAs for Southgate's verdict, he confessed: \"There's a huge amount of work, that's evident from the two performances we've given and we've got to be tight. We understand people will be disappointed with the performances and rightly so and we've got to make them better.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Chelsea midfielder, though, has flaws of his own, including a tendency to be careless in possession, and it is odd that Southgate picked Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, a player who loves to take care of the ball, if he is not going to use him in Germany.\n\nSouthgate believes Alexander-Arnold can unlock packed defences with his brilliant range of passing and there were glimpses of what he can offer offensively.\n\nHis last contribution before being replaced was a raking ball over Denmark's defence towards Bukayo Saka, which the Arsenal winger did well to head into the side-netting.\n\nThese moments of class from Alexander-Arnold on the ball do not compensate for his struggles without it, particularly as he could just as easily play spectacular passes from right-back.\n\nEngland lacked control and defensive solidity in the middle of the park, and better sides than Denmark will ruthlessly exploit such weaknesses in the knockouts.\n\nFour points from their opening two games means England have effectively booked their place in the last-16 at Euro 2024 but there is still the group to be won, which will likely leave Southgate reluctant to make wholesale changes for Tuesday's meeting with Slovenia in Cologne.\n\nHe must, though, surely consider a new partner for Rice in midfield, with Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo the other option available.\n\nThere is no perfect solution and limited time to bed-in a new player and system. Suddenly, there is a case that gambling on Alexander-Arnold working in midfield at a major tournament was foolhardy, a risk that has now backfired.\n\nIf there was a major positive for Southgate, it was in the display of Foden, who was far more involved than against Serbia, popping in pockets outside the box and looking dangerous.\n\nHe showed a glimpse of his Manchester City form by turning away from an opponent early on and bursting into the box, only to slice a shot wide, and his effort of the post was nearly a narrative-shifting moment at these Euros.\n\nSouthgate - who replaced Foden, Saka and Kane with Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins with 20 minutes to play, largely without effect - will also take heart in the result itself, which leaves England unbeaten and definitively preparing for another week in Germany.\n\nThere is still time to grow into these finals and, at this stage, perhaps Southgate is right that the scrutiny on certain payers and performances is overblown.\n\nThat said, the manager is now under pressure to recalibrate his midfield, and ensure this game goes down as a forgettable off-day, akin to the draws with Scotland and the USA in the second game of the last two major tournaments.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Having been given a second chance to help dominate the midfield, he was unable to gain the upper hand on the tenacious Danes and drifted out of the game.\n\nIt was no surprise when he was substituted out on 54 minutes and replaced by Conor Gallagher, so out of sorts did he seem with little of the spark in his play that makes him such a star for Liverpool.\n\nTournament football is not the time for experimentation, and Southgate must now decide if this switch is over or whether he will persevere in England's final group game against Slovenia on Tuesday.\n\nHis side are on the brink of a place in the round of 16, and that will be foremost in Southgate's mind.

In as much as there is any agreement on anything concerning the England team, Gareth Southgate may have thought he had given the people what they wanted. He had crammed in his four most gifted attackers and a generational talent of a passer, primed to supply them.\n\nAnd in Trent Alexander-Arnold's parting contribution, he almost got a glimpse of what might have been.\n\nSouthgate thinks Alexander-Arnold is a quarterback of a midfielder. And if an up-and-under seemed borrowed from rugby rather than American football, it resulted in Bukayo Saka heading into the side netting. But by then, the decision had been made. A minute later, Alexander-Arnold was withdrawn, Conor Gallagher introduced in the 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nSouthgate experimented with an artist in his midfield and ended up with a loyal labrador. Gallagher cannot do what Alexander-Arnold can on the ball. But the Liverpool right-back cannot do what the Chelsea runner does without it. Gallagher hustles and harries. At times, he doesn't do much else. He was booked within a few minutes for ploughing into Andreas Christensen. English football has a historic love of conspicuous effort and, very obviously, Gallagher is a player who tries.\n\nEnglish football also has a host of historic weaknesses. Not knowing what to do with the unconventional is one.\n\nAlexander-Arnold is not a maverick in personality, not a loose cannon, but his skillset is unique. Another is a traditional failing midfield: gifted as the individuals sometimes are, England can look less cohesive than many an elite opponent. Alexander-Arnold was in a position where England needed him to knit the team together. Instead, it was disjointed, England less than the sum of their considerable parts.\n\nIt was not all his fault. Yet the nature of tournament football is that experiments sometimes have to be aborted. The side that starts the group stage does not necessarily end the knockout stages. Even on a day when Southgate substituted his whole front three, Alexander-Arnold looks the most fallible.\n\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool long excelled at playing to his strengths. Denmark exposed a novice midfielder's weaknesses. Or perhaps England did.\n\nChristian Eriksen apart, Denmark's is not a particularly technical team. Yet there was an assurance, an understanding, a capacity to head for pockets of space. England were outmanoeuvred; not by the Danes' front two but by the trio behind them. By half-time, Denmark's three central midfielders had attempted two shots apiece; the first, from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, came after barely 20 seconds. It could be seen as a warning shot: when Morten Hjulmand levelled, no one tried to close him down until Saka made a belated effort.\n\nAnd part of the difficulty for a newcomer to midfield like Alexander-Arnold is the positioning, part the pressing. It is a question of timing, of teamwork; of managerial strategy too.\n\nEngland rarely lack effort but more garlanded managers than Southgate, such as the Serie A winners Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, have seen their sides look outwitted and outclassed in midfield. It has been a theme of English football over the years, one that long predates the Southgate reign.\n\nMesut Ozil destroyed England in the 2010 World Cup, Gareth Barry panting in desperate pursuit. Andrea Pirlo conducted a personal waltz away from them in 2012 and then 2014; first as a regista, then in a more advanced role. Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Marcelo Brozovic decide not to give Southgate's side the ball in the 2018 World Cup semi-final. Jorginho and Marco Verratti elegantly wrested control of the Euro 2020 final away from them.\n\nAs England floundered in Frankfurt, Southgate may have been pining for two he had to cull from his plans, unflashy favourites who could protect a defence, paragons of past tournaments. First Kalvin Phillips made himself unselectable. Then Jordan Henderson did, more on grounds of fitness. If Southgate could pluck a player from England's past to put in the current team, it might not be the 1966 Bobby Charlton - this side are scarcely short of attacking talent - as much as the 2018 version of Henderson or Phillips in his 2021 form.\n\nOr maybe the 2006 Owen Hargreaves or the Paul Ince of 1996; someone, at any rate, to sit alongside Declan Rice, complement him and add solidity. Even with Gallagher om, England looked too open. They kept letting Hojbjerg shoot.\n\nThis was why Southgate kept ignoring the evidence, kept picking Henderson when he was playing in Saudi Arabia and Phillips when he wasn't playing in England.\n\nHe wanted another workmanlike midfielder to bring a dose of dullness, to help the defenders defend and let the attackers attack.\n\nInstead he turned to Alexander-Arnold. And now, while the rookies remain in reserve, in Adam Wharton and Kobbie Mainoo, he may replace him with Gallagher. And the instruction video may not be a compendium of Alexander-Arnold's greatest passes but a compilation of Phillips and Henderson closing players down.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

It now remains to be seen whether Southgate sticks with the Liverpool defender after Chelsea 's Conor Gallagher added some energy to the Three Lions team after replacing Alexander-Arnold.\n\nSouthgate said: \"We have been trying to find a solution in midfield for seven or eight years. If we hadn't had Declan Rice, I don't know where we'd have been.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Kalvin (Phillips) wasn't a possible for us for this tournament and Hendo ( Jordan Henderson ) the same, so we're trying to find something different.\n\n\"Some of that has worked, some of that hasn't worked so well - but over the years that's been a consistent problem we've tried to find the best way of solving and we've got to do that in the coming weeks as well.\n\n\"One of our biggest problems was we weren't pressing well enough as a team, so Trent had all sorts of problems to solve without the ball - and most of the time he did really, really well.\n\n\"But clearly you're going to see different pictures when you're in there every week. He's had moments where he's played the passes that we thought he could. I understand, you're always going to ask me about individuals, but the team didn't function today. That's my responsibility.\"\n\nSkipper Harry Kane was also substituted by Southgate for the first time in two-and-a-half years - despite becoming England's record tournament goalscorer with a close-range strike that put England ahead in the 18th minute. His strike-partners Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka were replaced at the same time.\n\nAsked whether Kane is still struggling for fitness after suffering a back injury late in the season with Bayern Munich, the England boss said: \"We just felt that our frontline put a lot of work into the game the other day (against Serbia). Harry has only had one 90 minutes in the last five or six weeks, so the other night took a lot out of him.\n\n\"We could have stayed with it, but we thought to get speed in the frontline at that moment, to get energy to be able to press was important. So, that was the decision we took with all of the substitutes basically.\n\n\"We played more with a 10 today and that meant that when Kane was coming low, we had players running past him and having a little bit more contact with him. We also pressed slightly differently, which meant that Foden was starting a little bit more in-field.\n\n\"But our press wasn't intense enough and it meant that our backline had a problem with the players dropping either side of our pivots. That's something that has to be better. We know with the profile of players that we've got, we don't feel the way to press is really high up the pitch.\n\n\"I don't think that's the physical level of the team at the moment. But we've got to find a way of being more compact and more difficult to play against.\"\n\nSouthgate accepts that he has an issue with the balance of his team. Foden appears unsure of the role he is being asked to play on the left after the England manager opted to use Jude Bellingham as a No.10 and Saka on the right.\n\nAnd Luke Shaw's continuing absence means Kieran Trippier is operating out of position at left-back. Southgate said: \"It's clear in terms of the balance of the team that we don't have our best left-back available, so that denies you the opportunity for that balance.\n\n\"Tripps has done an incredible job for the team. His spirit, his organisation, his desire have helped us get over the line in the last two games.

Centre backs need to be screaming at them to get out to enable them to push out.'\n\nJamie Carragher criticised England midfielder Delcan Rice for being too deep in midfield\n\nCarragher also felt that Trent Alexander-Arnold was sitting too deep against Denmark\n\nCarragher called for England's centre-backs to tell the midfielders to move up the pitch\n\nThere had been much debate prior to the tournament about the decision to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield considering that he usually plays at right-back for Liverpool.\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate elected to start Alexander-Arnold in midfield for the first two group games but he does have other potential options such as Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton.\n\nGareth Southgate elected to start Alexander-Arnold in both of England's first two group games\n\nIt will be intriguing to see whether Alexander-Arnold will be able to retain his place in the starting lineup throughout England's involvement in the tournament.\n\nRice is one of the most experienced players in the England squad with regards to international caps having represented his country on over 50 occasions.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, meanwhile, has had to be more patient for chances but is now a key player for Southgate's side.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Grains_and_Legumes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Grains and Legumes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668748", "eventUri": "eng-9668748", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

England had just drawn 1-1 with Denmark and become the first team at these Euros to be booed off by their own supporters.\n\nThe England crowd were angry because they had just watched a performance of bone-jarring ineptitude which makes it very difficult to be optimistic about their prospects. The pattern of the game had followed a familiar pattern: England scoring first, then forgetting how to play football. It was the story of their World Cup semi-final against Croatia and their Euros final against Italy. After nearly eight years, shouldn't Gareth Southgate have developed some ideas for how to respond in these situations?\n\nVictor Kristiansen's dozy mistake after 18 minutes let Walker in to set up Harry Kane for what should have been a nerve-settling goal. Instead it was Denmark who took control, equalising through Morten Hjulmand's screamer on 32 minutes and dominating England throughout much of the rest of the game.\n\nIt was not entirely surprising to see this happen, after the way England had played against Serbia. England's win there had disguised a pretty poor performance: Kane was hardly involved, Phil Foden was a shadow of his Manchester City self, the midfield combination of Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold was directionless and the team looked entirely paralysed down the left side, where Kieran Trippier offered absolutely nothing from left-back.\n\nSouthgate had gone with the same team he picked for the Serbia game, despite some calls for Alexander-Arnold to be dropped. That decision seemed to be saying: \"I have the courage of my convictions. I believe Alexander-Arnold offers something important to the structure of this team. I believe this is worth persisting with.\"\n\nThe early substitution showed that Southgate didn't really have any such conviction. He didn't really know why he wanted Alexander-Arnold in there, nor did he understand why it hadn't worked the first time. The decision to keep him in the team was not far-sighted and wise, it was just an attempt to look that way. It was a bluff.\n\nAlexander-Arnold's last contribution was a lofted ball that Bukayo Saka initially struggled to control, then headed over Kasper Schmeichel and wide. It was his third key pass of the game, more than any other England player managed over 90 minutes.\n\nIs it more humiliating to be substituted at half-time or to be hooked eight minutes into the second half? The first is pretty bad, but the second is basically the same, with the added suggestion that you've ignored whatever instructions you were given at half-time.\n\n[ How can England play this bad with players this good? ]\n\n\"Trent isn't a midfielder\" screamed a million internet I-told-you-sos. To which you find yourself wondering - \"and Conor Gallagher is?\"\n\nAlexander-Arnold's unusual style and history of playing most of his career at right-back makes him a lightning rod for the anxiety watching this team makes the English feel.\n\nGallagher seems a safer bet to many people if only because he doesn't have a history of playing at right-back. The question: now that Alexander-Arnold had picked up the initial tab for this terrible performance, would his replacement with a much less gifted footballer make England play any better?\n\nThe answer turned out to be no. It wasn't Gallagher's fault, of course. Not many players would manage to look good sent out into a shapeless, malfunctioning team armed with nothing more than some vague instructions to show some energy and get stuck in. Gallagher did at least do that - he was booked after eight minutes on the pitch and was lucky not to be sent off after 13.\n\nAlongside him in midfield, Rice was producing the worst half he has played all season - as though he had heard that James McClean has been saying he's overrated on RT\u00c9, and McClean had somehow, against all odds, got into his head. One can only imagine McClean's delight during that second half as Rice repeatedly fell over, ran into opponents, lost the ball with heavy touches, or clubbed mishit passes out of play.\n\nDesperate to do something to change the pattern of the game, Southgate made his second major intervention. He replaced his entire front three - off went Kane, Foden and Saka, on came Watkins, Eze and Bowen. This is the coaching equivalent of \"have you tried switching it off and switching it back on again?\" It was not the sort of call that will inspire confidence in Southgate's insight among either the players or supporters. Needless to say, it didn't work.\n\nMeanwhile Trippier, maybe the most nonexistent player of these Euros, completed another 90 minutes at left-back. England's problematic left side is casting Southgate's pre-tournament decisions in a pretty harsh light. Say what you like about the seasons Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford have just had, but both are highly experienced players who usually play on the left. Southgate left them both out in favour of players like Cole Palmer (a number 10), Eberechi Eze (another 10), Jarrod Bowen (a right-winger) and Ivan Toney (a non-playing 9).\n\nOn the positive side, England have four points and will be in the second round. If they stay as lucky as they were today, they have a great chance of going all the way.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

I don't think Gareth Southgate does panic but it is time for him to interfere and find solutions and change something because of three things we've seen in these first two games.\n\n\"We let them off [on Sunday] because it was the first game of the tournament, but when you see it for a second time, it becomes a pattern, and a pattern needs disrupting if it is negative.\n\n\"There's an imbalance in the team, square pegs in round holes. Because of that you start to drop deep as a protective measure because you feel like you are not comfortable.\n\n\"Then the third thing occurs, which has happened to England over the years, and you can't play out through midfield and play out from the back. You end up giving the ball away and we look like a mess.\n\n\"I and we know how this ends. He has to change something now.\"\n\nNeville questioned whether the attacking quality at Gareth Southgate's disposal had, conversely, ended up limiting him and left him to shoehorn in players at the expense of England's balance.\n\n\"It's the first time I've felt like Gareth is slightly conflicted with this embarrassment of riches,\" he added. \"It's the first time where you're asking questions - how do you get Trent, Foden, Palmer and Bellingham into the team, and that's causing him more problems than providing answers.\n\n\"That shouldn't be the case, he has to look really closely in the next 24 hours, maybe let the players have a conversation with themselves as well, because we've talked about their spirit and accountability, but they're not playing particularly well and need to sort themselves out.\n\n\"But from Gareth's point of view, he needs to get on the training ground in a couple of days' time and give them the answer moving forward. This ends badly the way in which it's going.\"\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's foray into England's midfield was once again under the spotlight, with the Liverpool man struggling in the position once again.\n\nSky Sports pundit Roy Keane called the decision from Southgate a \"gamble\" and argued Alexander-Arnold is not up to the task in midfield.\n\n\"When you've been taken off in the two games it is not a good sign,\" Keane told ITV Sport. \"I always thought it was a huge gamble to play a player who doesn't play there week in, week out for his club.\n\n\"Midfield is a tough position physically and getting your distances. He's come up short in both games.\n\n\"It's not all down to him. You'd have to probably put this on Gareth. It's a huge gamble to throw a full-back into the middle of the park, and this is not against France, Germany or Spain which could be tougher tests ahead for England.\n\n\"This is against two teams that we thought England would be fairly comfortable against and have lots of possession.\n\n\"It was a big ask for Alexander-Arnold, and he's not up to it.\"\n\nWhen England manager Gareth Southgate was asked about Alexander-Arnold by BBC Sport, he said: \"Trent has had some moments where he's delivered what we thought he would.\n\n\"It's an experiment, we know we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips but we're trying some different things - and at the moment we're not flowing as we'd like.\"\n\nNeville also singled out the poor performance of Declan Rice and questioned whether the Arsenal man was playing in his right position as the deepest of England's midfielders.\n\nHe pointed to Gunners boss Mikel Arteta's decision to move Rice further forward in the final months of the domestic season and said Kobbie Mainoo or Adam Wharton may be the best solutions to operate in the holding role for the Three Lions.\n\n\"Mikel Arteta moved Declan Rice out of that position for the last 15 games of the season to bring Jorginho and Thomas Partey in because he's not that good at playing in there,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the most nervous I've seen Rice and he's a brilliant player. He's better moving up the pitch.\n\n\"If you think about Toni Kroos and Rodri, these players that get the team playing. At Manchester United, it was Roy Keane and Paul Scholes. It's Jorginho for Arsenal. Every team that is great has this type of player and we don't seem to have that player.\n\n\"Kobbie Mainoo might be the one. There's Adam Wharton who can do it. We have to resolve that problem and I'm not just talking about Gareth in this next four days, but I'm talking about England generally.\n\n\"We've never been able to get out from the back properly in moments of pressure.\n\n\"When Rice goes to receive the ball deep with his back to the play, I think he's quite basic. I don't think he's as good as the other players who play that position.\n\n\"Where I think he's brilliant is when he's marauding forward, he's running onto the game, he's up on top of the game and he's being aggressive.\n\n\"If you look at his touch map for Arsenal in the last part of the season, most of his touches are in that high left channel.\n\n\"I get that he's got Jorgihno, Partey and full-backs pushing into midfield, but England haven't got that balance in midfield.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, that certainly was not the case.\n\nOutside of a Harry Kane goal on the back of a Danish mistake and a long range effort from Phil Foden, they failed to create many chances of note.\n\nDenmark were the better side for the vast majority of the game, controlling the midfield and putting England under quite a bit of pressure. They would be unable to find the winner, although there was no doubt they were more deserving of a victory.\n\nIn the end, England managed to hold on for a 1-1 draw.\n\nREAD HERE: Former Aston Villa Boss Recalls His Lucky Paul McGrath Celtic Escape\n\nLooking at the talent in the England squad, it is baffling to see them perform in this manner. They lack any sort of threat in attack, but their midfield is arguably an even bigger concern.\n\nThe trio of Declan Rice, Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Jude Bellingham are struggling to perform as a unit, with all three well off it in this game.\n\nAlexander-Arnold was withdrawn a few minutes into the second half, with his inclusion in the midfield a bit point of contention at the minute. Many feel that his lack of experience in that position is something is costing his team.\n\nSpeaking on ITV, Roy Keane said that the Liverpool player had been 'found out' as a midfielder so far during Euro 2024.\n\nWhen you've been taken off in the two games, that's not a good sign. I thought it was always a huge gamble when you play a player who doesn't play that (position) week in, week out for his club.\n\nI know people say he drifts in there for Liverpool, but drifting into a position and starting there is completely different. I've played in midfield, it's a tough position physically, getting your distances. He has come up short in the two games.\n\nIt's not all down to him, you'd have to put this probably on Gareth [Southgate]. It's a huge gamble to throw a fullback in the middle of the park.\n\nThis is not against the French or the Spanish, obviously they've got tougher tests ahead against the them or Germany. This was against two teams where you'd expect England would be fairly comfortable and have a lot of possession.\n\nIt's a big ask for him and he's not up to it...\n\nWhen you talk about what you do in possession, it's really important against the better teams what you do out of possession. That's why he has been thrown in at the deep end. Okay he's going to be comfortable on the ball, if you give him time he can see a pass, there's no doubting that.\n\nBut it's the other bits of his game. Even for [Declan] Rice, Rice feels like he's almost babysitting him out there. You can't do that at this level, you will be found out and he has been.\n\nConsidering the team's struggles in midfield, it would not be a surprise to see Trent Alexander-Arnold take out of the team for the Slovenia game. However, it is clear that he is far from the only issue in that England team at the moment.\n\nOutside of Marc Guehi and one game from Jude Bellingham, there have been very few good performances within their squad at the minute.\n\nThey may have been viewed as favourites to win Euro 2024 by the English media, but they have done nothing to justify that tag up to this point in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGrath_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul McGrath (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNlxcXC8yMDE5NDU1NVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNi0yMFQxOTQ1NDEuODk1LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIwMDYzMjI5OGYwYTE5OWQzMzk2YWM1NjQ4ZjkzMmE5ZDkyMmMzNjUxIn0=/roykeanesaysenglandstarhasbeenfoundoutafterdenmarkdrawballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668748", "eventUri": "eng-9668748", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

No-one grows up and wants to be a Gary Neville!\"\n\nIt was September 2013 when Carragher said it, just months after retiring. While he was playing at full-back when Liverpool won the treble in 2001, under Rafa Benitez he went on to establish himself in his favoured centre-back role and become one of Reds' greatest defenders of the Premier League era.\n\nIn contrast, as Carragher pointed out, Neville started his Manchester United career as a centre-back before 'failing' and being pushed to right-back. Sir Alex Ferguson would later tease how the Red Devils legend hadn't been tall enough to play centrally.\n\nWhile Neville was the butt of such jokes, he has now made a similar point himself when writing off Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold ability to play in midfield.\n\nIn truth, since Carragher's 2013 quip both Alexander-Arnold and Reds team-mate Andy Robertson have re-written the rule book when it comes to how full-backs are perceived.\n\nBoasting 30 goals and 144 assists between them during their Anfield careers, winning every major honour along the way, they have ensured that the position is no longer as unglamorous as it once was.\n\nYet Liverpool have spent the last 18 months utilising Alexander-Arnold as an inverted full-back in an attempt to get him on the ball in the middle of the park, along with occasionally fielding him purely in midfield.\n\nWith incoming Reds head coach Arne Slot having previously played with an inverted full-back and double pivot midfield at Feyenoord, it will be curious to see how he intends to use the Liverpool vice-captain. Yet such a quandary is for another day, with the 25-year-old's utilisation for England during Euro 2024 an ongoing talking point.\n\nRegarded as predominantly a midfielder by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate over the past year, Alexander-Arnold started in the engine-room in England's opening victory over Serbia and retained the berth against Denmark, following 12 months of hard work behind the scenes.\n\n\"I felt prepared through the conversations and the work we've done throughout the week,\" he said about the win over Serbia. \"It may seem brand new, but it's not.\n\n\"Me, the manager and Steve Holland, we've been working very hard on this role for the past year so a lot of preparation has gone into it, a lot of information, learning and a lot of analysing has gone into it.\"\n\nAlexander-Arnold's display has resulted in plenty of scrutiny and debate, with an ever-growing list of pundits weighing in on the 25-year-old's position. Unsurprisingly, they are not in universal agreement.\n\nNeville is one of the leading voices disputing Alexander-Arnold's utilisation as a midfielder - in disagreement with Carragher.\n\nAnd he recently channelled the Reds legend's put down, claiming if Alexander-Arnold was good enough to be a midfielder then he wouldn't have spent most of his career at right-back.\n\n\"What Jurgen Klopp's done at Liverpool is find a way to get him into midfield from right back,\" Neville said on ITV. \"Look there's no doubt if you're good enough to play in midfield all the time, you would play in midfield.\n\n\"The reason you were right back is because basically you've been shoved back there from being either a wide player or a midfield player at some point in your life and you've not been good enough.\n\n\"I was the same as the 14-year-old or 15-year-old, I was a midfield player, we all were and then we got pushed back.\n\n\"So where you saw Trent struggle a couple of times there was when it was tight and with his back to play. To receive the ball with back to play is the hardest thing in football in midfield.\n\n\"We don't do it well as full-backs, not even Trent, who's unbelievable on the ball. He's uncomfortable in that position.\"\n\nGiven the fact that Alexander-Arnold is hailed as one of England's most naturally gifted players, such a backwards claim from the Red Devils legend will inevitably prompt scratched heads and raised eyebrows back on Merseyside. While lesser players were shoved at full-back in Neville's day, it was a very different story when the Scouser burst through Liverpool's academy and into the first team.\n\nYet the debate is set to rage on throughout the European Championships as the biggest talking point regarding Southgate's team selections. All Alexander-Arnold can do in the meantime is do his talking out on the pitch.\n\nEngland have been unable to make the most of his talent throughout his international career so far, but it's a different story at Liverpool where a fluid side is built to help get the best out of him.\n\nRegardless of what happens in Germany, that won't change when he returns to the Reds and links up with Slot for the first time. Be it as a defender, midfielder or hybrid, his importance at Anfield is obvious.\n\nIf England fail to get the best out of him, that's their problem. It's easy to beat the full-back with a stick and question his role, but if you really think he's 'not good enough' and that's why made his name as a right-back, then you haven't been paying close enough attention.\n\nNo-one wants to grow up and be a Gary Neville. But every young, Scouse Liverpool supporter grows up dreaming of being Trent Alexander-Arnold.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "theo_squires@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Theo Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C._Reserves_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C.

We know it's an experiment and we know that we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips. We're trying some different things and at the moment we're not flowing as we'd like, that's for sure.\"\n\n\"Southgate's comment about Kalvin Phillips is so very weird,\" said one England fan in response. \"Pick him then or, alternatively, perhaps don't let it be known publicly that you think he's done at 28 years old when the shambles we've just witnessed was nothing to do with him.\"\n\n\"Why the f*** do we need a 'Natural replacement' for Kalvin Phillips? Mainoo and Wharton are both better players. F****** play one of them,\" fumed another. A third added: \"The fact he is saying we are playing bad because we don't have Kalvin Phillips might be the most horrifying thing of all.\"\n\nPhillips has made 31 appearances for England since his debut in 2020, but has been dropped by Southgate after struggling for game time at Manchester City and then enduring a disastrous loan stint at West Ham.\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, Southgate said England are \"a better team\" when Phillips is playing at his best but admitted he had to drop the 28-year-old due to his recent struggles.\n\n\"At the moment, I couldn't be confident on the performances Kalvin's had in the last few weeks that he could go onto the field and do the job we know that he's capable of,\" Southgate told BBC Radio 5 Live in March.\n\n\"So, there's absolutely no reason why he can't find that form. Nothing would give us more pleasure than having a Kalvin that's back in the rhythm of playing and back to full confidence. We will be a better team, squad, whatever that might be, if that's the case, so we're hoping he can find that.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The partnership with Declan Rice was non-existent, unbalanced and too often overrun by Denmark, with their midfield revolving around the veteran Christian Eriksen.\n\nSouthgate made mention of the absence of Kalvin Phillips, who has become a maligned figure throughout his struggles with Manchester City and on loan at West Ham United, but was so influential in England's run to the Euro 2020 final.\n\nPhillips was a solid defensive shield, adept at scenting danger, an unspectacular anchor in that area but an important one. It was why Southgate kept faith with him until the player's lack of fitness and form meant he could no longer justify his selection.\n\nPhillips was also a strong physical presence, allowing Rice to move in and get closer to opponents to exert pressure, which he has not been able to achieve against either Serbia or Denmark.\n\nThe presence of Phillips also allowed Rice to spread his own influence wider. He was not only a holding midfield player but also capable of making surging, creative runs from midfield as he did to such great effect for Arsenal this season.\n\nHere, both dropped deep to protect the defence, Rice perhaps feeling that responsibility even more acutely because Alexander-Arnold's strengths lie in positions further forward.\n\nRice was barely seen other than protecting England's defence in their two group games, robbing Southgate of an important, high-quality weapon, while Alexander-Arnold's natural attacking instincts make him occasionally vulnerable in front of the back four.\n\nIt was the worst of both worlds, resulting in a torrid, tortuous experience all round for England, not just in midfield.\n\nKane, despite scoring, was barely involved elsewhere while even Jude Bellingham looked leg-weary and off the pace. He was fortunate not to join his captain in being substituted after 69 minutes as Southgate looked to his bench for answers.\n\nThe manner in which Kane has been marginalised in both games must also be a source of concern. England simply have to find a way of getting their world-class captain and striker into the game and once again he was, goal aside, peripheral.\n\nChelsea's Conor Gallagher has emerged as the most likely replacement for Alexander-Arnold in midfield, but even he managed to earn himself a cheap yellow card shortly after coming on. He will be favourite to face Slovenia but Southgate may even look at Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo or Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace.\n\nEngland knew victory would leave them top of Group C after Serbia snatched a late draw with Slovenia, but if the idea inspired them they had a funny way of showing it.\n\nWatching England is too often becoming rinse and repeat. Take the lead. Fall back.\n\nSerbia were not good enough to punish Southgate's side but Denmark, under the shrewd leadership of coach Kasper Hjulmand, relished the opportunity.\n\nSouthgate insists he does not ask England to drop into conservative mode when they go ahead but it is a recurring theme - which means either the manager's message is not getting across or he needs to put it over with greater force.\n\nThe positive England can draw on is that they did not lose and still remain in a strong position to top their group heading into the last 16.\n\nSouthgate will not panic, nor should he, but he must also accept England have to improve against Slovenia. Their potential future Euro 2024 opponents Italy, France and Spain will not lose sleep after watching those struggles on an admittedly poor playing surface.\n\nPhil Foden's place in the side was a major conversation before kick-off. He was another removed with more than 20 minutes left but he was England's most dangerous player - not amid stiff competition admittedly - and struck the post in the second half.\n\nSouthgate, instead, went like-for-like as he replaced Kane with Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka with Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze coming on for Foden. There were no answers to be found there, although Watkins did force a save from Kasper Schmeichel. Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer were left kicking their heels.\n\nCrystal Palace defender Marc Guehi again emerged with credit with another solid display in defence but there were very few other straws for Southgate to clutch at.\n\nEngland remain at the top of the group but ambitions must stretch further than a place in the knockout stages given the expectations that accompanied Southgate and his players to Germany.\n\nHere, under the roof in Frankfurt, England flouted their billing as pre-tournament favourites.\n\nEngland's supporters made their feelings clear from early in the second half. There were several outbursts of loud jeering throughout that period and the response at the final whistle was predictably hostile.\n\nSouthgate and England's players will make all the right noises but they have delivered one indifferent, patchy performance and one abysmal one.\n\nIf they are to justify those pre-tournament hopes, they need to move up almost every gear instantly otherwise England will get nowhere near to lifting the trophy in Berlin on 14 July.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

England have some of the world's best, let them have fun", "body": "England have turned up at a party but forgotten to join in.\n\nEveryone's having a brilliant time here in Germany, letting rip, especially the hosts, but England are being standoffish. They'll stay on at the party, bore people, get knocked out and carried home on a wave of disapproval.\n\nEngland need to liven up sharpish. They certainly didn't raise the roof in the Frankfurt Arena here during the 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nSo many other teams are throwing themselves into attack, the young Turks bringing so much to the party, but not England.\n\nIt says everything that Gareth Southgate's best player over their two Group C games has been a defender, Marc Guehi; he also took responsibility when making a mistake to race back and rectify it.\n\nOtherwise England looked almost asleep, three lie-ins on a bed-shirt, against the confident, better-organised Danes.\n\nSouthgate praised his players' commitment. He emphasised they do care, and they do. Anyone who has spent any time around Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Jordan Pickford, Bukayo Saka, well all of them, knows how much they care.\n\n\"If anything, they care too much,\" Southgate said.\n\nThese are good players, three of them voted the best in England, Germany and Spain this season. But they weren't as well-prepared as Denmark, weren't as compact or as effective in the press.\n\nENGLAND PLAYER RATINGS: Declan Rice gets 2/10 as Gareth Southgate told to make 'drastic changes'\n\nYet these are club captains, experienced internationals, some of them valued as \u00a3100million, and four of whom have conquered Europe at club level. It's so frustrating.\n\nThese are good players. At club level, seven are regularly selected and prepared for action by such exceptional managers as Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta and, until recently, Jurgen Klopp. Good managers, good judges. And the players have delivered for them.\n\nSo is Southgate the problem? He rarely gets much criticism from the media because everyone rightly lauds the cultural changes he's made to England, because the squad were leaderless and clueless before, and because he's genuine.\n\nTalking to England fans after the game it was clear their unhappiness but their mood was certainly not mutinous towards Southgate.\n\nOne fan pointed out that for Denmark's goal: \"The best striker in the world (Kane) gave the ball away and the best midfielder in the world (Bellingham) didn't track back. They messed up. That's not on Southgate.\"\n\nHe did add that, stationed in the centre of the Block 109, England's most loyal following, there was \"the most discontent I've seen from an England crowd since we lost 4-0 to Hungary at Molineux\" two years ago.\n\n\"We need the fans,\" Southgate said. \"They have been absolutely brilliant in the stadium and I completely understand their frustration at the way we played.\n\nThe fan pointed out, in defence of Southgate, that given concerns going into the tournament the back four has been fine. So he's organised the defence. But the attack? England are too fearful, too conservative.\n\nSouthgate's giving everything he has to steer England to a trophy. But is his best good enough? Can nice guys finish first? These questions have to be answered.\n\nAnd he can answer them. England, stung by the criticism, can easily top the group, heading into a last 16 tie in Gelsenkirchen on June 30 against the third best side from the group containing Poland, Austria, Netherlands and France.\n\nHe has improved at his changes, moving more quickly against Denmark, albeit to no effect. He changed players but not the cautious mood as a Guardiola, Arteta or Klopp would.\n\n\"It's for me to find better solutions than in the last couple of matches,\" Southgate said.\n\nBuilding around Bellingham as his No.10 is a must. He might have to commit an act of heresy and omit Phil Foden for the natural width that Anthony Gordon brings on the left; it would be a huge call.\n\nHe needs to urge players not always come for the ball to feet, but to attack in behind as, in fairness, Saka tried.\n\nMost of all, he must restore England's joy. The irrepressible Jack Grealish is certainly a miss.\n\nReflecting on the party feel of this European Championship, the Denmark head coach, Kasper Hjulmand said: \"People come here to celebrate football.\" England need to do that, to entertain more. They have to get rid of the anxiety.\n\nEngland have some magnificent players but they are less than the sum of their substantial parts - that's down to Southgate.\n\nIt's not too late to join the fun as embodied by Germany here, to turn from wall-flowers to the life and soul of the party.\n\nBut Southgate needs to let England's players live a little.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com",

If we hadn't had Declan Rice, I don't know where we'd have been. Unfortunately, Kalvin was not possible for us for this tournament.\n\n\"So, we're trying to find something different and some of that has worked, some of that hasn't worked so well. But, over the years, that's been a consistent problem. We've tried to find the best way of solving it and we've got to do that in the coming weeks as well.\n\n\"They are the problems and we need to find the solutions. We need to assess the two performances and work through it together. If you allow players to pick passes then they can play passes which can hurt you.\"\n\nPhillips was the find of England's last Euros campaign, with his performances helping earn him a big-money transfer to Manchester City the following summer.\n\nBut the move backfired spectacularly, with Pep Guardiola accusing him of being overweight - comments for which the City manager later apologised - and Phillips making just 16 appearances before being loaned to West Ham United in January.\n\nHe made the switch in the hope of playing his way into England's Euro 2024 squad but that, too, fell flat.\n\nAdmitting playing Alexander-Arnold had been an experiment, Southgate added: \"He's had some moments where he's delivered what we thought he would. We know it's an experiment. \"We know we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips. We're trying different things and, at the moment, we're not flowing as we'd like.\"\n\nGary Neville suggested Rice was not good enough to play the holding role Phillips had once made his own.\n\n\"When he goes to receive the ball deep, I think he's quite basic at that,\" Neville told ITV.\n\nMeanwhile, Southgate also lamented the absence of Luke Shaw, who is still not fit enough to start at the Euros.\n\n\"At the moment, it's clear in terms of the balance of the team that we don't have our best left-back available,\" he said. \"So that denies you the opportunity for that balance.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/J3Gdff9n6W1suhsw8XFyyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/c465c89cd642677085f792c56268b852", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668748", "eventUri": "eng-9668748", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 456619943, "relevance": 2}

The Indian will also compete in the National Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar before targeting the Paavo Nurmi Games and ultimately defending his Olympic title.\n\nOlympic champion Neeraj Chopra's Paris Games preparations will be put through a stern test when he begins his season in the first leg of the prestigious Diamond League one-day meet series against a star-studded but familiar field, here on Friday.\n\nThe 26-year-old Indian javelin superstar, who is also the reigning world and Asian Games champion, will be up against the likes of former world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada and Olympic and world-medallist Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic.\n\nAsian Games silver-medallist and his compatriot Kishore Jena will also be in the fray as he makes his Diamond League debut.

I really like to be consistent, it is one of my greatest weapons. I will throw over 90m but consistency is more important,'' Chopra said in a pre-event press conference.\n\nEuropean champion Julian Weber of Germany, fourth in the Olympic Games and World Championships, will also compete in the 10-man field. The league will then move to Morocco on May 19.\n\nChopra is also the defending champion here as he had set the tone for his title-laden 2023 season with a victory ahead of Vadlejch and Peters.\n\n''Success depends on team work. My coach and physio make immense contribution. The coach reviews my technique and we talk on what's the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training.

Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra's Paris Games preparations will be put through a stern test when he begins his season in the first leg of the prestigious Diamond League one-day meet series against a star-studded but familiar field, here on Friday.\n\nDoha, May 9 (PTI) Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra's Paris Games preparations will be put through a stern test when he begins his season in the first leg of the prestigious Diamond League one-day meet series against a star-studded but familiar field, here on Friday.\n\nThe 26-year-old Indian javelin superstar, who is also the reigning world and Asian Games champion, will be up against the likes of former world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada and Olympic and world-medallist Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic.\n\nAlso Read | GT vs CSK, Ahmedabad Weather, Rain Forecast and Pitch Report: Here's How Weather Will Behave for Gujarat Titans vs Chennai Super Kings IPL 2024 Clash at Narendra Modi Stadium.\n\nAsian Games silver-medallist and his compatriot Kishore Jena will also be in the fray as he makes his Diamond League debut. Jena has a personal best of 87.54m while Chopra's all-time best is 89.94m, which is also the national record.\n\n\"I think I am ready for tomorrow. I really like to be consistent, it is one of my greatest weapons. I will throw over 90m but consistency is more important,\" Chopra said in a pre-event press conference.\n\nAlso Read | Is Philips Written on Travis Head's Cap As A Tribute to Late Phillip Hughes? And Was He Crying When KL Rahul Asked About It? Here's The Truth.\n\nEuropean champion Julian Weber of Germany, fourth in the Olympic Games and World Championships, will also compete in the 10-man field. The league will then move to Morocco on May 19.\n\nChopra is also the defending champion here as he had set the tone for his title-laden 2023 season with a victory ahead of Vadlejch and Peters.\n\n\"Success depends on team work. My coach and physio make immense contribution. The coach reviews my technique and we talk on what's the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training. Planning has been key,\" Chopra was quoted as saying in a Sports Authority of India release.\n\nThe Indian had sent the spear to a distance of 88.67m then as against the 88.63m and 85.88m of Vadlejch and Peters respectively.\n\nIn 2022, Peters had delivered the fifth-longest throw in history (93.07m) at the Qatar Sports Club here.\n\nVadlejch, the Tokyo Olympics silver-medallist and 2023 Diamond League champion had recorded a personal best of 90.88m here in 2022.\n\nChopra has won three individual legs of Diamond League and lifted the champion's trophy in 2022.\n\nAfter this event, Chopra will compete at home for the first time in three years during the National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships to be held in Bhubaneswar from May 12 to 15.\n\nJena will also be taking part in the event. As per the schedule, the men's javelin qualifying round will be held on May 14 and the final will take place on May 15.\n\nChopra last took part in a domestic competition at the same Federation Cup on March 17, 2021, when he won a gold with a throw of 87.80m.\n\nAfter taking part in the domestic event, Chopra will compete in the prestigious Paavo Nurmi Games in Turku, Finland on June 18.\n\nAt that event, he will be up against 19-year-old sensation Max Dehning of Germany, the latest entrant to the 90m club.\n\nHis goal for this season is to defend his Olympic title and to break the elusive 90m barrier. In an earlier interview to PTI, Chopra had stressed on the need to stay injury-free.\n\nIn the current Paris Olympics cycle, Government has spent close to Rs four crore to assist Chopra's training, equipment, coach's salary and out-of-pocket allowances.\n\nHe attributed his preparedness to the training he has undergone overseas at different international centres in Finland, South Africa, UK and Turkey at various times.\n\n\"After Tokyo, I found out how international athletes plan their schedule and choose their training centres so that there is minimum travel, quicker acclimatisation and proper diet leading up to a major event.\n\n\"These are finer details that I discuss with my coach and once a decision is made, we approach TOPS for assistance. It has worked well for us,\" he said.\n\nChopra said adjusting to a proper diet has also been part of the that has helped him to get better.\n\n\"Yes, you have to get used to some bland food. Initially, it was tough when I was not getting Indian food but I have got used to this not-so-tasty food,\" said Chopra, adding that his diet is largely vegetarian.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Vadlejch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakub Vadlejch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Neeraj Chopra is back in action and this year the stakes are even higher. India's greatest ever athlete is set to begin his 2024 season at the Doha Diamond League on Friday night as he steps up preparations for his Olympic gold defence later this year.\n\nChopra will be joined by his compatriot Kishore Kumar Jena, in both of their first competitions since last year's epic battle at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where Jena pushed Chopra right to the end before the veteran defended his title.\n\nQuite unlike his schedule in previous years, Chopra has two events lined up in a span of just five days. After Doha, he is scheduled to compete at the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar on May 15. With the spotlight on Paris Olympics in July-August, there will an increased focus on Chopra's double-event start to the season.\n\nChopra had opened his 2023 season in Doha as well, winning last year's meeting with an 88.67m throw, just 0.04m ahead of Jakub Vadlejch, who is once again likely to be his closest competitor. In fact, Vadlejch won the Diamond League trophy last year, beating Chopra in the final that was held in Eugene just a few days after the Indian won the World Championships gold in Budapest.\n\nLast month, Chopra had said that his two main aims in 2024 are to defend his Olympic title and to breach the 90m mark. The latter has become a big talking point over the last few years. His personal best remains the 89.94m that he set at the Stockholm Diamond League in 2022. Although he has won every gold medal there is to win in the sport at least once, the psychological barrier posed by the 90m mark still does exist.\n\nIn the past, Doha has proven to have conducive conditions for big throws to be made. In 2022, the Grenadian Anderson Peters recorded the fifth-longest throw in history with 93.07m while Vadlejch also recorded his personal best of 90.88m on the same evening.\n\nChopra has always been a bit blas\u00e9 about the 90m mark, saying that he was winning competitions without it, so that would be enough. However, this year seems different. Having won the World Championships last year, there's nothing left in this sport that he hasn't won and now may be the time to push the boundaries and increase that personal best.\n\nAs always, Vadlejch will not be left too far behind. Jena will also be looking to make a strong start to his season ahead of his Olympic debut, as Indian javelin looks to continue the momentum that was built in 2023, which peaked when three Indians finished in the top 6 at the World Championships in Budapest.\n\nThe entry list for Doha doesn't feature the young German sensation Max Dehning yet. Chopra's first competition against Dehning is scheduled to be at next month's Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland.\n\nFive of the 10 athletes in the field have already competed this season, with Vadlejch having recorded an 87m throw at the ASA Athletics Grand Prix in Potchefstroom, South Africa. Peters, though, seems to have continued his form from 2023, which wasn't encouraging at all. He only recorded a best throw of 80.69m at the Grenadian Championships in March, a far cry from the consistent 90m thrower that he had moulded himself into around 2022.\n\nFormer world champions Julius Yego and Asian Games bronze medallist Roderick Genki Dean also form part of a competitive field, which just needs to add Arshad Nadeem and a couple of the Germans to be the strongest possible in javelin at the moment.\n\nThe javelin throw starts at 7:42pm local time on Friday, May 10, which is 10:12pm IST.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [],

Reuters\n\nReigning Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra opened up on the difficulty of preparing for events in India and why he opts to train abroad for the most part, saying his stardom often came in the way of focusing on his goal in his home country.\n\nThe javelin star, who has also won gold at the World Championships besides standing on top of the podium in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics , will begin his season in the Doha Diamond League on Friday with his focus firmly set on the Paris Olympics that will take place between 26 July and 11 August.\n\n\"For me more important is my sport. It's good for my profile if I play in India but there are too many functions, marriage functions. I also want to join my family and friends but more than that, I want to train in an Olympic year,\" the youngster from Haryana told reporters at a pre-competition press conference in Doha.\n\n\"Before Tokyo (Olympics), I always trained in India but right now I just want to focus on my game. I will train in India later,\" he added.\n\nFrom Doha, he will fly to Bhubaneswar next week to compete on home turf for the first time in three years during the 12 to 15 May Federation Cup.\n\nAlso Read | As Neeraj Chopra starts his 2024 season at Doha Diamond League, breaching 90m mark shouldn't be only focus\n\nHe is aware of being a familiar face in India and how his presence elevates the stature of his sport in the country.\n\n\"It's not like cricketers, like Virat Kohli or MS Dhoni but lot of people know me. I go to India sometimes, people know me, which is good for athletics. People know about athletics and follow athletics because of the Olympic gold,\" said the athlete, who has spent the better part of the last few months training in South Africa, Turkey and Switzerland.\n\nAsked if he has plans to compete in every Diamond League event, Chopra said his \"coach will decide.\"\n\nThe conversation eventually veered towards the elusive 90m mark and Chopra said he would rather do it than talk about it.\n\n\"About 90m, last year I said I will throw 90 and threw 88. This year, I don't want to say, I want to show,\" he said.\n\n\"People have been asking me this question since 2018, when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games. But, a lot of things happened, my elbow injury, the surgery and now I have been stuck between 88 and 90m,\" he said.\n\n\"I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But, we were not lucky due to too much of head wind. But maybe tomorrow we'll have a good day,\" he said.\n\nChopra said he knows the expectations from him every time he steps into a stadium to compete but he tries to focus more on his technique.\n\n\"&mldr;obviously, it is the Olympics year and India is a big country and everyone expects gold. But, it's really hard in Olympics because the best from the world are competing with you.\n\n\"My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique. And yes, if I stay healthy everything will be good.\"\n\nThere was also a question on his flowing mane and how it is becoming a rage among youngsters who look up to him.\n\n\"No, it's not good for throwing without bandana. You can't see the foul line,\" he quipped while breaking into a chuckle.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doha Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Neeraj-Chopra-Hangzhou-Asian-Games-Reuters-1200-2024-05-29e23b7ee71fff42f69d80aa06074ff3.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552767", "eventUri": "eng-9552767", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-26", "dateEnd": "-08-11", "textStart": 685, "textEnd": 706}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "dateEnd": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1289, "textEnd": 1301}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 165}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

In Budapest last year, we had three Indians (out of the top six) in the finals and that has made us believe we are no less than the Europeans who have dominated world javelin for so long. We have to take this Budapest belief forward and in Paris anything is possible,\" said Chopra in an interview with SAI Media.\n\nManu DP is in line to join Chopra and Jena in Paris 2024. Manu is yet to breach the qualifying standard of 85.50 metres but is placed comfortably in the 11th spot in the Road to Paris rankings. That should be enough to earn him a ticket to Paris unless several others pass him and he is unable to improve his own distance.\n\nAt the Indian Grand Prix I in Bengaluru recently, DP Manu won the men's javelin throw competition with an effort of 81.91m, adrift of the Paris Olympics qualification mark of 85.50m and his personal best of 84.35. Manu had been training in Potchefstroom, South Africa with his coach Kashinath Naik, a former Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.\n\nLeading up to the new outdoor season and until the Olympics, proper and intense training has been a top priority for the javelin throwers and all three - Chopra, Jena and Manu - have benefited from the government's Target Olympic Podium Scheme that funds athletes to prepare and peak at global events, especially the Summer Games.\n\nIn the current Paris Olympics cycle, the government has spent more than 4.87 Crore INR on these three javelin throwers with Chopra receiving close to 4 Crore INR alone. The major expenses include training and competition related, equipment, coach's salary and out-of-pocket allowances.\n\nChopra said he had always paid attention to his overseas training and has meticulously chosen his competition schedule so that he is fully prepared ahead of a major global event. It will be no different ahead of Paris.\n\n\"The entire scenario changes when you arrive at the Games Village. The real pressure starts building up then. But I should be prepared,\" said Chopra.\n\nThe genial 26-year-old Chopra attributed his preparedness to the training he has undergone overseas at different international centres in Finland, South Africa, UK and Turkey at various times.\n\nThe reigning Diamond League champion said, \"After Tokyo, I found out how international athletes plan their schedule and choose their training centres so that there is minimum travel, quicker acclimatisation and proper diet leading up to a major event. These are finer details that I discuss with my coach and once a decision is made, we approach TOPS for assistance. It has worked well for us.\"\n\n\"Success depends on teamwork. My coach and physio make immense contributions. The coach reviews my technique and we talk on what's the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training. Planning has been key,\" he added.\n\nA foodie at heart, Chopra says adjusting to a proper diet has been part of a process that has helped him to get better. It's a bit of a sacrifice too for a Haryanvi lad who loves his home-made churma (made from crushed Indian bread, sugar and ghee) and gulab jamun (a traditional fried Indian dessert made from milk and flour) with ice-cream.\n\n\"Yes, you have to get used to some bland food. Initially, it was tough when I was not getting Indian food but I have got used to this not-so-tasty food,\" said Chopra, adding that his diet is largely vegetarian.\n\nChopra emphasized that while \"belief\" will play an important part going forward from Doha, he cautioned that performance can never be guaranteed.\n\n\"It will be on how we do on that day. I strongly believe we all are training hard and doing a Budapest encore is not impossible,\" Chopra stated.\n\nChopra, the Indian superstar, who threw a world-leading 88.67 meters to win the gold medal last year in Doha, will start as a favourite in a field that is expected to feature Jakub Vadlejch (Czech), Anderson Peters (Grenada), Max Dehning (Germany) and Jena among others.

He emphasized the need for India to carry forward the belief from the World Championships in Budapest, where Indian throwers held three out of the top six in the final.\n\nIndia's javelin stars will kick off the outdoor season in the Doha leg of the Diamond League season on May 10. Leading the challenge will be reigning world champion Chopra and his comrade-in-arm, Kishore Jena.\n\nThe events, including the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar on May 14-15, leading to Paris 2024 will also evaluate the returns from some intense overseas training under top coaches.\n\nChopra and Jena, who produced a historic gold-silver finish at the Hangzhou Asian Games, have both qualified for the upcoming Summer Olympics in July-August, but Chopra believes a third javelin thrower, DP Manu, should make the Paris cut as well.\n\n\"There was a time when I was not even sure of qualifying for a World Championship but see how times have changed. In Budapest last year, we had three Indians (out of the top six) in the finals and that has made us believe we are no less than the Europeans who have dominated world javelin for so long. We have to take this Budapest belief forward and in Paris anything is possible,\" Chopra told SAI Media.\n\nManu is in line to join Chopra and Jena in Paris 2024. Manu is yet to breach the qualifying standard of 85.50 metres but is placed comfortably in the 11th spot in the Road to Paris rankings. That should be enough to earn him a ticket to Paris unless several others pass him and he is unable to improve his own distance.\n\nAt the Indian Grand Prix I in Bengaluru recently, Manu won the men's javelin throw competition with an effort of 81.91m, adrift of the Paris Olympics qualification mark of 85.50m and his personal best of 84.35. He had been training in Potchefstroom, South Africa with his coach Kashinath Naik, a former Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.\n\nLeading up to the new outdoor season and until the Olympics, proper and intense training has been a top priority for the javelin throwers and all three - Chopra, Jena and Manu - have benefited from the government's Target Olympic Podium Scheme (YOPS) that funds athletes to prepare and peak at global events, especially the Summer Games.\n\nIn the current Paris Olympics cycle, Government has spent more than Rs 4.87 cr on these three javelin throwers with Chopra receiving close to Rs 4 cr alone. The major expenses include training and competition related, equipment, coach's salary and out-of-pocket allowances.\n\nChopra said he had always paid attention to his overseas training and has meticulously chosen his competition schedule so that he is fully prepared ahead of a major global event. It will be no different ahead of Paris. \"The entire scenario changes when you arrive at the Games Village. The real pressure starts building up then. But I should be prepared,\" said Chopra.\n\nThe 26-year-old Chopra attributed his preparedness to the training he has undergone overseas at different international centres in Finland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Turkey at various times.\n\nThe reigning Diamond League champion said, \"After Tokyo, I found out how international athletes plan their schedule and choose their training centres so that there is minimum travel, quicker acclimatisation and proper diet leading up to a major event. These are finer details that I discuss with my coach and once a decision is made, we approach TOPS for assistance. It has worked well for us.\n\n\"Success depends on teamwork. My coach and physio make immense contributions. The coach reviews my technique and we talk about what's the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training. Planning has been key,\" said Chopra.\n\nA foodie at heart, Chopra says adjusting to a proper diet has been part of a process that has helped him to get better. It's a bit of a sacrifice too for a Haryanvi lad who loves his homemade churma and gulab jamun with ice cream.\n\n\"Yes, you have to get used to some bland food. Initially, it was tough when I was not getting Indian food but I have got used to this not-so-tasty food,\" said Chopra, adding that his diet is largely vegetarian.\n\nChopra emphasised that while \"belief\" will play an important part going forward from Doha, he cautioned that performance can never be guaranteed. \"It will be on how we do on that day. I strongly believe we all are training hard and doing a Budapest encore is not impossible,\" he said.\n\nChopra, who threw a world-leading 88.67 meters to win the gold medal last year in Doha, will

Chopra won the 2022 Diamond League series but finished as runner-up to Vadlejch last season.\n\nThis is Chopra's first appearance in the 2024 Diamond League season. In a pre-event press conference, Chopra shared his ambition of breaching the 90m mark this year, with an opportunity to achieve that feat at the Doha Diamond League.\n\nAt the pre-event press conference, Chopra said, \"People have been asking me this question since 2018 when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games. But, a lot of things happened, my elbow injury, the surgery & now I have been stuck between 88 and 90m. But I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But we were not lucky due to too much headwind.\n\n\"But maybe tomorrow we'll have a good day. And, obviously, it is the Olympics year and India is a big country and everyone expects Gold. But it's really hard in the Olympics because the best from the world are competing with you. My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique. And yes, if I stay healthy everything will be good,\" said Chopra.\n\nOther top athletes from various other disciplines will also be competing in Doha. Reigning Olympic gold medallists Steven Gardiner (Bahamas) and Soufiane El Bakkali (Morocco) will be in action, with Gardiner competing in the men's 400m while Bakkali aims to win the men's 3000m steeplechase.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the upcoming Diamond League 2024 -

Leading the challenge will be world and Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra along with compatriot and Asian Games silver medallist Kishore Jena.\n\nThe events, including the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar on May 14-15, leading to Paris 2024 will also evaluate the returns from some intense overseas training under top coaches.\n\nChopra and Jena, who produced a historic gold-silver finish at the Hangzhou Asian Games, have both qualified for the upcoming Summer Games in July-August, but Chopra, the poster boy of Indian athletics, believes a third javelin thrower - DP Manu - should make the Paris cut as well.\n\n\"There was a time when I was not even sure of qualifying for a world championship but see how times have changed. In Budapest last year, we had three Indians (out of the top six) in the finals and that has made us believe we are no less than the Europeans who have dominated world javelin for so long. We have to take this Budapest belief forward and in Paris anything is possible,\" Chopra was quoted as saying by SAI media.\n\nManu DP is in line to join Chopra and Jena at Paris 2024. Manu is yet to breach the qualifying standard of 85.50 metres but is placed comfortably in the 11th spot in the Road to Paris rankings. That should be enough to earn him a ticket to Paris unless several other pass him and he is unable to improve his own distance.\n\nAt the Indian Grand Prix I in Bengaluru recently, DP Manu won the men's javelin throw competition with an effort of 81.91m, adrift of the Paris Olympics qualification mark of 85.50m and his personal best of 84.35. Manu had been training in Potchefstroom, South Africa with his coach Kashinath Naik, a former Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.\n\nLeading up to the new outdoor season and until the Olympics, proper and intense training has been a top priority for the javelin throwers and all three - Chopra, Jena and Manu - have benefited from the government's Target Olympic Podium Scheme that funds athletes to prepare and peak at global events, especially the Summer Games.\n\nIn the current Paris Olympics cycle, the Union sports ministry has spent more than Rs 4.87 crore on these three javelin throwers with Chopra receiving close to Rs 4 crore alone. The major expenses include training and competition related, equipment, coach's salary and out-of-pocket allowances.\n\nChopra said he had always paid attention to his overseas training and has meticulously chosen his competition schedule so that he is fully prepared ahead of a major global event. It will be no different ahead of Paris.\n\n\"The entire scenario changes when you arrive at the Games Village. The real pressure starts building up then. But I should be prepared,\" said Chopra.\n\nThe 26-year-old Chopra attributed his preparedness to the training he has undergone overseas at different international centres in Finland, South Africa, UK and Turkey at various times.\n\nThe reigning Diamond League champion said: \"After Tokyo, I found out how international athletes plan their schedule and choose their training centres so that there is minimum travel, quicker acclimatisation and proper diet leading up to a major event. These are finer details that I discuss with my coach and once a decision is made, we approach TOPS for assistance. It has worked well for us.\n\n\"Success depends on team work. My coach and physio make immense contribution. The coach reviews my technique and we talk on what's the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training. Planning has been key,\" said Chopra\n\nA foodie at heart, Chopra says adjusting to a proper diet has been part of a process that has helped him to get better. It's a bit of a sacrifice too for the Panipat lad who loves his home-made churma (made from crushed Indian bread, sugar and ghee) and gulab jamun (a traditional fried Indian dessert made from milk and flour) with ice-cream.\n\n\"Yes, you have to get used to some bland food. Initially, it was tough when I was not getting Indian food but I have got used to this not-so-tasty food,\" said Chopra, adding that his diet is largely vegetarian.\n\nChopra emphasized that while \"belief\" will play an important part going forward from Doha, he cautioned that performance can never be guaranteed. \"It will be on how we do on that day. I strongly believe we all are training hard and doing a Budapest encore is not impossible,\" said Chopra.\n\nChopra, who threw a world leading 88.67 meters to win the gold medal last year in Doha, will start as a favourite in a field that is expected to feature Jakub Vadlejch (Czech), Anderson Peters (Grenada), Max Dehning (Germany) and Jena among others.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com",

The mascot, La'eeb, stands tall along the promenade that overlooks the official logo that sits on an island in the middle of the Doha Bay.\n\nIt has been almost two years since the mega event had come to the small Gulf country, and the locals still talk about the excitement that came with the global competition, and the lull that followed. That stillness eases, however temporarily, when the other top quality sporting events that pepper the Qatari calendar come about.\n\nOne of those events is the Doha-leg of athletics' Diamond League. This is a meet where Olympic and World Champions across track and field disciplines will be competing. This is the event where India's Olympic and World Champion, and the defending Doha Diamond League winner Neeraj Chopra will be beginning his season.\n\n\"This is the start, this is where we test things,\" the javelin throw star said to Scroll, a day ahead of the meet.\n\n\"Training has been good, but I haven't played a competition since the Asian Games. Doha will be a good way to get into the competition mode. Goal will be to do well, but also see how things are, what is the results of months of training.\"\n\nChopra, now 26, is building towards the Paris Olympic Games in July, where he will defend the Olympic title he won at the delayed event in Tokyo in 2021. That was when he became the first-ever Indian to win an athletics gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nHe has grown in stature since then. With the World Championships gold medal he won last year, he has won a title in every major competition his sport has to offer him. Yet he has taken the time to identify areas of improvement.\n\nDuring his pre-season training in Potchefstroom, South Africa and Gloria, Turkey, there was a keen focus on strength and conditioning.\n\n\"I haven't changed a whole lot [about my training], and I also tried to improve the technique a little bit,\" he said. \"I thought I can work harder on strength. Other javelin throwers, especially the Europeans, are stronger.\"\n\nChopra's trophy cabinet, more often than not, finds a new inclusion every time he competes. But there has been a certain 90 metre barrier he is yet to break.\n\nIt is a barrier that will help him join an exclusive club of men's javelin throwers. But, in the greater scheme of things, it remains a cosmetic achievement. After all, Chopra has won an Olympic gold, World Championship gold (2023), Asian Games gold (2018 and 2023), Commonwealth Games gold (2018), and even the Diamond League Final (2022) without crossing 90 metres.\n\n\"[Consistency] is one of my strong points,\" he said in the pre-event press conference in Doha on Thursday. \"I like to be consistent. It's one of my greatest weapons. I will throw over 90m, but consistency is more important to me.\"\n\nCentral to the consistency and the accolades has been his time spent staying away from the distractions that would come his way if he stayed in India. He talked about how he is invited to all type of functions when he is at home.\n\n\"It is good for my profile if I train in India, but this is an Olympic year,\" he said at the press interaction. \"For me, my sport is most important.\"\n\nBut earlier this week, he added another tournament to his calendar in the build-up to Paris - the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar that takes place on May 15.\n\n\"It was not essential for me, but right now, for Indian athletics, it will be good [for me] to compete there,\" he explained to this publication.\n\n\"I feel like I am at that stage where I have to support Indian athletics. This is an Olympics year and ideally I wanted to focus on international competitions, but I think this will be better for Indian athletics. I don't want people to only follow javelin or my tournaments. I want people to come and watch and support other athletics events too.\"\n\nHis popularity in India is undeniable. He is also endeared of the world athletics community. Reigning Olympic men's long jump champion Miltiadis Tentoglou chimed that he hopes Chopra will cross the 90m mark in Doha.\n\nHis best so far is the 89.94m national record he threw at the Stockholm Diamond League meet in 2022 - an event Grenada's Anderson Peters won after throwing 90.31m.\n\nBut Chopra asserted that he just wants to \"do his best.\"\n\n\"The main thing [about winning the Olympic gold] was that I handled the pressure of such a big competition,\" he said in the press conference. \"I got a lot of confidence in myself. It helped me so that even once I go to Paris, I feel that I can [win]. Even if things are not going well, I know that I can handle myself till the end. This is something that will help me.\n\n\"I know how to handle the pressure now, even if my body is not with me. If my mind is with me then I can throw better. I've trained hard for Paris. I have no distance in my mind, 92 or 93, I just want to put my best.\"\n\nIn Doha, on Friday, Chopra will begin his 2024 season. The targets are clear, especially with the Olympics coming up. One target remains the same - the one he said he has been reminded of since 2018. The target within touching distance. The one just 90 metres away.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shahid_judge@scroll.in", "name": "Shahid Judge", "type": "author",

It's good for my profile if I play in India but there are too many functions, marriage functions. I also want to join my family and friends but more than that, I want to train in an Olympic year,\" the youngster from Haryana told reporters at a pre-competition press conference.\n\n\"Before Tokyo (Olympics), I always trained in India but right now I just want to focus on my game. I will train in India later,\" he added.\n\nFrom here, he will fly to Bhubaneswar next week to compete on home turf for the first time in three years during the May 12 to 15 Federation Cup.\n\nHe is aware of being a familiar face in India and how his presence elevates the stature of his sport in the country.\n\n\"It's not like cricketers, like Virat Kohli or M S Dhoni but lot of people know me. I go to India sometimes, people know me, which is good for athletics. People know about athletics and follow athletics because of the Olympic gold,\" said the athlete, who has spent the better part of the last few months training in South Africa, Turkey and Switzerland.\n\nAsked if he has plans to compete in every Diamond League event, Chopra said his \"coach will decide.\"\n\nThe conversation eventually veered towards the elusive 90m mark and Chopra said he would rather do it than talk about it.\n\n\"About 90m, last year I said I will throw 90 and threw 88. This year, I don't want to say, I want to show,\" he said.\n\n\"People have been asking me this question since 2018, when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games. But, a lot of things happened, my elbow injury, the surgery and now I have been stuck between 88 and 90m,\" he said.\n\n\"I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But, we were not lucky due to too much of head wind. But maybe tomorrow we'll have a good day,\" he said.\n\nChopra said he knows the expectations from him every time he steps into a stadium to compete but he tries to focus more on his technique.\n\n\"...obviously, it is the Olympics year and India is a big country and everyone expects gold. But, it's really hard in Olympics because the best from the world are competing with you.\"\n\n\"My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique. And yes, if I stay healthy everything will be good.\"\n\nThere was also a question on his flowing mane and how it is becoming a rage among youngsters who look up to him.\n\n\"No, it's not good for throwing without bandana.

An hour or so after the pre-event press conference for the Doha Diamond League was over, Neeraj Chopra was still giving interviews to journalists, seeking exclusive quotes from India's javelin superstar. While others who attended the media conference - Steven Gardiner, Nina Kennedy and Miltiadis Tentoglou - had long left the venue and were taking much-needed rest before Friday's event at the Suhaim Bin Hamad Stadium, Chopra was in no hurry to leave.\n\nAmong many amazing qualities that the reigning Olympic, World and Asian champion possesses, it's his rare ability to handle every situation with composure and always sport a smile and pose for pictures for anyone who walks up to him.\n\nBut there is one question that has followed him ever since - by his own admission - he threw 88.06m at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, en route to winning the gold medal. When will he cross the 90m mark?\n\n\"I really want to break this barrier,\" Chopra said on Thursday, as he launches himself towards what he hopes will be a successful title defence at the Olympic Games in Paris this August.\n\nFellow Olympic and World long jump Champion Tentoglou, who was seated two seats away from Chopra, chipped in: \"I will be very happy if Neeraj throws 90m tomorrow, truly happy.\"\n\nThe Greek echoed what everyone in the athletics world would want. The 90m throw is a magic mark for a javelin thrower and Chopra - who set his personal best of 89.94 in 2022 - has never shied away from acknowledging that he needs to cross it one day. For an athlete, who has won all that needs to be won, the distance should not matter. But here is Chopra, who continues his quest for excellence despite having gone the distance no Indian has dared to achieve.\n\n\"I am stuck between 88 and 90 metres,\" said Chopra in a lighter vein on Thursday. \"This question has followed me ever since I threw 88.06 at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta. But I had elbow surgery soon after, which forced me to miss the 2019 season.\n\n\"But I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But, we were not lucky due to too much headwind. Maybe tomorrow we'll have a good day. Obviously, it is the Olympics year and India is a big country and everyone always expects gold. My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique. And yes, if I stay healthy everything will be good,\" the 26-year-old added.\n\nChopra, however, insisted remaining consistent has been his key to success in big events. \"Maybe it is my greatest weapon. I will throw over 90, but consistency is more important for me,\" he pointed out.\n\nChopra enjoys immense popularity in India but downplayed his celebrity status saying his decision to train in South Africa, Turkiye recently and in Europe later this year, was motivated by the need to focus on the Paris Olympics.\n\nOn Friday, Chopra will face competition from Jakub Vadlejch, to whom he finished second at the Diamond League final in Eugene last September but ended his season with victory at the Asian Games.\n\nThey will be joined by Grenada's two-time world champion Anderson Peters, who finished third behind Chopra and Vadlejch in Doha last year, plus 2015 world champion Julius Yego and world finalist Oliver Helander.\n\nThe women's pole vault features the indoor and outdoor world champions, as Australia's Nina Kennedy opens her Diamond League campaign against Britain's Molly Caudery, who competes for the first time since her world indoor triumph in Glasgow.\n\nKennedy said she was confident of adding Olympic gold later this year as she begins her season in Doha.\n\n\"The last two years in my career have been a huge step up. Two world medals and a Diamond League final winner. I will be going to this Olympics with a good shot. It's these new nerves and new feelings, which is all new to me. I am trying to approach it exactly like last year. I am excited but I am trying to enjoy this pressure,\" the Australian said.\n\nIn the men's long jump, world and Olympic champion Tentoglou makes his Doha Diamond League debut as part of a field also featuring Carey McLeod, Tajay Gayle and Simon Ehammer.\n\nThe 26-year-old athlete - who retained his world indoor title with victory in Glasgow in March - boasts a personal best of 8.60m from 2021 and is so far unbeaten this year. In recent years he has gained a reputation for being an exceptional championship performer and in particular, for his final jump heroics. \"I keep myself motivated because I love the event and love to jump,\" said Tentoglou, when asked about what motivates to keep going.\n\n\"I plan to get better every time and every year. This year is very special because of the Olympics in Paris. There are European Championships too next month. I am doing more quality training. It's going to be a difficult year but I am excited. I am definitely one of the best and other guys know that I can jump very well anytime so I think I put pressure on them,\" the Greek said.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news",

PTI\n\nAfter a gap of six months, India's only track-and-field Olympic and world champion, Neeraj Chopra, will embark on what will be the toughest season of his career as a javelin thrower. The 26-year-old begins his 2024 campaign with the Doha Diamond League where he won last year with a 88.67m throw.\n\nA winning start will be crucial as he looks to reach the season-ending finals and retain the title he won in 2022 before narrowly missing out on the gold last season with a silver-medal finish . But the Doha event assumes even more importance when you consider the fact that it's an Olympics year.\n\nIn 2021, Neeraj was a junior world champion when he went on to become the first Olympic gold medallist \u00c2 for India in athletics.\n\nThe 2024 season is going to be about becoming the first individual athlete from India to defend his gold medal at the Olympics - Paris 2024 .\n\nLooking at his record, one mustn't fuss much about his chances.\n\nFor someone who has managed to improve every year, evolve and make history, defending the Olympic gold doesn't seem that big a deal. After all, it's his elite talent and mentality that has continuously helped the javelin giant to put the spotlight on Indian athletics. There's one thing that Neeraj hasn't managed so far - hitting the 90m mark. He has a personal best of 89.94m , which is also the national record.\n\nIn Doha, Neeraj will be up against former world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada and three-time Diamond League winner and Tokyo silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch.\n\nVadlejch has already managed 87m this season and could be the biggest challenger as five of the 10 competitors in Doha are still to start their season.\n\nThe Czech is also going to benefit from the fact that he hit his personal best of 90.88m in Doha in 2022. The same year Peters, who beat Neeraj for Worlds gold in 2022, managed a whopping 93.07m at the Doha Diamond League.\n\nThe wind assistance at the Qatar Sports Club has often created favourable conditions for the javelin throwers so it could be the same this time.\n\nAnother factor that makes 90m even more valuable is the fact that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Max Dehning has been touching that coveted mark for fun recently.\n\nIn February this year, he became the youngest (19) to breach the 90m mark at the German Winter Throwing Championships 2024, and qualified for the Olympics. Neeraj will be meeting Dehning at the Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland next month and that will be quite a contest to look at. But in all honesty, while breaching the 90m mark is going to become a must for the Indian star, the best way to deal with the upcoming challenges is to stay true to what he has been doing all this while.\n\nThe secret of Neeraj's success is not humungous throws but his consistency and rhythm on competition days.\n\nLast year he won the Worlds gold with just his second throw which was 88.17m. This is not to say that he will win the upcoming events as well without touching the 90m mark but if he stays fit and finds his rhythm, his record is proof that can be enough.\n\n\"I will compete with Max at the Paavo Nurmi games. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never competed with him before. He went from throwing 79m straight into 90m. He skipped the 80m page completely. It will be fun to compete with him. When I competed at the Tokyo Olympics and also at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world championships, many athletes had throws over 90m. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a new thing to compete against people who have thrown that distance,\" Neeraj had said during an online interaction\u00c2 last month.\n\n\"What matters is what you can throw on that day. I am excited to get a chance to compete against them. The more they throw in competition, the more fun it becomes. When we are competing together, the main factor that determines the winner is who handles the situation on that day better than the others.\"\n\nThat's the secret, be the best at handling the situation and the rest will follow.\n\nKishore Jena also in focus\n\nEyes will also be on Kishore Jena who will be making his Diamond League debut. The Odia athlete has a personal best of 87.54m which helped him win the silver medal at the 2023 Asian Games. Indian athletics fraternity will be rooting for him to secure a top-three spot in Doha.\n\nThe event will take place on 10 May and is expected to start at 10.12 PM IST.\n\nMen's javelin throw live streaming\n\nThe Doha Diamond League will be live-streamed on JioCinema. The broadcast will be available on the Sports18 TV channel.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paavo_Nurmi_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paavo Nurmi Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Vadlejch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jakub Vadlejch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_assistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind assistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paavo_Nurmi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paavo Nurmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Neeraj-Chopra6-2024-05-37336d00fabae5d1c05ca12a19e2edc8-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552767", "eventUri": "eng-9552767", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 4335, "textEnd": 4341}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Even in the presence of some of the biggest names in world athletics, the spotlight remains firmly on him every time he gets ready to compete. It was no different on the eve of the Doha Diamond League on Thursday as Chopra declared he was ready and raring to start his Olympic title defence at the season-opener here.\n\nFlanked by reigning Olympic champions Steven Gardiner (400m), Miltiadis Tentoglou (long jump) and pole vault world champion Nina Kennedy, it was a largely Neeraj Chopra show and the 27-year old admitted, for perhaps the first time, that the Olympic or World Championships arena does matter.\n\n\"You don't feel it at that moment but you realise it later, when you leave the place, that it was a different feeling. In my mind and in my performances, the aim is to push myself to the limit every time. But Olympics is very rare,\" he admitted in an exclusive interaction with Sportstar, reflecting on why records are often made or broken elsewhere.\n\n\"There are five Diamond League meets in a year, that's 20 chances to set a record or get a new mark. In four years there is only one Olympics. That in itself is a pressure thing. You have to adjust and manage your body, mind, and everything to be working together perfectly at that level at that particular time to get a good result,\" he said.\n\n\"This is why I think even historically, many legendary athletes falter. If you see Jan Zelezny or Thomas Rohler, who otherwise have great performances but could not do it in the Olympics. I also felt it in Tokyo, the pressure of the moment and the arena, you know in your mind where you are standing and competing. It is not easy, but it's not impossible either,\" he insisted.\n\nALSO READ | Neeraj Chopra, Kishore Jena in action, Doha Diamond League 2024: Preview, start list, when and where to watch?\n\nThe 90m question did pop up, yet again, and Chopra deflected it in style, yet again, while throwing down the gauntlet for his competitors.\n\n\"Preparations have been good, I had a good session in the morning also and I am ready for tomorrow. I have been stuck between 88-90m and I really want to break this barrier. But my focus is to stay healthy and be consistent. This is one of my strong points, one of my greatest weapons. I know I will throw 90, but consistency is more important,\" he declared.\n\nAnd his secret to keeping that weapon deadly lies in his training. While his social media videos and reels only exhibit the physical workout Chopra puts in his training sessions, the real deal is in what isn't seen.\n\n\"The most important thing is to be very clear of your target in your mind during training. I am always aware that I have won the Olympics or World Championships, I know that my introduction at every competition, till Paris at least, will be as the current World and Olympic champion. There is the added responsibility of handling it the right way. For others, it is a motivation to reach there; for me, it is a responsibility to handle it carefully,\" Chopra explained.\n\n\"Even as a kid, when I was not into sports, I had the mindset of doing any work given to me properly and completely - even if it was something as mundane as feeding buffaloes. It's the same with training - my mindset is very good at that time, I am in my zone. All the confidence, handling of pressure etc comes from good training,\" he revealed.\n\nOne of the reasons for Chopra's popularity is his ability to respect everyone who walks up to him - from journalists wanting an exclusive chat to fans seeking a selfie or influencers hoping for viral content.

This year, I don't want to say, I want to show,\" he said.\n\n\"People have been asking me this question since 2018, when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games. But, a lot of things happened, my elbow injury, the surgery and now I have been stuck between 88 and 90m,\" he said.\n\n\"I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But, we were not lucky due to too much of head wind.

The affable champion, however, said he is not as popular as cricketers like Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni in the cricket-crazy home country.\n\nNeeraj Chopra, while speaking to the press on the eve of his first competitive event of the Olympic year -- the Doha Diamond League, said he appreciates the love and support from people back home.\n\n\"It's not like cricketers, like Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. But a lot of people know me after Tokyo. But I train outside now, most of the time. When I got to India, people knew me, it was good for Indian athletics. People know me, people know about javelin throw, people know about athletics. Now, in India, more people follow athletics because of the Olympic Gold and World Championships Gold,\" Neeraj said on Thursday, May 9.\n\nNeeraj Chopra's stardom has only grown with every title he has won at the highest level. The 26-year-old won India's first-ever Olympic gold medal in a track and field event in Tokyo and followed it up with the world championships title and the Diamond Trophy.\n\nNeeraj will begin his journey to double it up at the Paris Olympics at the Doha Diamond League, which he won last year. Having trained in South Africa and Turkey in the lead-up to the new season, Neeraj is confident of making a mark.\n\nWhile the much-talked-about 90m mark is in his bucket list, Neeraj said his biggest weapon is consistency and he would want to maintain it in the Olympic year. Neeraj's best effort came at the Asian Games last year -- he won Gold with 88.88m. However, his personal best stands at 89.94m.\n\n\"I am ready for it tomorrow. The training was good. The throwing sessions were really good. I am ready for tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe, this is one of my strong points. I like to be consistent. And maybe this is one of my greatest weapons. I will throw over 90, but consistency is more important for me,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Olympic champion also explained why he has not been training in India regularly in the lead-up to the Paris Games, saying he would want to have a lot more of his training stints in his home country.\n\n\"For me, my sport is very important right now. It's good for my profile if I train in India. But, there are too many functions, marriage functions and all that. I also want to join my family and my friends there, but right now it's Olympic year and I want to train more.\n\nYes, I was Potchefstroom in South Africa in winter, now I came from Gloria (Gloria Sports Academy in Antalya), Turkey and I will go to Europe for training before Paris. After Paris, maybe I will train in India. I will train in India for my next Olympics or the next major tournament. Also, before Tokyo, I was training in India. Everything is okay for me, but right now I want to focus on my game. But maybe, I will train in India more,\" Neeraj added.\n\nNeeraj and Asian Games silver medalist Kishore Jena will compete in a strong 10-man field at the Doha Diamond League on Friday, May 10.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potchefstroom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potchefstroom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Potchefstroom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antalya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Antalya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/neeraj-chopra-091946590-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=p2A9IO8ntXmeWXK8HX.CSxC2h8_gQr2I", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552767", "eventUri": "eng-9552767", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1039, "textEnd": 1044}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 3217, "textEnd": 3223}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

I have always wanted to compete in India, in an international competition with both Indian and foreign throwers. That hasn't happened so far, hopefully soon, but I feel good competing at home, in front of home crowds. It will be good for Indians to come and see and support athletics more. I spoke to the federation and there was always talk of my coming home for competition.\n\nALSO READ | 'I know I will throw 90m, but consistency is more important,' says Neeraj Chopra ahead of Doha Diamond League 2024\n\n\"We discussed about Inter-State meet also (in June) but then decided it was too close to Paris and I am also not sure of my competition schedule at that time. The closer it gets to the Olympics, the more selective it gets, so we decided on the Federation Cup. I have never thought as to why I should go for the Federation Cup instead of an international event elsewhere,\" he insisted.\n\nNeeraj won't be alone, though, with fellow Olympic qualifier and local favourite Kishore Kumar Jena also in action at home for the first time since the Asian Games.\n\n\"I am excited to perform in front of my own people, they always give a lot of love and support. Of course Neeraj bhai is a national icon and everyone's favourite but I think, maybe, since it's my home ground, I might get that wee bit extra support,\" Jena laughed.\n\nMaking his Diamond League debut, Jena insisted there was no nervousness. \"A little bit of anxiety is always good before big tournaments. But I am not nervous, I am just happy to compete with the big names here, these will be the same guys at the Olympics. I started 2023 with a season's best and that's what I am hoping for here also, only thinking about getting better without any target in mind,\" he said.\n\nAs for the pressure of competing against Neeraj, Jena had no doubts. \"I have learnt a lot from him. In fact, when competing with him anywhere, I feel very little pressure because he takes it all! But it really feels very good and with (DP) Manu also there, more the merrier, both of us and the country,\" Jena added.\n\nChopra, in fact, hinted he might train more at home, post Paris, if everything went well. \"There is no issue with facilities in India and I know it is good for my profile and good for Indian athletics also if I train in India but it gets too hectic, there are too many functions! I also want to be with my family but right now, I want to train more,\" he shrugged.\n\nHe still doesn't think of himself as a bonafide star, though. \"Yes, people know me after Tokyo but it's not like cricket, I am not like Virat Kohli or MS Dhoni! But people do recognise when I go home and I think it's good for Indian athletics.

However, he isn't putting any pressure on himself ahead of his maiden appearance in the Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday where Chopra will also be competing.\n\nSpeaking to TOI, the javelin thrower from Odisha said, \"It's my first competition of the season and my maiden Diamond League appearance and I just want to make a good start. I don't have any target in my mind and want to perform well and give my best.\"\n\nHe, however, does want to better his personal best of 87.54m which he achieved during the Asian Games last year that helped him grab the silver behind Neeraj and also qualify for Paris Olympics.\n\n\"More importantly there will be a number of competitions after this and I will be able to work on my performance,\" added Kishore, who trained at Gold Coast Performance Centre in Australia earlier this year.\n\nAfter the event in Doha, Jena will likely take part in National Federation Cup to be held in Bhubaneswar from May 12-15 where his name is part of the entry list. His coach Samarjeet Singh Malhi though added that they will decide on Jena's participation only after Diamond League.\n\nSpeaking on what he expects from Jena, who broke into the scene with his impressive show during the Worlds last year, Malhi said, \"It's a great chance to compete against the best throwers in the world. It will be his first Diamond League meeting and we are looking to gain experience from the event. After that we will make the required changes.\"\n\nMalhi, like his pupil, also isn't looking too far ahead at the moment and wants Jena to take things slowly. \"Since this will be start of the season, the load on the body will be a lot more and we will be looking to peak only at the Olympics,\" he added from Doha.\n\nWhile he has left no stone unturned to give his best in Doha, Jena did face a challenging time after coming back from Australia when his father suffered a brain stroke in March and had to be hospitalized. The Odia athlete rushed back home from Patiala to be by his side but with things stable at present, the 28-year-old remains quite calm about it and is focused on Friday's event.\n\nAs for the event itself, it will quite a big test considering he will be competing against former world champion Anderson Peters (PB 93.07m) of Grenada and Olympic and world-silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch (PB 90.88m) of Czech Republic besides Chopra (PB 89.94m) himself.\n\nIt would indeed be a huge boost for Jena if he is able to achieve a good result but right now more than the result what's important for him is to make a good start and gain some useful experience ahead of Paris Games.\n\nAnother great event where Jena will be able to gain experience is Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland on June 18 where Chopra will also be competing along with 19-year-old German sensation Max Dehning, who is the latest entrant in the 90m club.\n\nBut for now all eyes will be on Doha.", "source": {"uri":

For India's Neeraj Chopra, one of the most followed and revered sportspersons in the country, the path would be strewn with even bigger challenges. The pressure would be immense as well. When Neeraj runs to take his first throw of the season at the Diamond League in Doha on Friday, his eyes will be on the javelin but his mind will be fixed on Paris. He has to retain his Tokyo title, which, he had said, would be his primary objective.\n\nRemaining injury-free and getting a good start to the season will also be critical, especially when the Olympics is less than three months away. Neeraj and his team know it. He has been in a sublime touch ever since the Tokyo gold. Be it the worlds, Diamond Leagues or Asian Games, he has been in pristine form. The javelin leaves like a missile balanced and poised. So much has been his influence not just in India but across the world that people are trying to imitate his technique.\n\nWeeks ahead of his first competition, he had said during an interaction that he was feeling good about himself and was high on confidence. \"I expect to win every time I throw in a competition. I have won quite a few events as well. I won the silver and gold at World Championships, Diamond League Trophy and threw well and retained the Asian Games crown. So it was good. Mentally and physically, I think I'm prepared for the Olympics,\" he had said.\n\nThe Olympic champion, during the official press conference, said that he had a very good training stint. \"I am ready for tomorrow,\" he said. \"Consistency has been my strong point and I really like to be consistent and maybe this is one of my greatest strengths. I will throw over 90m but consistency is more important for me.\"\n\nOn his status in India, Neeraj said that the public craze is yet to reach the level of cricketers. \"It's not like cricketers like Virat Kohli or MS Dhoni but a lot of people know me after Tokyo. I train abroad now. I go to India sometimes but people know me. It is good for javelin and athletics. I think more people follow athletics and it's a good sign.\" Neeraj also said that future participation in DLs will depend on his coach.\n\nFor his coach Klaus Bartonietz, the transition from training to competition is crucial. \"It's different in competition. You are competing against men, physically in competition,\" he told this daily. \"You have to put your training to the test. Neeraj is feeling good and is positive. We will have to ensure that he remains injury-free. That will be a daunting task as well.\" Physio Ishaan Marwaha is by his side to take care of his fitness. Even Neeraj said that staying healthy will be his focus.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@newindianexpress.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Throws", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Throws", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-05%2F0d85051f-9ab2-437a-95c8-baf3db7bdb57%2Fpage_1.jpg?rect=0%2C708%2C5000%2C2625&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552767", "eventUri": "eng-9552767", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

This year, I don't want to say, I want to show,\" he said.\n\n\"People have been asking me this question since 2018, when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games.

But, it's really hard in Olympics because the best from the world are competing with you.\n\n\"My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique.

In 2022, he came within 6cm of it. Imagine. Six centimeters. That discussion is once again front and center as he gets ready for the title defence in Paris by opening his season with the Doha Diamond League. In an ideal world, 90m shouldn't matter as long as he keeps winning competitions with the best throw on the day. But it has now been built up to such mythical proportions that it's easy to imagine that he would want to get it out of the way quickly.\n\n\"People have been asking me this question since 2018 when I threw 88.06 at the Asian Games,\" Neeraj said on Thursday in Doha. \"A lot of things happened after that, my elbow injury, the surgery and now I have been stuck between 88 and 90m.\n\n\"But I really want to break the barrier this year. Even last year, I had said that Doha is famous for 90m. But, we were not lucky due to too much headwind. Maybe tomorrow we'll have a good day. Obviously, it is the Olympics year and India is a big country and everyone expects gold always. My focus is to just stay healthy and concentrate on my technique. And yes, if I stay healthy everything will be good.\"\n\nNeeraj has often insisted that consistency is one of his strong points. \"Maybe it is my greatest weapon. I will throw over 90, but consistency is more important for me,\" he reiterated. Nothing sums up that consistency more than this stat: The 87.58m he threw in Tokyo for the historic gold doesn't even feature in his top 10 throws anymore. Only twice in 2023 (shortly after his World Championships gold) and once in 2022 (in horrid conditions) he dipped below that. Since Tokyo alone, Neeraj has crossed 88m 10 times and three of those have been 89m+.\n\nIt is that consistency he will be looking for in Doha as he returns to action after more than 7 months since his hard-fought gold medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games. At the press conference Neeraj joked that while his popularity has certainly risen since Tokyo, he is not at the same level as the cricketers like Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. Someone like Kohli is in action nearly round the year and has to take breaks to manage his workload but that is not the case with track and field events. Neeraj has had a lengthy offseason and competes around 7-8 events in a year at best.\n\nDuring winter sessions in Potchefstroom, South Africa Neeraj restarted working with Spencer Mackay, Head of Strength & Conditioning at Inspire Institute of Sport, in a bid to be in top shape. Then he shifted base to Turkey as he stepped up to throwing sessions. Through it all, he has to stick to carefully planned processes, all while being away from the spotlight.\n\n\"I have to tell this, sometimes people might think it is a fun life where I am spending all this time outside India but it is actually not. It's mostly a boring life. You train in the morning, eat, and then rest. Then have your evening training session, have dinner, and then go to sleep. This is our daily routine. For example, we were in South Africa for 2-3 months. At one point we had not left the centre for four weeks. There is a line you can draw between the hostel, the dining hall and training area... that is the map we live in most times,\" Neeraj said in a press interaction a few weeks back.\n\nAs he gets closer to competition time, the winning itch will return. In Doha, the world will get a look at where Neeraj stands at the start of an Olympic year but he too will know what some of his main competitors have been up to. And to add to the occasion, he will have Kishore Kumar Jena too with him. Seeing more Indians compete at Diamond League meets has long been on Neeraj's wishlist and Jena, who gave the champion athlete a good old scare in Hangzhou, will be looking to make his mark too. Neeraj even said lightheartedly that the world has been asking him about the 90m mark, maybe Jena will get to that before him in Doha.\n\nBut true to his word, Neeraj's eyes will be trained on the runway, just trying to do what he has done best in his career: trust his training, step up, and deliver his best. The 90m will eventually be just happenstance, a byproduct of the work he puts in during all the months of training, not the main target.\n\nWhat's the field at Doha DL?\n\nMax Dehning, the 19-year-old German teenager who caused a stir earlier this year by throwing 90.20m, is not part of the field in Doha but has certainly caught Neeraj Chopra's attention too. They are set to meet later at Paavo Nurmi Games. There will be no German presence in Doha, and Neeraj's closest contender will be Jakub Vadlejch once again. The Czech athlete has travelled along with Neeraj to a majority of events, and he has started off the season in good form with a 87.00m throw in South Africa. From an Indian point of view, Kishore Kumar Jena's presence adds more interest to the Doha DL meet. The last time he competed, he briefly overtook Neeraj at the Hangzhou Asian Games final, and got up to 87.54m. The other names to look forward to would be Anderson Peters and Julius Yego, who have both crossed 90m in their careers. Peters, two-time World Champion, struggled for most of 2023 after his accident late in 2022. Yego, the 2016 Olympic silver medallist, is not the force he once was either. Finland's Oliver Helander, with a personal best of 89.83m, is another one to keep an eye on.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

India, your golden boy's coming home', shouts the joyful banner on the Inspire Institute of Sport's Instagram and X pages.\n\nClearly, everybody is thrilled that the Olympic champion will be competing at home after three years, in the Federation Nationals (National Federation senior athletics competition) which begin in Bhubaneswar on May 12, and that too in what promises to be a juicy duel with Kishore Kumar Jena, the No. 2 behind Neeraj in India's all-time javelin throw list, who almost beat him to the Asian Games gold in Hangzhou last year.\n\nWorld champion Neeraj will be opening his season in the Diamond League in Doha on Friday but Kashinath Naik, the country's first Commonwealth Games javelin throw medallist (New Delhi 2010, bronze) feels that it could be risky if the World champion competes in two meets so close to each other.\n\n\"Competing in Doha and then coming here to take part in the Federation Nationals is not good for him and that too at two venues so far away... it's not good. It will be okay if he competes in any one competition,\" said Kashinath, who was a part of the team which coached Neeraj during his early years, in a chat with Sportstar on Wednesday night.\n\nALSO READ | Neeraj Chopra to kick off Olympic defence at Doha Diamond League 2024\n\n\"But I hear he is not taking part in Doha, only Kishore Jena is competing there.\" That came as a shock.\n\nHowever, Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla said Neeraj will be competing in Doha. \"As per my knowledge, yes he is participating. I have not heard otherwise,\" Sumariwalla told Sportstar on Thursday. He also confirmed that Neeraj, the current World No. 1, will be competing in the Federation Nationals too.\n\nWhile the javelin competition in Doha is on the night of May 10, the qualification round at the Bhubaneswar Federation Nationals will be in the morning on May 14 with the final the next day.\n\nKashinath feels that Neeraj will be throwing 88m-plus in his season-opener. \"And if Jena throws more than 84m, it will be good,\" he said. Jena, who was fifth at last year's Budapest World Championships, produced a personal best 87.54 while taking the Hangzhou Asian Games silver behind Neeraj. Is there a chance that he could trouble Neeraj again in the season-opener?\n\n\"I don't think it is possible for Jena to beat Neeraj now...Neeraj has a lot of experience. Last year, he (Jena) threw 87m but after that in the National Games (in Goa) he threw only 78m,\" said Kashinath. But the duel promises to set the stage on fire.\n\nLatest on SportstarSri Lanka T20 World Cup 2024 squad: Mathews named in Hasaranga-led 15-member squadTeam SportstarPBKS vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2024:

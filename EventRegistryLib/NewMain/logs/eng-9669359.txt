This is a tragedy but it's not a crime.\"\n\nNelson had responded to reports of a man throwing things at cars, kicking walls and banging on windows in a shopping area in Auburn, a city of around 70,000 about 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of Seattle. Callers said the man appeared to be high or having mental health issues, Eakes said.\n\nInstead of waiting for backup and taking time to deescalate the situation, Nelson used force, Eakes said.\n\nWhen Nelson told Sarey he was under arrest for disorderly conduct and Sarey refused to put his hands behind his back, Nelson tried to take Sarey down with a hip-throw and then punched him seven times, Eakes said. Nelson pinned him against the wall, pulled out his gun and shot him in the stomach, she said.\n\nThe confrontation and shooting were captured on surveillance video, which the jury saw. It showed Nelson clearing a jammed round out of his gun after the first shot, looking around, then turning back to Sarey and firing again, this time into Sarey's forehead. The second shot came less than four seconds after the first, Eakes noted.\n\nShe quoted testimony from Steven Woodard, a witness, saying that after the first shot, Sarey \"was on the ground dying. There was no fight. He was done.\"\n\nOfficers are trained that a person can still be a threat even after being shot multiple times, defense attorney Murray said. Sarey continued to move after the first shot, and Nelson believed his life was in danger, she said.\n\n\"Officers get to defend themselves,\" she said. \"Police have been killed by their own guns. When Mr. Sarey went for Officer Nelson's gun, he escalated it to a lethal encounter.\"\n\nNelson did not testify during the trial.\n\nThe city of Auburn settled a civil rights claim by Sarey\u00b4s family for $4 million and has paid nearly $2 million more to settle other litigation over Nelson\u00b4s actions as a police officer.\n\nAn image of Jesse Sarey is displayed during closing arguments at Maleng Regional Justice Center in Kent, Wash., Thursday, June 20, 2024.

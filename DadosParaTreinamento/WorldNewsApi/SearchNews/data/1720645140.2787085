Cannon had been on a self-imposed exile after making his U21 debut in March of last year amid fears he would answer a call from his native England but last week Cannon said that while the FA did approach his agent to assess his interest in declaring for England, he was never going to be lured away from an Ireland set up which he joined for the first time at U19 level in 2019. He also stated that his absences from U21 and senior camps was down to injury and fitness issues. However, as Cannon is now over 21, an appearance at senior level in Portugal next week would formally tie him to Ireland with no chance of a defection to England, as happened with Declan Rice, \"There is every chance,\u201d O\u2019Shea said today at the team\u2019s base in Porto when asked if Cannon merited a run-out in Aveiro on Tuesday night, Portugal\u2019s final game before Euro 2024. \u201cHe has been very impressive but it's about understanding roles and responsibilities of what's needed for the team and when. But I can only speak very highly in admiration of what he's been able to do in training and he's going to be a good player for Ireland, a very good player.\u201d With Mark Travers available after missing the Hungary tie because it clashed with his wedding, O\u2019Shea has a full squad to select from, as Bosun Lawal dropped back to the U21s. \"Shane Duffy was a bit of a worry, he got a knock on his calf, thankfully he has been ok,\u201d O\u2019Shea added. \u201cBosun Lawal went to the U21s, which was good, he got through it, Andy [Moran and Josh [Keely] as well, Jim and his staff and players got a great result in Croatia. The rest are all fit, same squad as Tuesday ready to go, bar Bosun. Finn Azaz had a bang on the quad but is ok, he trained, Duffs was going to take it easy today but it was a light session so he took part.\u201d Portugal play Croatia in Germany in a friendly on Saturday evening and hope to have a sold out crowd of 32,000 for the game with Ireland in Aveiro on Tuesday.", "summary": "<p>John O\u2019Shea has hinted at a senior debut for Leicester City striker Tom Cannon in Tuesday\u2019s friendly away to Portugal \u2013 which would formally tie the attacker to Ireland \u2013 after he won over O\u2019Shea and his coaching staff in his first senior camp.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/hes-going-to-be-a-very-good-player-for-ireland-john-oshea-says-tom-cannon-lined-up-for-senior-debut-against-portugal/a1371654889.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/QTTcRj4d9kxlBhTfOMtGnU972HI=/0x145:2363x1723/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/ee5fe639-609f-4e83-9404-b7c6390b877e/4f975cab-a547-4a96-9300-9d95115ceca6/ee5fe639-609f-4e83-9404-b7c6390b877e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:55:41", "author": "Aidan Fitzmaurice", "authors": ["Aidan Fitzmaurice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.107}

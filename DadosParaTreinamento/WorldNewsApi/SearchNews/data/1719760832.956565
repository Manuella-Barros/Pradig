The video of Boston 25 News anchor Vanessa Welch appears to show a black object hover in the corner of her right eye before it falls into her mouth. Welch takes it in stride, appears to swallow whatever it was, and just keeps going. Video of the incident was posted on popular Instagram meme page @memezar. The video of Welch there has over 255,000 likes. Along with being impressed by Welch\u2019s stoicism, commenters said they hoped what actually fell into her mouth was an eyelash, not a fly. \u201cLooks more like she is wearing individual strip lashes (like lashify) and one of them has detached and come off while blinking,\u201d one Instagram user wrote. \u201cI have NEVER seen that level of professionalism DAMN,\u201d another person commented. Boston.com reached out to Welch about the incident.

That was shortly after leaving Juventus following eight highly successful years with the Bianconeri as CEO and director general. Oaktree also appointed six new members to the club's board of directors at a shareholders' meeting in Milan.\n\n\"I would like to thank Oaktree for the trust they have shown in giving me this opportunity to work alongside them and the board,\" Marotta said in a statement. \"This appointment is an acknowledgement of the fantastic work of the many people who have run the club over the last three years. I am proud to be part of Inter and remain committed as ever to the club.\"\n\nMarotta's moves in the transfer market were key to Juventus winning seven straight Serie A titles during his tenure, as well as a number of other trophies and reaching two Champions League finals. Inter has won five trophies, including two Serie A titles, during Marotta's time at the club.\n\nOaktree officially took over Inter on 22 May -- just three days after the Nerazzurri were presented with the Serie A trophy -- after previous owner Suning failed to meet a deadline of repaying a debt of nearly 400 million euros ($434 million), stemming from a three-year loan. The American fund now owns 99.6% of Inter, with the rest belonging to minor shareholders.\n\n\"Our goal is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the club by focusing on stable operational and financial management and sustainable growth,\" new board member Alejandro Cano said in his opening speech at the shareholders meeting, as representative for Oaktree.\n\n\"In this sense, the last few years of great victories provide us with a solid foundation. This AGM is the starting point for a new program of work.\"\n\nAlmost all the members of the previous board of directors and former president Steven Zhang have been replaced, with Marotta, Alessandro Antonello, Amedeo Carassai and Carlo Marchetti remaining.\n\n\"As new members of the board of directors of Inter, we understand our responsibility to Inter's community and legacy,\" Oaktree said in a statement. \"As president, Marotta will provide strong continuity to the club, as well as experience, passion and dedication from a distinguished career in football.\n\n\"The board looks forward to supporting the president and Inter's management team in ensuring the club is positioned for continued success on and off the field.\"\n\nAs well as Cano, who is Managing Director and Co-Head of Europe for Oaktree's Global Opportunities strategy, Katherine Ralph, Renato Meduri, Carlo Ligori, Delphine Nannan and Fausto Zanetton are the new appointees that will make up the rest of the 10-strong board.\n\n\"The new board brings together expertise from across Italy and Europe, including the Oaktree team who have partnered with the club since 2021,\" Inter's statement read.\n\nInter are the eighth Serie A club under American ownership.

for the trust they have shown in giving me this opportunity to work alongside them and the board,\" said Marotta in a statement.\n\nOaktree took control of Inter last month, days after the club were officially crowned kings of Italy for the 20th time, when previous owners Suning failed to repay a three-year loan which matured at 395 million euros ($428 million).\n\nThe US investment fund appointed six of its people to the Inter board alongside Marotta, who keeps the role as sporting CEO for which he was hired by Chinese conglomerate Suning and Zhang in 2018.\n\nCorporate CEO Alessandro Antonello has maintained his position on the board along with two other \"independent directors\" kept on from the Suning era.\n\nSince Marotta's arrival Inter have won two Serie A titles, two Italian Cups, three Italian Super Cups and reached the final of both the Champions League and Europa League.\n\nThe 67-year-old was previously CEO at Juventus for a trophy-laden eight years.\n\nOaktree, who manage $192 billion of assets, have repeatedly said that that they want operational and financial stability for Inter whose accounts are heading in the right direction after years of heavy losses exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThat means keeping on Marotta and Antonello and also coach Simone Inzaghi, whose Inter team secured the Serie A title with five matches to spare by winning a thrilling derby with local rivals AC Milan.\n\nInzaghi is expected to sign a contract extension until 2027 while new deals for captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are also being discussed.\n\n\"We have great confidence in the club's management team, and today's appointments fully confirm this,\" said Alejandro Cano, Oaktree's managing director for Europe and new Inter board member.\n\nInter are also working on a new stadium project in Milan suburb Rozzano, which Antonello has said is the club's priority despite talks with AC Milan and Milan city council over potentially taking possession of a renovated version of the current San Siro.\n\nItalian construction group WeBuild is working on a feasibility study for a renovation to be finished this month which the city of Milan hopes can convince its two world famous football clubs to stay within its borders.\n\nMayor of Milan Giuseppe Sala has repeatedly expressed worry about what will happen to the San Siro if both teams leave, with AC Milan having bought land in suburb San Donato Milanese for their own stadium project.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The change comes as part of a broader restructuring following the recent acquisition by US investment firm Oaktree, who took control of the club last month.\n\nMarotta, widely credited as the mastermind behind Inter's resurgence in European football, will succeed outgoing president, Steven Zhang. The appointment is scheduled to be formalised at a shareholders' meeting in Milan later on Tuesday, where a new board will also be instated. This transition follows Oaktree's takeover, which occurred just days after Inter claimed their 20th Serie A title when previous owners Suning failed to repay a substantial \u20ac395 million (\u00a3336 million) loan.\n\nMarotta expressed his gratitude in a statement that read in part: \"I would like to thank Oaktree for the trust they have shown in giving me this opportunity to work alongside them and the Board.\" He further added, \"This appointment is an acknowledgement of the fantastic work of the many people who have run the Club over the last three years.\"\n\nSince joining Inter in 2018 as head of football operations under Suning and Zhang, Marotta's tenure has been marked by remarkable success. Under his leadership, the Nerazzurri have clinched two Serie A titles, two Italian Cups, and three Italian Super Cups. Moreover, they have reached the pinnacle of European competition, contesting the finals of both the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.\n\nThe 67-year-old executive brings a wealth of experience to his new role.

Inter has won five trophies, including two Serie A titles, during Marotta's time at the club.\n\nOaktree officially took over Inter on May 22 -- just three days after the Nerazzurri were presented with the Serie A trophy -- after previous owner Suning failed to meet a deadline of repaying a debt of nearly 400 million euros ($434 million), stemming from a three-year loan.\n\nThe American fund now owns 99.6% of Inter, with the rest belonging to minor shareholders.\n\n\"Our goal is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the club by focusing on stable operational and financial management and sustainable growth,\" new board member Alejandro Cano said in his opening speech at the shareholders meeting, as representative for Oaktree.\n\n\"In this sense, the last few years of great victories provide us with a solid foundation. This AGM is the starting point for a new program of work.\"\n\nAlmost all the members of the previous board of directors and former president Steven Zhang have been replaced, with Marotta, Alessandro Antonello, Amedeo Carassai and Carlo Marchetti remaining.\n\n\"As new members of the board of directors of Inter, we understand our responsibility to Inter's community and legacy,\" Oaktree said in a statement. \"As president, Marotta will provide strong continuity to the club, as well as experience, passion and dedication from a distinguished career in football.\n\n\"The board looks forward to supporting the president and Inter's management team in ensuring the club is positioned for continued success on and off the field.\"\n\nAs well as Cano, who is Managing Director and Co-Head of Europe for Oaktree's Global Opportunities strategy, Katherine Ralph, Renato Meduri, Carlo Ligori, Delphine Nannan and Fausto Zanetton are the new appointees that will make up the rest of the 10-strong board.\n\n\"The new board brings together expertise from across Italy and Europe, including the Oaktree team who have partnered with the club since 2021,\" Inter's statement read.\n\nInter is the eighth Serie A club under American ownership. The others are AC Milan, Atalanta, Fiorentina, Roma, Genoa and newly-promoted teams Parma and Venezia.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Marotta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giuseppe Marotta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Kangyang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Kangyang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezia_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venezia F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Marchetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Marchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

"Inter Milan's sporting CEO Giuseppe Marotta was appointed the Serie A champions' new president on Tuesday following the recent takeover by new US owners Oaktree.\n\nMarotta, considered the architect of Inter's recent return to football's top table, has replaced former president Steven Zhang following a shareholders' meeting in Milan in which a new board was also appointed.\n\n\"I would like to thank Oaktree for the trust they have shown in giving me this opportunity to work alongside them and the board,\" said Marotta in a statement.\n\nOaktree took control of Inter last month, days after the club were officially crowned kings of Italy for the 20th time, when previous owners Suning failed to repay a three-year loan which matured at 395 million euros ($428 million).\n\nThe US investment fund appointed six of its people to the Inter board alongside Marotta, who keeps the role as sporting CEO for which he was hired by Chinese conglomerate Suning and Zhang in 2018.\n\nCorporate CEO Alessandro Antonello has maintained his position on the board along with two other \"independent directors\" kept on from the Suning era.\n\nSince Marotta's arrival Inter have won two Serie A titles, two Italian Cups, three Italian Super Cups and reached the final of both the Champions League and Europa League.\n\nThe 67-year-old was previously CEO at Juventus for a trophy-laden eight years.\n\n- New stadium project -\n\nOaktree, who manage $192 billion of assets, have repeatedly said that that they want operational and financial stability for Inter whose accounts are heading in the right direction after years of heavy losses exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThat means keeping on Marotta and Antonello and also coach Simone Inzaghi, whose Inter team secured the Serie A title with five matches to spare by winning a thrilling derby with local rivals AC Milan.\n\nInzaghi is expected to sign a contract extension until 2027 while new deals for captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are also being discussed.\n\n\"We have great confidence in the club's management team, and today's appointments fully confirm this,\" said Alejandro Cano, Oaktree's managing director for Europe and new Inter board member.\n\nInter are also working on a new stadium project in Milan suburb Rozzano, which Antonello has said is the club's priority despite talks with AC Milan and Milan city council over potentially taking possession of a renovated version of the current San Siro.\n\nItalian construction group WeBuild is working on a feasibility study for a renovation to be finished this month which the city of Milan hopes can convince its two world famous football clubs to stay within its borders.\n\nMayor of Milan Giuseppe Sala has repeatedly expressed worry about what will happen to the San Siro if both teams leave, with AC Milan having bought land in suburb San Donato Milanese for their own stadium project.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com",

Meanwhile, her attorney, Robert Julian, said Tuesday that she'll appeal the panel's determination.\n\nGall testified during the investigation, saying that the violent skirmishes at the graduation party triggered memories of a 1990 assault she suffered as a college student. Julian did not dispute his client's comments, but said she was in a \"state of fear, dismay, frustration and exhaustion\" when she made them.\n\nAccording to the report, Gall attended the party at a friend's home in New Hartford, New York with her husband and three teenage children. The party's hosts hired a bartender and provided a keg of beer that guests could serve themselves from.\n\nA large number of apparent party crashers showed up after 11:30 p.m., the panel said. Four Black teenagers arrived after learning of the party from a live video feed, and the driver then lost his car keys, the report said.\n\nArguments and fights broke out between invited and uninvited guests, and officers from several law enforcement agencies responded.\n\nPolice body camera footage showed Gall telling the Black teenagers, \"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property.\"\n\nShe then said, \"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening. That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nGall tried to get the police to arrest the Black teenagers for trespassing, saying, \"I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this.\"\n\nShe also yelled at the teenagers to \"Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a judge!,\" using a profanity.\n\nBoth Gall's husband and her 18-year-old son were involved in the fighting, and Gall told officers that her son \"put a smackdown once he got hit.\"\n\nShe also said, \"My husband and son got hit first . . . but they finished. Like I taught 'em.\"\n\nThe body camera footage shows that Gall alternated between complaining that the officers weren't arresting anyone and assuring officers that she was on their side.\n\n\"Listen, but guess what, the good part is - the good part is I'm always on your side,\" she said. \"You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nGall told police that the Black teenagers \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nShe also said that if the teenagers were to come back looking for their keys, \"you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nGall's behavior was \"as shocking as anything I have seen in my 40 years of judicial ethics enforcement,\" said Robert H.

The party included beer in a keg.\n\nIn meetings with the commission, Gall acknowledged her ethical lapses. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached immediately for comment. She has been a state supreme court justice since 2012.\n\nGall multiple times told responding police, who were trying to de-escalate the situation, that she was a judge. She tried to direct them to who should be arrested, despite what police saw as a lack of evidence, commission reports show. Her son was among those involved in fights, records say.\n\nWhen one officer told Gall that she wasn't even at her own home, she answered, \"It's my jurisdiction, though.\"\n\nThe interactions that are the foundation of the commission's decision were captured on police body-worn camera video.\n\nOut-of-line comments at a party: 'I'll shoot them'\n\nEncouraging police to arrest Black teens who were allegedly involved in some of the scuffles, she said: \"They don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\" She had informed the police that her son would be attending business school.\n\nGall also expected some Black teens to return to look for missing car keys and told police that \"when they trespass you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nAn officer pushed back, telling her: \"You can't shoot somebody for simply going on your property. ... Do you hear what you're saying? You're all white, privileged people with high-power jobs.\"\n\nWhen an officer told her that the police could face a civil rights lawsuit for questionable arrests, Gall said: \"The good part is I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nWhat 'Judge Gall' says about the party comments\n\nThe commission report also shows that Gall told teenagers to leave and catch an Uber home, saying: \"That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nIn meetings with the commission and a referee, Gall acknowledged that:\n\nGall told the commission that she reacted emotionally because both her son and husband, who she said tried to intervene, ended up involved in the fights.

Meanwhile, her attorney, Robert Julian, said Tuesday that she'll appeal the panel's determination.\n\nGall testified during the investigation, saying that the violent skirmishes at the graduation party triggered memories of a 1990 assault she suffered as a college student. Julian did not dispute his client's comments, but said she was in a \"state of fear, dismay, frustration and exhaustion\" when she made them.\n\nAccording to the report, Gall attended the party at a friend's home in New Hartford, New York, with her husband and three teenage children. The party's hosts hired a bartender and provided a keg of beer that guests could serve themselves from.\n\nA large number of apparent party crashers showed up after 11:30 p.m., the panel said. Four Black teenagers arrived after learning of the party from a live video feed, and the driver then lost his car keys, the report said.\n\nArguments and fights broke out between invited and uninvited guests, and officers from several law enforcement agencies responded.\n\nPolice body camera footage showed Gall telling the Black teenagers, \"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property.\"\n\nShe then said, \"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening. That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nGall tried to get the police to arrest the Black teenagers for trespassing, saying, \"I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this.\"\n\nShe also yelled at the teenagers to \"Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a judge!,\" using a profanity.\n\nBoth Gall's husband and her 18-year-old son were involved in the fighting, and Gall told officers that her son \"put a smackdown once he got hit.\"\n\nShe also said, \"My husband and son got hit first . . . but they finished. Like I taught 'em.\"\n\nIn a written response to the commission's report, Gail's lawyers wrote: \"The Respondent's son was slapped, hit, knocked to the ground, kicked in the head and body and beaten by four or more of the uninvited individuals. Her husband, in an attempt to rescue their son and stop the fight, began pulling teenagers off of the pile and was assaulted himself in the process. He sustained bruising and swelling to both ears and his shirt was torn.\"\n\nThe body camera footage shows that Gall alternated between complaining that the officers weren't arresting anyone and assuring officers that she was on their side.\n\n\"Listen, but guess what, the good part is - the good part is I'm always on your side,\" she said. \"You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nGall told police that the Black teenagers \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nShe also said that if the teenagers were to come back looking for their keys, \"you can shoot them on the property.

Gall of State Supreme Court in Oneida County, made the remarks to law enforcement officers after a high school graduation party she was at in July 2022 descended into verbal arguments and physical fights amid the arrival of a large number of uninvited guests, the state's Commission on Judicial Conduct said.\n\nThe officers' body-worn and dashboard cameras recorded Justice Gall's comments, and she acknowledged having made them. The commission found that impropriety had \"permeated\" her behavior on the night in question and that her \"wide array of misconduct severely undermined public confidence\" in \"her ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge.\"\n\n\"The judge's behavior in this case is as shocking as anything I have seen in my 40 years of judicial ethics enforcement,\" Robert H. Tembeckjian, the commission's administrator and counsel, said in a statement.\n\nJustice Gall, a Republican, was elected to the Supreme Court in 2011. Her 14-year-term is set to expire next year. She earns $232,600 a year and, the commission said, will be suspended with pay while the state's Court of Appeals decides her fate. She has 30 days to appeal the commission's determination to the court. Her lawyer, Robert Julian, said she planned to do so.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the determination,\" Mr. Julian said. While he did not dispute the comments at issue, he wrote in a filing with the commission that his client had been in a \"state of fear, dismay, frustration and exhaustion\" when she made them.\n\nThe events that prompted the commission's action began late on July 1, 2022, and spilled into the early hours of the next day, the commission said. Justice Gall, 53, her husband and their three teenage children were at the graduation party, at a friend's home in New Hartford, N.Y.\n\nThe hosts had hired a bartender for the evening and had bought a keg of beer that remained after the bartender left, the commission said. Justice Gall told commission investigators she had not consumed alcohol at the party.\n\nParty crashers began arriving at around 11:30 p.m., and before long, arguments and fights were breaking out, the commission said. Justice Gall's husband and 18-year-old son were among those involved in the altercations.\n\nShortly after midnight, four Black teenagers who had learned of the party from a friend showed up, and the fighting escalated, although it was unclear what role the four played, the commission said. The teenager who drove them there lost his car key in the fracas, the commission said.\n\nNew Hartford police officers, responding to calls about a large party with numerous fights, arrived at about 12:30 and were soon joined by officers from several other law enforcement agencies.\n\nAs the officers tried to clear the chaotic scene and the Black teenagers lingered while looking for the lost key, the commission said, Justice Gall, who is white, told them to \"get off the property -- and that's from Judge Gall.\" She added, with a vulgarity included for emphasis: \"I'm a judge.\"\n\nMinutes later, she cited her judicial status again.\n\n\"You're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home,\" she said, adding: \"That's how I roll. That how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\" Over roughly an hour and a half, she invoked her office more than a dozen times, the commission said.\n\nAn officer suggested to her that if someone found the missing key, it should be returned to the police. Otherwise, the officer said, someone from the group that lost it would need to return to look for it further.\n\n\"If they come back looking for it, I'll call you while they're on the property,\" Justice Gall said, adding: \"If they did, they'll be arrested, or they'll be shot on the property.

Gall's tenure on the bench after it investigated how she behaved after uninvited guests arrived at the party in New Hartford. Police were summoned to navigate the dispute, and much of the confrontation was recorded on police body cameras and dashboard cameras, the commission wrote in a report issued on Monday.\n\n\"Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a f__ing judge!\" Gall is accused of telling the teens.\n\n\"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening,\" the Utica-based justice said. \"That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\"\n\nThe commission - which on Monday posted copious video footage from the scene - said the judge's comments were aimed at Black teens who were among groups of uninvited people who arrived at the party. The judge's husband and son \"participated in the escalating arguments.\"\n\n\"When a group of four Black teens arrived at the party, having received a text message with the address, physical fighting broke out, in the course of which the key to the teens' car was lost,\" the commission's report states.\n\nFive different police agencies were called to quell the dispute. Police repeatedly said the teens would leave after they found the dropped key.\n\nGall told the police that if the Black teens returned to the property to look for the keys she would \"shoot them on the property,\" the report said. She allegedly added that the teens did not look \"that smart\" and were \"not going to business school, that's for sure.\" (The judge's son was at the time headed to business school.)\n\nHere's video of police interacting with Gall.\n\nThe commission said she went on to tell the police she would \"take anyone down for you guys. You know that. You know that. You know I am on your side,\" and made disparaging remarks about Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which are used to keep firearms away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nDuring the lengthy diatribe, the commission said Gall invoked her judicial office a dozen times.\n\nIt will now be up to the Court of Appeals to decide whether to follow through on the commission's recommendation that Gall be removed, the harshest punishment a judge can face for misconduct. If the state's top court orders her removal, Gall has 30 days to request a full review of the commission's investigation.\n\nIn recommending the judge's removal, the commission wrote: \"Instead of leaving the chaotic situation, for over an hour, respondent repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the rules (governing judicial conduct). Her wide array of misconduct severely undermined public confidence in the judiciary and in her ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge.\"\n\nIn response to the commission's findings, Gall, through her lawyer, \"proposed that a sanction less than removal be imposed,\" the report states.\n\nThe commission wrote that Gall defended herself, saying she was acting as a mother and wife who had seen her loved ones attacked, is \"honest, respectful and conscientious\" on the bench, and that her conduct at the party was triggered by \"extreme emotional distress\" triggered by memories of a 1990 assault.\n\n\"Judge Gall has been remorseful, apologetic, and accepting of responsibility. She acknowledged from the very beginning that she was embarrassed by her conduct and humiliated at the way in which she reacted to the unforeseen events that had occurred,\" her lawyer, Robert F. Julian, wrote in a brief included among the items released by the commission. \"It is the opinion of her psychologists that her conduct was secondary to a trauma reaction which we offer not as an excuse but as an explanation.\"\n\nGall first took office in 2012. Her current term ends in 2025. A lawyer since 1997, she's paid $232,600 a year.\n\nShe could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian said in a statement that accompanied the report. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\n\n\"That all this and more was committed by one judge disqualifies her from further service on the bench.\"", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_goodwin@star-telegram.com", "name": "Mike Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Julian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Gall seen on police body cam footage in July 2022. (Screenshot from the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct/YouTube)\n\nA judge in Oneida County, New York, should be removed from the bench for \"truly egregious\" misconduct during a July 2022 high school graduation party outside a friend's home, according to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.\n\nJudge Erin P. Gall, a judge on New York's trial-level supreme court, attended the party with her husband and then-18-year-old son. According to a July 22 press release, the commission determined that Gall engaged \"in a racially offensive, profane, prolonged public diatribe\" in which \"she repeatedly invoked her judicial office, threatened gun violence, and both criticized and pledged favored treatment for the police.\"\n\n\"Impropriety permeated respondent's conduct\" at the party, the judicial conduct commission said in a July 17 determination made public Monday.\n\nGall has 30 days to seek review of the determination before the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. Her lawyer, Robert Julian, told the New York Times that she will appeal.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the determination,\" Julian said.\n\nThe problems began after several people thought to be uninvited guests arrived at the party sometime after 11 p.m., and one of them overturned a tray of food. People were talking loudly, some using vulgarities, and confrontations were escalating. Gall's husband and then-18-year-old son began shepherding guests away from a tent and to the street. At some point, Gall's son was slapped and brought to the ground. Gall said the youth was kicked, stomped on and punched.\n\nNew Hartford, New York, police arrived after midnight. Gall identified herself as a judge and did the same when she screamed at four Black teenagers looking for lost car keys.\n\n\"You got to leave!\" Gall said in comments caught on video. \"You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property. That's what I'm saying. No. Done. You're done. Done, done, done. Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a f- - -ing judge! And I'm telling you! Get off the f- - -ing property!\"\n\nLater, Gall, who is white, told police that the Black teens should be arrested.\n\n\"They were trespassing, and ... they should be arrested,\" Gall said on police body cam video. \"Come on. This is not my first rodeo. Are you from New Hartford? OK, New Hartford police: They should either be arrested or driven off the property. We shouldn't be looking for their keys. They assaulted people here. We're not pressing charges. We just need them gone. I don't know if I have to call the chief of police. This is ridiculous.\"\n\nWhen a police officer told Gall that they could \"end up in front of your court\" for violating the teens' civil rights, Gall replied, \"Listen, but guess what, the good part is -- the good part is I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that. You know that. You know I am on your side.\"\n\nShe also said her son had been attacked first, but his attackers got the worst end of it because \"I taught my son to kick the s- - - out of anyone who hits him first.\" She also said her son would be going to business school in the fall, whereas the four Black teens \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nAn officer suggested that the best outcome would be for someone to find the keys and return them, so the teens would not have to come back and look for them.\n\nGall responded that she would call the police if the teens return.\n\n\"They'll be arrested, or they'll be shot on the property,\" she said. \"Because when they trespass, you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nAt an ethics hearing, Gall said she was emotionally distraught after seeing her son and husband caught up in the fighting, and she regretted her actions. She also said her overreaction was triggered by an assault that she endured in 1990 while she was an 18-year-old freshman at Boston College.\n\nThe conduct commission said it was sympathetic to Gall's past trauma, but it does not excuse her \"significant misconduct.\"\n\nGall \"irreparably damaged her integrity by repeatedly invoking her judicial office and forfeited her ability to be and to appear to be impartial, particularly as it relates to race and law enforcement personnel,\" the commission said in its determination. \"Given the range of her misconduct, members of the public can have no confidence in her ability to preside in a fair and unbiased manner.\"\n\nIn a statement, Robert H. Tembeckjian, the commission's administrator, said it is \"utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice\" and \"promise favorable treatment for the police.\"\n\nGall's lawyer did not immediately respond to the ABA Journal's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "abajournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABA Journal - Law News Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debra_cassens_weiss@abajournal.com", "name": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Commission_on_Judicial_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Bar Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.abajournal.com/images/main_images/Judge_Erin_Gall_screenshot_800px.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 544}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 914, "textEnd": 921}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

The party included beer in a keg. In meetings with the commission, Gall acknowledged her ethical lapses. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached immediately for comment. She has been a state supreme court justice since 2012.\n\nGall multiple times told responding police, who were trying to de-escalate the situation, that she was a judge. She tried to direct them to who should be arrested, despite what police saw as a lack of evidence, commission reports show. Her son was among those involved in fights, records say.\n\nWhen one officer told Gall that she wasn't even at her own home, she answered, \"It's my jurisdiction, though.\"\n\nThe interactions that are the foundation of the commission's decision were captured on police body-worn camera video.\n\nEncouraging police to arrest Black teens who were allegedly involved in some of the scuffles, she said: \"They don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\" She had informed the police that her son would be attending business school.\n\nGall also expected some Black teens to return to look for missing car keys and told police that \"when they trespass you can shoot them on the property.

You're all white, privileged people with high-power jobs.\"\n\nWhen an officer told her that the police could face a civil rights lawsuit for questionable arrests, Gall said: \"The good part is I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nThe commission report also shows that Gall told teenagers to leave and catch an Uber home, saying: \"That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nIn meetings with the commission and a referee, Gall acknowledged that:\n\nGall told the commission that she reacted emotionally because both her son and husband, who she said tried to intervene, ended up involved in the fights. She said she also was frustrated because she thought the police response was inadequate.\n\nGall said she was assaulted when a college student in 1990 and the graduation melee reminded her of that assault and triggered an extreme emotional response.\n\nThe commission, however, found her transgressions severe enough to warrant removal.\n\nGall \"repeatedly violated the ethical rule prohibiting judges from lending the prestige of their judicial office to advance their own private interests or the interests of others,\" the commission determined.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Commission Administrator Robert Tembeckjian said in a statement. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\"\n\nGall has been a Justice of the Supreme Court, Fifth Judicial District, since 2012.

Gall allegedly invoked her judicial role, and questioned the intelligence of the teens during a diatribe at graduation party\n\nALBANY -- A state Supreme Court justice faces removal from the bench after she allegedly threatened to shoot Black teens, insulted their intelligence and repeatedly invoked her job as a judge during a July 2, 2022 diatribe at a graduation party hosted by a friend.\n\nThe state's Commission on Judicial Conduct urged the Court of Appeals to end Justice Erin P. Gall's tenure on the bench after it investigated how she behaved after uninvited guests arrived at the party in New Hartford. Police were summoned to navigate the dispute and much of the confrontation was recorded on police body cameras and dashboard cameras, the commission wrote in a report issued on Monday.\n\n\"...Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a [f------] judge!\" Gall is accused of telling the teens.\n\n\"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening,\" the Utica-based justice said. \"That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\"\n\nThe commission said the judge's comments were aimed at Black teens who were among groups of uninvited people who arrived at the party. The judge's husband and son \"participated in the escalating arguments.\"\n\n\"When a group of four Black teens arrived at the party, having received a text message with the address, physical fighting broke out, in the course of\n\nwhich the key to the teens' car was lost,\" the commission's report states.\n\nFive different police agencies were called to quell the dispute. Police repeatedly said the teens would leave after they found the dropped keys.\n\nGall told the police that if the Black teens returned to the property to look for the keys she would \"shoot them on the property,\" the report said. She allegedly added that the teens did not look \"that smart\" and were \"not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nThe commission said she went on to tell the police she would \"take anyone down for you guys. You know that. You know that. You know I am on your side\" and made disparaging remarks about Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which are used to keep firearms away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nDuring the lengthy diatribe, the commission said Gall invoked her judicial office a dozen times.\n\nIt will now be up to the Court of Appeals to decide whether to follow through on the commission's recommendation that Gall be removed, the harshest punishment a judge can face for misconduct. If the state's top court orders her removal, Gall has 30 days to request a full review of the commission's investigation.\n\nIn recommending the judge's removal, the commission wrote: \"Instead of leaving the chaotic situation, for over an hour, respondent repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the rules [governing judicial conduct]. Her wide array of misconduct severely undermined public confidence in the judiciary and in her ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge.\"\n\nIn response to the commission's findings, Gall, through her lawyer, \"proposed that a sanction less than removal be imposed,\" the report states.\n\nThe commission wrote that Gall defended herself, saying she was acting as a mother and wife who had seen her loved ones attacked, is \" honest, respectful and conscientious\" on the bench, and that her conduct at the party was triggered by \"extreme emotional distress triggered\" by memories of a 1990 assault.\n\nGall first took office in 2012. Her current term ends in 2025. A lawyer since 1997, she's paid 232,600 a year.\n\nGall could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian said in a statement that accompanied the report. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\n\n\"That all this and more was committed by one judge disqualifies her from further service on the bench.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesunion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Union"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Young_Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Young Writers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/03/60/03/17760481/14/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Her wide array of misconduct severely undermined public confidence in the judiciary and in her ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge,\" the commission wrote in their report.\n\nThe incident took place on July 1, 2022, at a friend's home in New Hartford, New York. Gall attended with her husband and three teenage children. A fight broke out involving uninvited guests, including several Black teenagers. According to the commission's findings, Gall, a white Republican who has served in Oneida County since 2012, used her judicial authority inappropriately, attempting to have the teenagers arrested, threatening violence, and making racially insensitive comments.\n\n\"When a group of four Black teens arrived at the party, having received a text message with the address, physical fighting broke out, in the course of which the key to the teens' car was lost,\" the commission's report states.\n\nFive police agencies were then called to end the dispute.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct via email for comment.\n\nThe commission also shared various video footage from the scene that captured Gall's remarks, where she can be heard telling the teenagers, \"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property.\" She also boasted about her judicial position, saying, \"That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\" Adding, \"I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this.\"\n\nThe situation then escalated as Gall attempted to have the teenagers arrested for trespassing, using her status to pressure law enforcement officers. According to the report, Gall made several derogatory remarks, including suggesting that the teenagers \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure,\" and then stated that if they returned, \"you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nHowever, in response Gall's attorney, Robert Julian, \"proposed that a sanction less than removal be imposed,\" the commission report states.\n\nIn addition, Gall said she intends to appeal the commission's decision, arguing that her actions were influenced by a traumatic assault she experienced in 1990, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Judge Gall has been remorseful, apologetic and accepting of responsibility. She acknowledged from the very beginning that she was embarrassed by her conduct and humiliated at the way in which she reacted to the unforeseen events that had occurred,\" Julian wrote in a brief included among the items released by the commission. \"It is the opinion of her psychologists that her conduct was secondary to a trauma reaction, which we offer not as an excuse but as an explanation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian condemned Galls' actions in a statement that accompanied the report.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Tembeckjian said. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\"\n\nGall, who earns an annual salary of $232,600 and whose current term ends in 2025, is currently suspended with pay while the New York Court of Appeals decides her fate, the AP reports.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Commission_on_Judicial_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2435147/new-york-court-building.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=1db98affe6b40a3efa26c2b2135eddb7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Gall - a justice for the Fifth Judicial District based in Oneida County - was suspended with pay after the New York Commission on Judicial Conduct ruled that she should be removed after an inappropriate interaction with police and civilians at the party.\n\nThe commission ruled that she tried to use her position as a judge to influence police, demonstrated racial bias and bias in favor of law enforcement.\n\nPolice body camera footage from the party, the commission said, showed her threatening to shoot a group of black teens if they returned to her friend's property and threatening to speak to officers' supervisors as a judge when they did not do as she suggested. She also bragged to a police officer that she taught her son to beat others up if they attacked him, the commission said.\n\nThe commission made its ruling on Wednesday and made it public Monday.\n\nGall has 30 days to appeal the commission's decision or she will be removed.\n\nSyracuse.com | The Post Standard called Gall's chambers and contacted her attorney. Neither was immediately available for comment.\n\nGall was elected to the judge's position in 2011. She ran as a Republican. Her current 14-year term is set to expire in December 2025. Voters from across Central New York voted for her. Her salary is $232,600.\n\nOn July 2, 2022, Gall participated in a \"racially offensive, profane, prolonged public diatribe outside a high school graduation party,\" according to a news release from the commission.\n\nGall was a guest at a high school graduation party in the town of New Hartford that was slowly growing out of control. Large groups of people were showing up uninvited after word got out about the party.\n\nSometime after 11:30 p.m., a group of four Black teens arrived at the party after seeing the address posted on social media. After the teens arrived, physical fights began to break out among people at the party.\n\nTwo of the teens and Gall's son were found to have been involved in the fights but it was unclear how the fight began, the commission said.\n\nPolice were called and Gall - despite not being the host of the party - took it upon herself to speak to officers and inform them repeatedly that she was a judge, the commission said.\n\nWhen police arrived, it was clear many underage people were drinking. Gall denied drinking and said that she was sober for the entirety of the party.\n\nOver an approximately 80-minute interaction with police, she invoked her position as a judge over a dozen times and made statements that were racially insensitive and others that demonstrated a bias toward law enforcement at the detriment of civil rights.\n\nBody camera footage from officers on scene showed, according to the commission, Gall making the following statements to police and the group of black teens:\n\nDays after the party, Gall spoke with law enforcement officers inside the Oneida County Courthouse and expressed her dissatisfaction with how the officers on scene handled the situation. The commission ruled that this conversation showed Gall did not recognize the severity of her actions that night.\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made to the commission which spurred the investigation and disciplinary process.\n\nDuring that process, Gall admitted that her actions demonstrated the appearance of seeking preferential treatment as a result of her position, racial bias and bias in favor of law enforcement, the commission said.\n\nGall said that she reacted as a mother and a wife who saw her loved ones in a fight and said she regretted her actions. Despite admitting her mistakes she maintained that her actions should be punished with a censure rather than her removal from office.\n\nIn the end, the commission found that \"impropriety permeated respondent's conduct\" and her choices \"irreparably damaged her ability to serve as a judge,\" according to the commission's determination.\n\nIn 46 years, the commission has issued 184 determinations of removal. The Court of Appeals has reduced 10 determinations of removal to either a censure or an admonition but has never dismissed a sanction that began as a request for removal.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post-Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Post-Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/NTNJY2QGUNE3LLOICA62HZTJCY.JPG?auth=3edba81069934e9e6bcb5367bd0272fbef0028d118a56d6d61965c6729f2fa3d&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

I'll shoot them on the property,\" the panel said.\n\nOne officer apparently pushed back on the suggestion, referring to Gall as \"lady\" and \"ma'am,\" and saying, \"This isn't Texas. You can't shoot somebody for simply going on your property. . . . Do you hear what you're saying? You're all White, privileged people with high-power jobs.\"\n\nGall, the panel said, was not pleased the officer didn't call her judge.\n\n\"Don't call me 'Lady.' 'Judge.' It's 'Judge,'\" documents said. \"You guys didn't really do much.\"\n\n\"If you're not invited by a homeowner, it's still trespassing. I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this,\" Gall also said, according to the panel.\n\nGall, the documents said, was also heard screaming at the teens while repeatedly identifying herself as a judge.\n\n\"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property. That's what I'm saying. No. Done. You're done. Done, done, done. Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a f -- ing judge!\" the panel recounted her words. \"And I'm telling you! Get off the f -- ing property! No, judge. It's judge. I could give a f -- . . . . I don't want anyone on the property. If I have to clear it out, I will.\"\n\n\"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening. That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll,\" the panel further quoted Gall. \"That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\"\n\nOne panelist, Colgate University Professor Nina Moore, wrote a concurrence (which one other member joined), saying that Gall acknowledged her remarks that the Black teens didn't look smart and didn't have a business school in their futures at minimum created an appearance of racial bias. But Moore went much further, writing that Gall's \"that's how I roll\" words were a \"mocking blaccent.\"\n\nMoore also doubted Gall's claim that being an assault survivor triggered her more than 30 years later in a \"racialized\" way.\n\nBlack litigants, attorneys, court staff and others who enter a New York state courtroom are entitled to equal justice. They should not have to carry the additional burden of wondering whether their matters will be adjudicated by a judge of sound and sober mind, or a traumatized judge with a proclivity toward racial stereotyping and racially tainted directives. Inexplicably, respondent's 1990 trauma took the form of racialized behavior on July 2, 2022. Her derisive deployment of Black English (aka \"African American vernacular,\" \"Ebonics,\" and \"blaccent\") is jolting.\n\n[...]\n\nJudge Gall's mocking blaccent is in addition to the other racialized behaviors noted in the majority opinion, including her assessment of the four Black male teenagers as less than Business School material and the hint that they could not afford cocaine -- reflexive assessments that she made with no personal knowledge whatsoever of the four Black teens. The defense argument that the teens' behavior was distinctive and merited such harsh judgement is belied by the fact that Judge Gall's own husband and son had, in her words, just given someone a \"smack down,\" and at her friend's party where police officers observed many teens had been drinking or were intoxicated. Critically, respondent's words on the night of the incident did not pertain to behavior. They expressly targeted physical features. She stated: \"They don't look like they're that smart.\"\n\nThe panel as a whole concluded that Gall, rather than \"leaving the chaotic situation, for over an hour, [...] repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the Rules,\" conduct that was \"unbecoming a judge, brought reproach upon the judiciary and irreparably damaged her ability to serve as a judge.\"\n\nWhile the panel recommended removal from office, Gall's lawyer said she should at most be sanctioned.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The party included beer in a keg.\n\nIn meetings with the commission, Gall acknowledged her ethical lapses. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached immediately for comment. She has been a state supreme court justice since 2012.\n\nGall multiple times told responding police, who were trying to de-escalate the situation, that she was a judge. She tried to direct them to who should be arrested, despite what police saw as a lack of evidence, commission reports show. Her son was among those involved in fights, records say.\n\nWhen one officer told Gall that she wasn't even at her own home, she answered, \"It's my jurisdiction, though.\"\n\nThe interactions that are the foundation of the commission's decision were captured on police body-worn camera video.\n\nEncouraging police to arrest Black teens who were allegedly involved in some of the scuffles, she said: \"They don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\" She had informed the police that her son would be attending business school.\n\nGall also expected some Black teens to return to look for missing car keys and told police that \"when they trespass you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nAn officer pushed back, telling her: \"You can't shoot somebody for simply going on your property. ... Do you hear what you're saying? You're all white, privileged people with high-power jobs.\"\n\nWhen an officer told her that the police could face a civil rights lawsuit for questionable arrests, Gall said: \"The good part is I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nThe commission report also shows that Gall told teenagers to leave and catch an Uber home, saying: \"That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nIn meetings with the commission and a referee, Gall acknowledged that:\n\nGall told the commission that she reacted emotionally because both her son and husband, who she said tried to intervene, ended up involved in the fights. She said she also was frustrated because she thought the police response was inadequate.\n\nGall said she was assaulted when a college student in 1990 and the graduation melee reminded her of that assault and triggered an extreme emotional response.\n\nRead This: You voted to fight corruption in NY state. But dishonest officials kept hefty pensions\n\nThe commission, however, found her transgressions severe enough to warrant removal.\n\nGall \"repeatedly violated the ethical rule prohibiting judges from lending the prestige of their judicial office to advance their own private interests or the interests of others,\" the commission determined.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Commission Administrator Robert Tembeckjian said in a statement. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\"\n\nGall has been a Justice of the Supreme Court, Fifth Judicial District, since 2012. Her current term expires on Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nThe commission's determination that Gall be removed from her judgeship will go to the state Court of Appeals for a final determination.\n\n-- Gary Craig is a veteran reporter with the Democrat and Chronicle, covering courts and crime and more.

The justice, Erin Gall, was recorded referencing her judicial status and even threatening to \"shoot\" Black teens at the event that turned chaotic late at night, where she was present with her husband and son at a friend's house.\n\nThe New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct released a statement on Monday calling for Gall to lose her job due to her racially offensive and profane behavior during the party. The statement highlighted Gall's misuse of her judicial office, including threats of gun violence and offering preferred treatment to the police present, by stating, \"[y]ou know I am on your side.\"\n\nIt's important for readers to understand that although Gall is a state justice, the Supreme Court in New York is actually the trial court, and the highest court is the New York Court of Appeals. This distinction is vital in comprehending the hierarchy of the New York judicial system.\n\nThe commission said that Gall disqualified herself as judge by what she said and did when the New Hartford party, which had started on the evening of July 1, 2022, and continued into the night, went off the rails after midnight.\n\nAccording to the commission's determination, Gall testified that though there was a bartender and a keg at the party, she \"did not consume any alcohol at the party, did not take any prescription medications or illicit drugs before or during the party, and was sober during the entirety of the party and throughout the events of July 2, 2022.\"\n\nThe documents said Gall defended herself against the allegations in three ways, one of which was to say her actions were \"the result of extreme distress triggered by [redacted] associated with an assault\" against her when she was a freshman at Boston College in 1990, and another of which was to say that she was \"emotionally distraught\" upon seeing her husband and son \"attacked\" at the party by \"individuals whom respondent and her family members had never seen before and whom they believed were uninvited.\"\n\nCellphone video included as an exhibit showed the fracas unfold, with one teen apparently shouting \"WorldStar.\"\n\nMost of the video exhibits are blurred, seemingly to protect the identities of individuals who are either not clearly adults or not relevant to the case at hand.\n\nBut a few recordings after the fighting subsided showed Gall at the scene talking to cops and remarking about the Black teens by saying \"they don't look that smart\" and \"they're not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nThe panel said that amid the melee one of the teens lost a car key and was looking for it later, but Gall didn't want that to happen, and demanded the group be \"arrested.\"\n\nBy this point, Gall was in contact with law enforcement and said \"when they trespass you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property,\" the panel said.\n\nGall, the panel said, was not pleased the officer didn't call her judge.\n\n\"Don't call me 'Lady.' 'Judge.' It's 'Judge,\"\" documents said. \"You guys didn't really do much.\"\n\n\"If you're not invited by a homeowner, it's still trespassing. I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this,\" Gall also said, according to the panel.\n\nGall, the documents said, was also heard screaming at the teens while repeatedly identifying herself as a judge.\n\n\"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property. That's what I'm saying. No. Done. You're done. Done, done, done. Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a f -- ing judge!\" the panel recounted her words. \"And I'm telling you! Get off the f -- ing property! No, judge. It's judge. I could give a f -- . . . . I don't want anyone on the property. If I have to clear it out, I will.\"\n\n\"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening. That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll,\" the panel further quoted Gall. \"That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\"\n\nOne panelist, Colgate University Prof. Nina Moore, wrote a concurrence (which one other member joined), saying that Gall acknowledged her remarks that the Black teens didn't look smart and didn't have a business school in their futures at minimum created an appearance of racial bias. But Moore went much further, writing that Gall's \"that's how I roll\" words were a \"mocking blaccent.\"\n\nMoore also doubted Gall's claim that being an assault survivor triggered her more than 30 years later in a \"racialized\" way.\n\nBlack litigants, attorneys, court staff and others who enter a New York state courtroom are entitled to equal justice. They should not have to carry the additional burden of wondering whether their matters will be adjudicated by a judge of sound and sober mind, or a traumatized judge with a proclivity toward racial stereotyping and racially tainted directives. Inexplicably, respondent's 1990 trauma took the form of racialized behavior on July 2, 2022. Her derisive deployment of Black English (aka \"African American vernacular,\" \"Ebonics,\" and \"blaccent\") is jolting.\n\n[...]\n\nJudge Gall's mocking blaccent is in addition to the other racialized behaviors noted in the majority opinion, including her assessment of the four Black male teenagers as less than Business School material and the hint that they could not afford cocaine -- reflexive assessments that she made with no personal knowledge whatsoever of the four Black teens. The defense argument that the teens' behavior was distinctive and merited such harsh judgement is belied by the fact that Judge Gall's own husband and son had, in her words, just given someone a \"smack down,\" and at her friend's party where police officers observed many teens had been drinking or were intoxicated. Critically, respondent's words on the night of the incident did not pertain to behavior. They expressly targeted physical features. She stated: \"They don't look like they're that smart.\"\n\nThe panel as a whole concluded that Gall, rather than \"leaving the chaotic situation, for over an hour, [...] repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the Rules,\" conduct that was \"unbecoming a judge, brought reproach upon the judiciary and irreparably damaged her ability to serve as a judge.\"\n\nWhile the panel recommended removal from office, Gall's lawyer said she should at most be sanctioned.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racialization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American Vernacular English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colgate University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority opinion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Young_Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Young Writers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Judge-should-lose-job-for-threat-to-shoot-Black-teens.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Gall, tried to use her position to influence police and demonstrated racial bias and bias in favor of law enforcement.\n\nThe commission wrote in their determination that Gall participated in a \"racially offensive, profane, prolonged public diatribe outside a high school graduation party.\"\n\nThe police body camera footage from the party in July 2022 shows the judge threatening to shoot a group of Black teens if they returned to her friend's property. A police officer warns her this isn't Texas, you can't do that.\n\nThe judge threatened to speak to officers' supervisors when police officers did not do as she suggested. She repeatedly tells officers she's a judge.\n\nShe also bragged to a police officer that she taught her son to beat others up if they attacked him, one video shows. In another video, she mocks the Black teens' intelligence.\n\nThe commission released the videos showing the judge's conduct in an 80-minute interaction with police, a group of four Black teens and a family member of one of the teens.\n\nGall -- a justice for the Fifth Judicial District based in Oneida County -- conceded to the commission that she invoked her position as a judge more than a dozen times and made statements that could appear racially insensitive and others that demonstrated a bias toward law enforcement at the detriment of civil rights, according to the commission.\n\nIn testimony to the commission, Gall denied that her actions were intentionally racist or biased.\n\nSyracuse.com | The Post Standard has compiled from the videos a list of statements Gall made that the commission cited as reasons for their recommendation that she should be removed from her seat.\n\nGall is suspended with pay. She has 30 days to appeal the commission determination. If she does not file the appeal, she will be removed from office.\n\nRelated Article: State calls for removing CNY Supreme Court judge after 'racially offensive, profane' display at party\n\nGall was a guest at the graduation party hosted by Stephen Pearce, an attorney and friend of Gall's, at Pearce's home on Tibbits Road in New Hartford. The party started July 1, 2022 and continued into the early hours of July 2.\n\nPolice arrived at the graduation party around 12:20 a.m. on July 2 after a fight broke out. The fight began after large groups of teens showed up at the house uninvited. When officers arrived Gall immediately introduced herself as judge. (0:10 in the video below)\n\nAs the party is clearing out, four Black teens are searching for a lost car key by the side of the road. Gall told police that the teens were involved in the fights. As the teens searched for the keys, Gall began yelling at them and announced her position as a judge again.\n\n\"Get off the property, and that is from Judge Gall,\" she said. \"I am a f--king judge\"\n\n(2:30 in the video below).\n\nGall began to tell people to stop searching for keys and stated she didn't care about the keys. An officer then tells her that they care about the keys and asks her to calm down.\n\nHe reminds Gall that this is not her home. Gall responded that it is her \"jurisdiction\" and became upset when the officer laughed at her response.\n\nAt the end of the clip below, an officer can be heard quietly saying that he doesn't care who she is.\n\nAs Gall continues to speak to officers about the lost keys, she says that the keys were only lost because the teens were involved in a fight.\n\nWhen the officer responds that the teens are waiting for someone to come pick them up with a spare key, she tells the officer they should be held in the back of a police car despite not being under arrest or charged with any crime. (1:15 in the video below).\n\nOne officer tells Gall that they will not risk infringing on the rights of the teens. He tells her they could end up in front of her with a civil rights case if they do not handle it properly.\n\nGall tells the officer that the \"good part\" is that she is on their side and would \"take down anyone\" for the officers. (0:45 in the video below.)\n\nAs Gall is speaking to officers about the alleged assault against her husband and son, an officer says that the group of Black teens appeared to have gotten the \"worst of\" any injuries.\n\nGall responds that she taught her son well and he \"put a smackdown.\" As she brags about the \"smackdown\" she repeatedly punches her hand. (1:18 in the video below).\n\nA deputy tried to explain why they could not remove the teens from the street or arrest them, as Gall suggested. He told her that she would have to file a charge with the New Hartford Police the next day and the sheriff's office was not the agency handling the case.\n\nGall told the deputy she could call a sergeant she knows and get the paperwork done to arrest the teens. ( 3:36 in the video below)\n\nGall tells officers that her group will not search for the keys and they are likely lost. She then says that if the teens pushed the start button in the car it would likely turn on and they would find the key with them.\n\nWhen an officer says their car did not look like it had a push start, she responded by saying: \"They don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\" This was a reference to her own son attending Boston College's business school in the fall. (0:41 in video below).\n\nAs the sister of one of the teens begins to gather the boys to leave, a partygoer yells at the group. The sister responds that he looks like a \"cokehead.\" Gall then says: \"You look like a cokehead, okay. We might be able to afford the coke, but we don't do it.\" (0:24 in the video below.)\n\nAs the group is getting ready to drive away, the officers tell Gall that it would be best if they found the keys and returned them to police so that no one would have to come back to look for them.\n\nGall responds by saying that if they found the keys they would flush them down the toilet. An officer tells her not to clog her toilet.\n\nGall says that if the teens returned to the property she would shoot them.\n\n\"Because when they trespass you can shoot them on the property,\" she said. \"I'll shoot them on the property.\" (1:03 in the video below).\n\nOfficers quickly tell her that is not allowed. One officer tells her: \"This isn't Texas. You can't shoot somebody for simply going on your property,\" according to the commission. The officer's statement cannot be clearly heard in the videos made public by the commission.\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made to the commission, which spurred the investigation and disciplinary process.\n\nGall told the commission she reacted as a mother and a wife who saw her loved ones - son and father - in a fight and said she regretted her actions. Despite admitting her mistakes, she maintained that her actions should be punished with a censure rather than her removal from office.\n\nNo arrests were made from the party.\n\nSyracuse.com | The Post Standard called Gall's chambers and contacted her attorney multiple times. Neither has have responded.\n\nIn the end, the commission found that \"impropriety permeated respondent's conduct\" and her choices \"irreparably damaged her ability to serve as a judge.\"\n\nIn 46 years, the commission has issued 184 determinations of removal.

Her wide array of misconduct severely undermined public confidence in the judiciary and in her ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge,\" the commission wrote in their report.\n\nThe incident took place on July 1, 2022, at a friend's home in New Hartford, New York. Gall attended with her husband and three teenage children. A fight broke out involving uninvited guests, including several Black teenagers. According to the commission's findings, Gall, a white Republican who has served in Oneida County since 2012, used her judicial authority inappropriately, attempting to have the teenagers arrested, threatening violence, and making racially insensitive comments.\n\n\"When a group of four Black teens arrived at the party, having received a text message with the address, physical fighting broke out, in the course of which the key to the teens' car was lost,\" the commission's report states.\n\nFive police agencies were then called to end the dispute.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct via email for comment.\n\nThe commission also shared various video footage from the scene that captured Gall's remarks, where she can be heard telling the teenagers, \"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property.\" She also boasted about her judicial position, saying, \"That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls.\" Adding, \"I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this.\"\n\nThe situation then escalated as Gall attempted to have the teenagers arrested for trespassing, using her status to pressure law enforcement officers. According to the report, Gall made several derogatory remarks, including suggesting that the teenagers \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure,\" and then stated that if they returned, \"you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nHowever, in response Gall's attorney, Robert Julian, \"proposed that a sanction less than removal be imposed,\" the commission report states.\n\nIn addition, Gall said she intends to appeal the commission's decision, arguing that her actions were influenced by a traumatic assault she experienced in 1990, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Judge Gall has been remorseful, apologetic and accepting of responsibility. She acknowledged from the very beginning that she was embarrassed by her conduct and humiliated at the way in which she reacted to the unforeseen events that had occurred,\" Julian wrote in a brief included among the items released by the commission. \"It is the opinion of her psychologists that her conduct was secondary to a trauma reaction, which we offer not as an excuse but as an explanation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian condemned Galls' actions in a statement that accompanied the report.\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people,\" Tembeckjian said. \"Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.\"\n\nGall, who earns an annual salary of $232,600 and whose current term ends in 2025, is currently suspended with pay while the New York Court of Appeals decides her fate, the AP reports.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Commission_on_Judicial_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Panel-Urges-Removal-of-Judge-Who-Allegedly-Threatened-to-Shoot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

It happened at a house party near Utica in the summer of 2022, but police body cam video and report findings from the incident are just now being released.\n\nThis week the Commission on Judicial Conduct called the judge's actions racially offensive, saying she can no longer serve as a fair and impartial judge.\n\nA new video just released captures state Supreme Court Justice Erin Gall threatening to shoot a group of black teenagers.\n\n\"They'll be shot on the property, because when they trespass you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\nThe judge was at a high school graduation party at her friend's house near Utica in July 2022 when authorities said there was an argument between invited and uninvited guests. A group of black teenagers who received a text invite to the party with the address then arrived and a fight broke out shortly after.\n\nDuring the scuffle the teens lost the keys to their car and couldn't leave the neighborhood, appearing to upset Gall who wanted the children to leave but refused to turn over their car keys if she found them.\n\n\"If the key turns up we're absolutely going to throw them in the toilet you're welcome. Put them in the back of the cop car and let them wait there,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\nFive law enforcement agencies arrived on the scene during the more than hour-long ordeal. During which the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct said the judge repeatedly invoked her judicial office.\n\n\"Get off the property and that's from Judge Gall I'm a freaking judge and I'm telling you get off the freaking property. Listen I'm a supreme court judge,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\nThey also say she threatened gun violence and both criticized and pledged favored treatment for the police.\n\n\"I'll shoot them on the property. If I have to clean it out I will,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\n\"Listen but guess what? The part is, the good part is, I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that, you know that, you know that I am on your side,\" said Judge Gall when speaking with responding law enforcement officers.\n\nThe video also captures the Judge making comments about the black teens' intelligence levels.\n\n\"They don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school that's for sure,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\nAnd captures her praising her son for beating up partygoers among other comments.\n\n\"Smackdown once he got hit. Put a smackdown,\" said Judge Gall captured on police body camera footage.\n\nThe commission is now calling for the judge to be removed from the bench.\n\nCommission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian released a statement saying:\n\n\"It is utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice, promise favorable treatment for the police, or disparage a law intended to keep guns away from dangerous people. Any one of these things would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. That all this and more was committed by one judge disqualifies her from further service on the bench.\"\n\nGalls' attorney did provide a statement in a brief released by the commission saying the judge was in shock at the time, saying the incident triggered a trauma response to her own assault in the 90s.\n\nJudge Gall said in part \"I was acting as a mom who just witnessed something awful. I wasn't acting appropriately or thinking the right way\" Gall also says she attended counseling following the incident.\n\nIt's now up to the Court of Appeals to decide whether or not to remove Gall.

Four Black teenagers arrived after learning of the party from a live video feed, and the driver then lost his car keys, the report said.\n\nArguments and fights broke out between invited and uninvited guests, and officers from several law enforcement agencies responded.\n\nPolice body camera footage showed Gall telling the Black teenagers, \"You got to leave! You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property.\"\n\nShe then said, \"Well, you're going to get in an Uber, buddy, or you're going to get a cop escort home. That's how it's happening. That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nGall tried to get the police to arrest the Black teenagers for trespassing, saying, \"I've done this for a million years. I'm a lawyer. I'm a judge. I know this.\"\n\nShe also yelled at the teenagers to \"Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a judge!,\" using a profanity.\n\nThe body camera footage shows that Gall alternated between complaining that the officers weren't arresting anyone and assuring officers that she was on their side.\n\n\"Listen, but guess what, the good part is - the good part is I'm always on your side,\" she said. \"You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that.\"\n\nGall told police that the Black teenagers \"don't look like they're that smart. They're not going to business school, that's for sure.\"\n\nShe also said that if the teenagers were to come back looking for their keys, \"you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nThat's How I Roll!\n\nActually, I know where to start: WTF was up with all of Gall's \"That's how I roll\" nonsense? Gall sounded like white people who condescendingly try to appeal to Black people by saying corny Caucasian things like, \"Hey, what's up, my gangsta homies. Let's go do a drive-by at the cookout and go find where the hoes at, right, my brotha?\"\n\nAnd I don't think I need to explain to Black people that her remarks about how the Black teens \"don't look like they're that smart\" is coded language. What does she know about these teens besides the fact that they're Black?\n\nThe real issue, of course, is that she was actively trying to get the cops to arrest the teens, who, again, were clearly trying to do exactly what she was demanding, which is to \"get off the property\" -- property that she doesn't even own, lest we forget. She also threatened deadly force against the teens if they came back to the property THAT ISN'T HER PROPERTY if they were to come back looking for their keys, which means, in front of police officers and their body-worn cameras, she threatened to shoot teenagers with the full knowledge that they were not on the property with the intent to do anyone or anything harm. (But it's the Black teens who aren't \"that smart,\" right?)\n\nSupreme Court Karen\n\nSource: Drew Angerer / Getty\n\nGall's behavior was \"as shocking as anything I have seen in my 40 years of judicial ethics enforcement,\" said Robert H. Tembeckjian, the commission's administrator and counsel.\n\nOn the night of the incident, Supreme Court Karen also boasted to police that her 18-year-old son had \"put the smackdown\" on another partygoer. She claimed, \"My husband and son got hit first . . . but they finished. Like I taught 'em.\"\n\nAfter the commission's report was released, Gall's attorneys made the \"smackdown\" sound a lot more like a situation where her son got beat up and was the true victim of the melee.\n\n\"The Respondent's son was slapped, hit, knocked to the ground, kicked in the head and body and beaten by four or more of the uninvited individuals. Her husband, in an attempt to rescue their son and stop the fight, began pulling teenagers off of the pile and was assaulted himself in the process. He sustained bruising and swelling to both ears and his shirt was torn,\" her lawyers claimed in a written response to the commission's report.\n\nThe puffed-out chest Gall had on the night of the event also seemed to shrink significantly once the investigation into her actions began.\n\nMore from NBC:\n\nGall testified during the investigation, saying that the violent skirmishes at the graduation party triggered memories of a 1990 assault she suffered as a college student. Julian did not dispute his client's comments, but said she was in a \"state of fear, dismay, frustration and exhaustion\" when she made them.\n\nAnyway, Gall's attorney, Robert Julian, said Tuesday that she'll appeal the panel's determination.\n\nYeah -- good luck with all that.\n\nSee More:\n\nJudge Orders Release Of More Racist Text Messages From Former San Jose Cop Who Sent 'I Hate Black

Damn sure ain't her.\n\nJudges are supposed to be the neutral part of the government. Not only ought they just call balls and strikes, it is constitutionally vital that they do so. Judicial neutrality is a threshold separation of powers issue. Why? Because that neutral evaluation of the facts should act as an important buffer to separate the abuses that come down from the Executive branch, namely the police, from legitimate government action. In these cases, the idea of separation is a sham if it turns out that the judge was helping out the police along the way. In short, if you've had a case involving the police before Judge Erin P. Gall, a little suspicion about the outcome is probably warranted. From the ABA Journal:\n\nA judge in Oneida County, New York, should be removed from the bench for \"truly egregious\" misconduct during a July 2022 high school graduation party outside a friend's home, according to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.\n\nJudge Erin P. Gall, a judge on New York's trial-level supreme court, attended the party with her husband and then-18-year-old son. According to a July 22 press release, the commission determined that Gall engaged \"in a racially offensive, profane, prolonged public diatribe\" in which \"she repeatedly invoked her judicial office, threatened gun violence, and both criticized and pledged favored treatment for the police.\"\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the determination,\" [Gall's lawyer] said.\n\nTo understand this \"disagreement,\" let's dig into the facts a bit. Going in order of importance -- an order I admit is up for debate -- let's start with her declaration of fealty to the police.\n\nWhen a police officer told Gall that they could \"end up in front of your court\" for violating the teens' civil rights, Gall replied, \"Listen, but guess what, the good part is -- the good part is I'm always on your side. You know I'd take anyone down for you guys. You know that. You know that. You know I am on your side.\"\n\nFor the judges and readers at home who give a damn about the rule of law, \"I am on your side\" is the thing you say to a nervous middle schooler during their first big football game, not something you tell a cop worried about violating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Yes, threatening to shoot a kid for picking up their car keys is bad -- we will get to that -- but a judge coming out and encouraging the police to violate civil rights because they're all on the same team is the type of interaction that casts a shadow on the very notion of due process. That doesn't just make her look bad; that makes all judges look bad. It is very hard to maintain the fantasy of the judiciary as the neutral branch of the government when what we see them do is act as handmaidens to coup enthusiasts and the boys in blue.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's get to the shooting teenagers bit of Her Honor's story.\n\nNew Hartford, New York, police arrived after midnight. Gall identified herself as a judge and did the same when she screamed at four Black teenagers looking for lost car keys.\n\n\"You got to leave!\" Gall said in comments caught on video. \"You're not going to find your keys. You got to call an Uber and get off the property. That's what I'm saying. No. Done. You're done. Done, done, done. Get off the property! And's that's from Judge Gall! I'm a f- - -ing judge! And I'm telling you! Get off the f- - -ing property!\"\n\n...\n\nGall responded that she would call the police if the teens return.\n\n\"They'll be arrested, or they'll be shot on the property,\" she said. \"Because when they trespass, you can shoot them on the property. I'll shoot them on the property.\"\n\nNow, I'm not sure what her Crim Law professor taught her about trespass, but you can't just shoot teenagers for picking up their car keys if the car keys happened to land on your front lawn. Self-defense arguments usually revolve on claims of immediate and unlawful threats of violence, not if the car keys were on your petunias at the time of shooting. New York is a castle doctrine state for God's sake and, get this, even that doesn't bless shooting teenagers for trying to get their car keys back. If the average Above the Law reader heard a studying 1L claim what Judge Gall did, they'd either jump in to correct them or feel a rush of empathy and compassion for whatever sorry soul has to read and grade the essay they're going to hand in. A judge being that egregiously wrong on when it is and isn't okay to put a bullet in a teenager's head would make me question what other legal quackery is going on when the gavel is in their hands.\n\nIn summary, the Commission had this to say:\n\nGall \"irreparably damaged her integrity by repeatedly invoking her judicial office and forfeited her ability to be and to appear to be impartial, particularly as it relates to race and law enforcement personnel,\" the commission said in its determination. \"Given the range of her misconduct, members of the public can have no confidence in her ability to preside in a fair and unbiased manner.\"\n\nIn a statement, Robert H. Tembeckjian, the commission's administrator, said it is \"utterly unacceptable for a judge to threaten gun violence, exhibit racial prejudice\" and \"promise favorable treatment for the police.\"\n\nI'm not sure what's left for Gall or her lawyer to be in disagreement with.\n\nJudge Who Threatened To Shoot Black Teens For Trespassing Should Be Ousted, Judicial Conduct Commission Says [ABA Journal]", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the Law"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_williams@abovethelaw.com", "name": "Chris Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Commission_on_Judicial_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABA Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fealty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gavel-gun-GettyImages-1040303006.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1161, "textEnd": 1168}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Tembeckjian, the commission's administrator and counsel, said in a statement.\n\nJustice Gall, a Republican, was elected to the Supreme Court in 2011. Her 14-year-term is set to expire next year. She earns $232,600 a year and, the commission said, will be suspended with pay while the state's Court of Appeals decides her fate. She has 30 days to appeal the commission's determination to the court. Her lawyer, Robert Julian, said she planned to do so.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the determination,\" Mr. Julian said. While he did not dispute the comments at issue, he wrote in a filing with the commission that his client had been in a \"state of fear, dismay, frustration and exhaustion\" when she made them.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oneida County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/22/multimedia/22ny-judge-cjgq/22ny-judge-cjgq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Gall is expected to appeal.\n\nThe Commission on Judicial Conduct Determination claims that Judge Gall \"engaged in a loud, public, prolonged and profanity-laced confrontation with responding police officers and others at the scene during which she repeatedly invoked her judicial office, made comments that cast doubt on her ability to be impartial as a judge by, inter alia, stating Black teenagers at the scene \"don't look like they're that smart\", stating to police officers that if the Black teenagers returned to look for a missing car key, \". . . when they trespass you can shoot them on the property.\"\n\nThe Commission, made up of 11 legal experts, claim Gall didn't stop there, as explained in their decision.\n\n\"I'll shoot them on the property\" and telling a police officer that she was \"always on your side\" when the officer expressed concern about a possible civil rights suit in her court if the Black teenagers were arrested at respondent's urging. The Complaint further alleged that respondent detracted from the dignity of her judicial office...\"\n\nGall has challenged the Commission's determination by claiming \"she was acting as a mother and wife; on the bench she is fair, honest, respectful and conscientious toward all litigants and lawyers; and her conduct on July 2, 2022, was the result of extreme emotional distress triggered by an event associated with an assault that occurred against her back in 1990.\"\n\nIn the Concurring Opinion by Professor Nina M. Moore who was joined by Judge Fernando M. Camacho, Gall's defense of extreme emotional distress from a 1990 attack was dismissed as being a defense that left many questions to be answered.\n\n\"Many, many questions remain as to the precise mechanisms by which respondent's victimization of 1990 accounts for her choices 34 years later, what triggers the trauma effects, and why the effects show up in such peculiar forms. It is difficult to reconcile respondent's after-the-fact claims about her aversion to violence due to the 1990 incident with her boasting on July 2, 2022 of having taught her son to \"put a smack down\" and \"to kick the shit out of anyone who hits him first.\" This, as she repeatedly hit her fist into the palm of her hand.\"\n\nThe Commission commended the responding police officers from New Hartford, as well as others from surrounding agencies.\n\n\"The remarkably temperate decision-making of responding police officers is commendable. Five different law enforcement agencies were marshalled to deal with numerous street fights. Throughout, the responding officers judiciously managed the improper demands of a White female judge for removal on the one hand and, on the other, four Black male teenagers' insistence on staying put to find a car key -- despite the precarious situation at hand.\n\nThe point of note is that police officers had to explain to a judge the multiple reasons why they could not lawfully submit to her pleas to handcuff, detain, arrest and/or remove the teenagers. The officers warned Judge Gall that it would be unlawful for her to shoot someone simply due to trespassing, as she threatened.\"\n\nThe Concurring decision further criticized Gall's behavior, labeling it racially charged in a way that might make it difficult for black litigants to feel they would receive fair treatment in Gall's courtroom.\n\n\"Black litigants, attorneys, court staff and others who enter a New York state courtroom are entitled to equal justice. They should not have to carry the additional burden of wondering whether their matters will be adjudicated by a judge of sound and sober mind, or a traumatized judge with a proclivity toward racial stereotyping and racially tainted directives. Inexplicably, respondent's 1990 trauma took the form of racialized behavior on July 2, 2022. Her derisive deployment of Black English (aka \"African American vernacular,\" \"Ebonics,\" and \"blaccent\") is jolting.\n\nShe averred: \"You know what you're not going to find your mom's keys. You gotta ask her for a second set, bro! ... That's what I'm telling you right now. That's how I roll. That's how I roll. That's how Mrs. G rolls. That's how Judge Gall rolls. We're clearing this place out.\"\n\nJudge Gall's mocking \"blaccent\" is in addition to the other racialized behaviors noted in the majority opinion, including her assessment of the four Black male teenagers as less than Business School material.\"\n\nThe Commission's decision:\n\n\"Given the extent and range of respondent's misconduct, particularly her repeated invocation of her judicial office to the police and to the teenagers, her remarks that created the appearance of racial bias and bias in favor of law enforcement and her decision to complain about how the police handled the matter approximately two weeks after the incident while in the Oneida County Courthouse, we find that respondent engaged in \"truly egregious\" misconduct. Respondent committed multiple violations of several Rules, acted in a manner unbecoming a judge, brought reproach upon the judiciary and irreparably damaged her ability to serve as a judge. By reason of the foregoing, the Commission determines that the appropriate disposition is removal.\"", "source": {"uri": "wibx950.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WIBX 950"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_keeler@wibx950.com", "name": "Bill Keeler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smack_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smack (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperate climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American Vernacular English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vernacular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racialization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/41/files/2024/07/attachment-JudgeGall_poliecam.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754827", "eventUri": "eng-9754827", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

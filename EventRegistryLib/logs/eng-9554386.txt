After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced.\n\nGarelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12.\n\nGarelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman's venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC's merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC's board.\n\nAll three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said.\n\nGarelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC's interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC's board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,\" Williams said.\n\n\"As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,\" the top prosecutor said. \"Garelick's federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.\"\n\nDWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March. Public trading of the company's stock under the new ticker DJT began a day later.\n\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Trump Media's auditor with what the regulator said was \"massive fraud\" involving the auditor's accounting work for hundreds of publicly traded companies, affecting 1,500 SEC filings.\n\nThe auditor, BF Borgers CPA, and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, agreed to be permanently suspended from practicing as accountants before the SEC, and to pay a combined $14 million in civil penalties.\n\nTrump Media hired a new auditor, Semple, Marchal & Cooper LLP last weekend to replace BF Borgers.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_mangan@nbcchicago.com", "name": "Dan Mangan", "type":

The investor, Bruce Garelick, had been on the board of directors of the company, Digital World Acquisition Corp., at the time it was negotiating plans to merge with Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app.\n\nTrump Media's majority shareholder is former President Donald Trump, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick's trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTwo co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick's case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer.\n\n\"Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement.\n\nRead more: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/09/trump-media-investor-convicted-of-insider-trading-ahead-of-merger.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Media_&_Technology_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Media & Technology Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Williams_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Williams (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special-purpose acquisition company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554386", "eventUri": "eng-9554386", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 695}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 983, "textEnd": 990}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Two of his co-defendants pleaded guilty before the trial began.\n\nGarelick, who was found guilty on all five counts facing him, sighed deeply and began to sob after the verdict was read out. He put his face in one hand and said, \"So unfair.\"\n\nWhen the media startup operating Trump's social platform began trading in March, it generated billions of dollars in new wealth for the former president, who owns a stake of about 65%. The windfall came as Trump faced mounting legal fees in fighting his many criminal and civil cases, as well as a costly campaign for a return to the White House in the November election.\n\nThe verdict was delivered in a courthouse around the corner from where Trump is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to conceal an affair with an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election. Trump and his company weren't accused of wrongdoing in the insider-trading case.\n\nGarelick, a hedge fund portfolio manager who joined DWAC's board of directors in 2021, was accused of tipping off his boss, Michael Shvartsman, about the merger plan. Shvartsman is the founder of Rocket One Capital LLC, a Miami-based venture capital firm where Garelick was the chief strategy officer. Shvartsman's brother Gerald also traded on the secret information.\n\nVolatile Shares\n\nThe Shvartsman brothers, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud weeks before the trial, and Garelick made about $22 million between them, but Garelick's share was only about $50,000, prosecutors said.\n\nDigital World's acquisition of Trump Media has triggered ongoing legal headaches for a handful of people involved in the deal. Trump and two co-founders of Trump Media are embroiled in civil litigation.\n\nShares of Trump Media have been volatile since going public, after hitting an intraday peak of $79.38 in their debut on Nasdaq before tumbling below $23. At 1:10 p.m. in New York on Thursday, they were up 7.3% to $52.90.\n\nTrump Media has captivated individual investors who piled into the stock and touted their investments across the Truth Social platform as a way to support Trump's election campaign, driving the company's market value to top $9.3 billion despite generating modest revenue last year.\n\nTrump holds a nearly 115 million-share stake in the company, worth some $6.1 billion, but he can't sell any of the stock until September without permission from the board.\n\nSpecial purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are those with no commercial operations that are formed to raise capital through an initial public offering of shares to acquire or merge with an existing company. Also known as blank-check companies, SPACs quickly evolved from an obscure corner of the financial world to an investing craze before coming under more government scrutiny.\n\nIn his closing statement Wednesday, Garelick's lawyer Jonathan Bach acknowledged that his client bought shares in Digital World Acquisition Corp. But he told the jury Garelick stopped when he learned, through his board seat, of plans to publicly announce the deal. Until then, Bach argued, Garelick didn't know whether the DWAC-Trump Media merger would actually occur.\n\n'Taste of the Action'\n\n\"Why would he act with intent to break the law for $49,000?\" Bach said. \"Why would he risk his whole career and start acting that way?\" Bach suggested another person connected to DWAC may have leaked information about the potential merger.\n\nProsecutors pointed the jury to a time line of trades, emails, texts and phone calls in 2021, arguing the evidence showed Garelick wanted to get ahead of the potential acquisition announcement in October of that year. While DWAC had other potential acquisition targets, Garelick knew it had an inside track on Trump Media, federal prosecutor Matt Shahabian told the jury on Wednesday.\n\nGarelick staggered his purchases over time to avoid detection and failed to file disclosure statements with regulators, Shahabian said.\n\n\"The defendant got greedy,\" Shahabian said. \"He wanted a taste of the action. He knew what he was doing was wrong. He thought no one would notice.\"\n\nGarelick's lawyer argued the slow, gradual investments were just part of a personal trading strategy.\n\nThe case is US v. Shvartsman, 23-cr-307, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\n\n--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz and David Morris.\n\n(Adds details and context starting in third paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special-purpose acquisition company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Securities fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Media_&_Technology_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump Media & Technology Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554386", "eventUri": "eng-9554386", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

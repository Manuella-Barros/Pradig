After playing around with some ingredients, the chef landed on this special recipe that is super easy and ridiculously creamy, reports the Express. Both the pasta and the sauce are made in one pot, so cleaning up is also a simple task. Jamie said: \"Pasta al limone. I can't think of a plate of food that shines a light on lemon flavour in quite the same way. Pasta, lemon and Parmesan come together in alchemy to create something worthy of any table. \"I tested out a lot of pasta al limone recipes before I landed here.\" The chef also explained: \"The starchy water it creates is exactly what is needed to thicken the lemony sauce and coat the pasta.\" While a simple dish, people are encouraged to stir in warmed cannellini beans and garnish with basil for extra flavour. Jamie Oliver's one-pot pasta al limone recipe - serves four Ingredients 400g spaghetti or linguine Two large unwaxed lemons One clove of garlic, peeled and bashed but kept whole 100ml olive oil One teaspoon of flaky sea salt 50g salted butter 40g Parmesan, grated 15g of basil, leaves picked and torn Method Begin by putting 400g linguine into a large lidded saucepan. Grate in the zest of two large lemons and add one clove of garlic, 100ml of olive oil and a teaspoon of salt. Add one litre of boiling water, cover with a lid and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, remove the lid and simmer for eight minutes. Use a pair of tongs to turn the pasta in the thickening pasta water every 30 seconds or so as it cooks. Once the eight minutes are up, squeeze in the juice of one of the zested lemons and simmer for a final two minutes with the lid off. Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and stir in 50g of butter and 20g of grated Parmesan. Leave this to sit for a minute or two. Taste and add more salt, lemon juice and butter or olive oil as needed. Add into four separate bowls and finish with the rest of the Parmesan and basil leaves.

{"id": 243267686, "title": "Airtel and Reliance Jio users, here's the '4-day' trick to avoid mobile tariff hike", "text": "Prepaid customers of Reliance Jio and Airtel have 4 days to dodge upcoming price increases set to start July 3, 2024. Postpaid users, however, cannot avoid the hike.Jio's price increases range from 12-25%, while Airtel's are between 11-21%. For example, Jio's popular Rs 239 monthly plan with 1.5GB daily data will now cost Rs 299, a 25% jump. The price difference for annual data packs could be up to Rs 600 for both companies.Prepaid recharges made before July 3 will keep their current pricing, even if the plan is later discontinued or increased. This offers a chance for savings, especially on long-term plans.If you are a Jio or Airtel subscriber, you can schedule your recharges in advance. All you need to do is recharge for the desired time period before July 3, and your recharges will be activated successively. Please note that this option is only available for Jio and Airtel subscribers. Vodafone Idea subscribers cannot schedule their recharges, and if they do multiple recharges, their plans will all start at the same time.There is no information about the number of recharges Airtel subscribers can queue up. However, Jio has confirmed that its subscribers can queue up to 50 recharges, either on a monthly or yearly basis.Airtel has not made any changes to its unlimited 5G data offer, while Reliance Jio has updated the requirements for availing its unlimited 5G data offer. Jio subscribers will now need to recharge for 2GB plans or above to avail free unlimited 5G data.Postpaid users have no immediate way to avoid the price hike but could consider switching to a lower plan for their next billing cycle if their data usage allows.Reliance Jio: All the new prepaid plans and benefitsExisting Plan Price (Rs)Benefits (Unlimited voice & SMS plans)Validity (days)New Plan Price (Rs)Monthly1552 GB281892091 GB/day282492391.5 GB/day282992992 GB/day283493492.5 GB/day283993993 GB/day284492-month plans4791.5 GB/day565795332 GB/day566293-month plans3956 GB844796661.5 GB/day847997192 GB/day848599993 GB/day841199Annual155924 GB336189929992.5 GB/day3653599Data add-on151 GBbase plan19252 GBbase plan29616 GBbase plan69Airtel: All the new prepaid plans and benefitsTypeMRPValidity (Days)BenefitRevised MRPUnlimited179282GB data, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day199Unlimited455846GB data, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day509Voice Plans179936524GB data, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day1999Voice Plans265281GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day299Voice Plans299281.5GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day349Voice Plans359282.5GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day409Voice Plans399283GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day449Daily Data Plans479561.5GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day579Daily Data Plans549562GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day649Daily Data Plans719841.5GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day859Daily Data Plans839842GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day979Daily Data Plans29993652GB/day, UL Calling, 100 SMS/day3599Data Add-Ons191 day1 GB22Data Add-Ons291 day2 GB33Data Add-Ons65Plan validity4 GB77", "summary": "To avoid upcoming price increases by Jio and Airtel, customers should schedule prepaid recharges before July 3.

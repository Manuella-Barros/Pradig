He wants to spend more time with his family and friends, which because of his F1 commitments, is extremely difficult.\n\nNorris said that everything isn't perfect in his life. Others have similar struggles, but he is fortunate in the sense that there are plenty of people to support him. It is the same that has helped him reach a much better mental state today.\n\nF1 drivers strive for perfection. They want to compete at the highest level, and none of them are happy when they think they could have done better. The same is the case with Norris, but he is more self-critical than most others on the grid.\n\nWhen Norris feels he has let his side down, his mood gets affected severely. The 2024 season itself, has provided a glimpse of many such instances when Norris brought up his failure to perform as well as he thought he should have.\n\nAfter the most recent race in Spa, Norris kept labeling his mistakes as \"stupid\" because he only managed a P5 finish, despite having a car considerably faster than some ahead of him.\n\nNorris' team McLaren, however, continues to back Norris.

That changed when he won the Miami GP earlier this year, but he had to deal with a lot of pressure until he stood on the top step of the podium.\n\nIn a recent event at the McLaren Technology Center, Norris said, \"Formula 1 is simply not all about the driver. It's one of very few sports in the world where it's simply just the team and how you work with other partners.\"\n\n\"I can be the best driver in the world. But if the car is not quick enough, I can't show that,\" he added.\n\nNorris stated that it took a lot of moving parts, and a bit of luck to make things happen on the track for McLaren. He had to keep his head down and focused on what he was tasked with doing - driving to the best of his abilities.\n\nNorris then spoke about the 2021 Russian GP, where he lost out on a race win because of his poor decision-making. From the outside, it was easy to pin the blame on himself, Norris says. But a lot happened, that isn't visible to the public. Still, he took the lion's share of the blame for that particular call.\n\nAhead of the Miami GP, McLaren was touted to be Red Bull's closest rival. The upgraded MCL38 that day proved to be the better car. And Norris cruised to his maiden Grand Prix win, celebrating in style afterward.\n\nThe Bristol-born driver launched a special line of merchandise 'Lando NoWins' - a term people used to troll him in the past.\n\nThat wasn't Norris' only way of shutting critics.

Red Bull's dominance, which has steered Verstappen to a hat-trick of titles, could well be over as the field close in.\n\nNorris finally won a race earlier this season, taking the chequered flag in Miami, and has been in contention to win several others since, becoming a regular on the podium. He is hoping to close the gap to Verstappen with a number of races left in the season.\n\nHis McLaren team-mate, Oscar Piastri has himself become a real force, taking his maiden victory in F1 in Hungary, a race in which Norris was asked to relinquish the lead for his team-mate. Marko now believes the Australian is not just closing in on the Brit but is on the verge of surpassing him - all whilst Verstappen remains out in front.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I don't know what the points gap is between the two. But it looks very much like Piastri is the mentally stronger one and is gradually catching up with Lando over the course of this season and is even faster in some areas.\n\n\"Let's see how the decision turns out.\"\n\nNorris recently missed the chance to close on the Dutchman despite enjoying some qualifying dominance in Belgium. Verstappen had to accept a ten-place grid penalty but still made his way through the field and ended up finishing ahead of Norris.\n\nMarko commented: \"The fact that he was able to keep Norris behind him was a great achievement. That was Max, but as I saw, Norris went off the track twice.\"\n\nNorris himself has bemoaned several missed opportunities which has seen him lose out on race wins and chances to close the gap on Verstappen in the championship standings.

It was a surreal moment for him as he had faced immense criticism until then for his failure to win a race. Now, the 24-year-old has explained the moment he knew he could win the Miami GP.\n\nHe said, \"I went across the line, the safety car came out and the safety car came out behind me. And that was it. As soon as I got out ahead of the safety car, I was like, oh God, this is it. This is my time.\"\n\nEven during the Miami GP, Norris admitted he had made a mistake as he botched the restart.

This victory confirmed that the team's hard work back in Woking was paying off.\n\nIn fact, the MCL38 is arguably the fastest car on the track at the moment and McLaren's pace advantage over Red Bull has also helped them close down the gap in the Constructors' Championship. As things stand, Red Bull only has a 42-point advantage over McLaren.\n\nWhat is more important for McLaren is that both Norris and Oscar Piastri are performing exceptionally well at the moment. That's not the case at Red Bull as Sergio Perez is struggling massively.\n\nIf Perez continues to struggle, McLaren has a fantastic chance of winning the Constructors' Championship as long as they continue their current momentum in the remaining 10 races.

The British driver has had a standout year, clinching his first victory at the Miami Grand Prix, but there's a sense he could have achieved more.\n\nAt 24 years old, Norris, from Glastonbury, commands one of the fastest cars on the grid and boasts significantly more experience than his teammate. However, he has missed chances to win races in Spain and Hungary, a fact he openly acknowledged in a recent interview with Sky Sports.\n\nConversely, Piastri has arguably appeared more composed, securing his first victory in Hungary. During that race, Norris found himself at odds with McLaren over the team radio, seemingly prepared to ignore team orders after taking the lead post-pit stops, according to the Express.\n\nIt was only after 20 laps that Norris conceded, allowing Piastri to secure his first F1 victory. Given Piastri's strong performance and Norris's recent disappointments, former Jordan owner and F1 pundit Eddie Jordan believes that McLaren may soon favour the Australian as their preferred driver, reports the Mirror.\n\nOn the Formula For Success podcast with racing legend David Coulthard, Jordan stated: \"They're going to be fighting each other, they're going to be fighting for grid position.\"\n\n\"They're going to be fighting for race results. It's great for the punters but I'm sure a hell of a ride for the team.\"\n\nHe then issued a stark four-word warning about McLaren's current predicament, stating: \"They are completely confused.\"\n\nHe continued: \"You asked me last week 'Is Lando number one on that team? ' I said to you 'without any question, yes'. And I would still say that today if you ask me, but give me a couple of more races and we might have to adjust that.\"\n\nCurrently, Piastri is 32 points behind his teammate with a score of 167, and could potentially outperform Norris if the current trend continues, considering there are ten more races left in the season. Since Piastri joined McLaren last year, Norris has been viewed as the team's primary driver.\n\nIn addition, both drivers secured their first career grand prix victories this season, becoming the first pair of teammates to accomplish this within a single season since Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya did so for Williams BMW 23 years ago. Norris has not avoided the criticism directed at him, reflecting on his own performances in a conversation with Sky Sports.\n\nNorris admitted: \"Reviewing our season so far, it's been incredible. But from my side, it hasn't been good enough. I'll do what I can, today, tomorrow... it's a time when I can review and reflect on my good things, and also the things I need to and have to improve if I want to be a contender\" he remarked. \"Because at the minute, I don't have what it takes because I've clearly made too many mistakes.\"", "source": {"uri": "somersetlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Somerset Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Coulthard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Coulthard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_orders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team orders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_Schumacher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralf Schumacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Montoya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Pablo Montoya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i2-prod.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/article9467851.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_oscar-piastri.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796951", "eventUri": "eng-9796951", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

At the start of last season when McLaren had one of their worst starts, Lando Norris almost contemplated leaving the iconic Woking-based team. Back at the 2023 Bahrain GP, Norris contrasted his struggles with Hamilton's glorious first few years with McLaren.\n\nThe 24-year-old's comments from then have resurfaced lately on Twitter (now X), causing a lot of uproar. However, to understand the context behind it, Norris was only putting Hamilton in his shoes and explaining how different of a place McLaren was in 2023 relative to 2007-08.\n\nPer GP Blog, Norris said, \"Lewis Hamilton came into McLaren when they were winning championships and winning races, and from the beginning, that makes you look good. If he came into McLaren now, he wouldn't have won a race and he wouldn't have been anywhere near the driver he is today or achieved what he has today\".\n\nNow, Norris has not had the luxury of a race-winning car as Hamilton had from the outset. Since his debut season in 2019, the #4 driver has been getting podiums on the odd occasion but never had the chance to consistently be in the fight for the win.\n\nOn top of that, McLaren's abysmal form in the first half of 2023 was anything but like Hamilton's glorious days at the Woking outfit from 2007 to 2012. While Hamilton struggled in some seasons, his debut year of almost winning the title and finally clinching it in 2008 is something Norris is only dreaming to achieve so far.\n\nThe 2024 season could yield him that opportunity and even Hamilton is hopeful of the same. Norris is currently 78 points behind championship leader Max Verstappen.\n\nAfter sharing the podium with Norris and his teammate Oscar Piastri, Hamilton was in quite a good mood to appreciate McLaren's improvement in performance. While Norris had some banter with the Mercedes maestro, Hamilton stuck to his stance of feeling happy to see his former team do well.\n\nThe seven-time champion also stated that Norris will face a steep challenge to beat Verstappen for the drivers' championship. Before the Belgian GP, the #4 driver was 76 points behind the Dutchman.

Still, McLaren decided to surprise its star driver by introducing him to several puppies in collaboration with Battersea.\n\nMcLaren posted a video on its social media, which shows Norris waiting to meet some fans. However, the Bristol-born driver soon realized that these particular fans walked on all fours. He heard the sounds of dogs barking and as soon as he saw them, his heart melted.\n\n\"This might be the best surprise we've done yet,\" said Norris as he thanked Battersea. He then took his jacket off and took three puppies on his lap, as they played around his arms.\n\nNorris learned that the puppies hadn't seen much of the world and that it was a new experience for them to be in a human's arms. Norris got sentimental and started acting like a proud dog dad.\n\nLater in the video, a three-year-old dog walked in, as Norris sat on the floor, overwhelmed. The McLaren driver hugged the dog from behind and said, \"Makes me want to get a dog now.\" He added how it was his best day ever at the McLaren Technology Center, and that Battersea set the expectation bar really high.\n\nBattersea is a non-profit organization that helps all dogs and cats, including strays by rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming them.\n\nNorris suggested that the dogs would be sad after they left his company. He got busy talking to the dogs, explaining how his home in Monaco wasn't that far away and that he would be back soon. Two puppies got off Norris' lap, but one continually refused to. The puppy felt right at home, the Bristol-born driver said, hopeful.\n\n\"I was expecting people, not dogs,\" Norris added. \"For those who know, I'm a big dog lover.

The host asked him which team would he bet $100 on to win the constructors' championship. To this, Steiner replied that he would bet on McLaren to end their 26-year-long drought of a constructors' championship by beating Red Bull this season.\n\nThe former Haas boss said, \"I would put it on McLaren. I think McLaren could be almost there as well. They had a few mistakes [in the] last races, small mistakes you know, nothing big but that's what made them lose a little bit of points. So, I think they are the most consistent and also the car - it adapts to all the different track layouts.\"\n\nSteiner's assessment of McLaren's season so far is quite apt. The Woking outfit has indeed been the most consistent team, but have left a huge chunk of points and perhaps even two or three race wins on the table.\n\nWhile they are only 42 points behind Red Bull, had they not made certain mistakes in the last five races, they could have even got the championship lead. Regardless, the points swing in their favor has been due to both their drivers scoring consistently ever since the Miami GP.\n\nOn the other hand, Red Bull have been plagued with their car issues and Sergio Perez's struggles holding them back. Max Verstappen has single-handedly kept them afloat in the constructors' fight.\n\nSo, as Steiner said, McLaren have great odds of beating the Milton Keynes outfit to win their first constructors' championship since 1998. However, the same is not the case in the drivers' championship.\n\nDespite not winning a single race in the last four weekends, Verstappen has still maintained a healthy advantage in the drivers' standings. The three-time champion is currently leading Norris by 78 points.\n\nAnd given the way he is maximizing his results despite his recent struggles, Verstappen looks in a good position to win his fourth consecutive championship. On the other hand, Norris and McLaren have not grabbed their opportunities to reduce Verstappen's lead.\n\nThe Canadian and British GP wins went begging for Norris despite the Woking team having the overall fastest car on those weekends. Meanwhile, similar strategic mistakes resurfaced in Hungary -- where luckily they still got a 1-2 finish with Verstappen struggling behind.\n\nThus, heading into the second half of the season, the Dutchman will have to make massive blunders to lose the drivers' championship lead. Moreover, there is no surety of Norris capitalizing on winning those races, given how he has failed to win races since his maiden win in Miami despite being the favorite.\n\nThe Hungarian GP also further exposed McLaren's poor race strategy management and this will only benefit Verstappen and Red Bull.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aishwary_gaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Aishwary Gaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guenther_Steiner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guenther Steiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/3f31c66f-guenther-steiner-smilingg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796951", "eventUri": "eng-9796951", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The downfall started in the second half of 2022 as Alpine overtook them in the championship to finish P4. However, the resurgence started midway through last season and now McLaren are championship contenders. Oscar Piastri hails Andrea Stella for orchestrating this remarkable turnaround.\n\n\"I think Andrea Stella has been a massive benefit to this team. Obviously, he's been here for a while but I think him as a leader in the team principal role has been nothing short of incredible,\" said Piastri in Lissie Mackintosh's YouTube video. The Aussie highlighted how Stella brought a change within the side after being appointed Team Principal.\n\nSuggesting how the performance gains wouldn't have been possible without Stella's skills, Piastri added, \"I know he doesn't like to take the credit for it. But it's true, he's been an incredible leader and a lot of this success wouldn't have been possible without his leadership.\"\n\nZak Brown and Stella initiated a major reshuffle at McLaren after the 2022 disappointment. The Italian became the team principal in December 2022 and has been one of the main reasons for McLaren's performance gains.\n\nMcLaren scored a total of 154 points in the first seven races. But ever since the Miami GP update, the car improved significantly and the team has now scored 212 points in the next seven races. McLaren scored the most points of the top four in the last seven rounds.\n\nAs seen in Max Verstappen's case, the driver also is one of the most important members of a team. After all, one mistake from a driver can cost the team severely. Hence, it is not just Stella and the rest of the engineers who have done remarkably well to help McLaren have a turnaround, but also both Norris and Piastri.\n\nAlthough there have been instances when both Norris and Piastri could have delivered a better result, for the most part, they have been consistent in finishing in the top five. However, when it comes to Red Bull's case, it is only Verstappen who has done most of the scoring.\n\nSince Sergio Perez has been struggling massively for Red Bull, McLaren have managed to reduce the Milton Keynes-based outfit's advantage in the standings to just 42 points.

Speaking ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix Carlos Sainz Jr. went as far as to say that the SF-24 was \"undrivable\" as a result.\n\n\"In high-speed tracks we might have to run the floor of this [older] package because if not, the other one is undriveable,\" said Sainz.\n\n\"I trust the team will make the right calls circuit-to-circuit until a more solid package, which is not bouncing in high-speed and good in low-speed, arrives and then we will start thinking about battling the top three teams again.\"\n\nA podium finish for Leclerc in the Belgian Grand Prix, made possible by George Russell's disqualification, is evidence that the car is still quick enough to keep Ferrari in the conversation. But absent a stunning turnaround, a title seems a difficult task this season.\n\nBased on their recent form alone, Mercedes could top this list.\n\nThe Silver Arrows entered the summer shutdown on a hot streak, having won three of the final four races ahead of the break. Upgrades that the team started rolling out at the Miami Grand Prix have truly improved the performance of the W15, giving both George Russell and Lewis Hamilton a chance at a podium -- or better -- each week.\n\nAnd when the 2024 season is all said and done, Hamilton's emotional victory in the British Grand Prix may go into the books as the most magical moment of the year.\n\nHowever, as impressive as their recent form has been, they face a steep climb to the top of the Constructors' Championship standings. At the moment Mercedes trail Red Bull by 142, and sit 100 points behind second-place McLaren. Even their gap to Ferrari, which clocks in at 79 points, is large.\n\nThe Silver Arrows have the pace to win more races down the stretch, and certainly put pressure on Ferrari for that third spot in the standings. However, their slow start to the season makes the prospect of a title challenge seem unlikely. But they can absolutely end the year strong, putting themselves in a great position for the final year of the current regulations.\n\nThat all adds up to a great environment for welcoming in a driver to replace the soon-to-be-departing Hamilton.\n\nPerhaps a rookie in Andrea Kimi Antonelli?\n\nThis season's British Grand Prix might ultimately tell the story of Red Bull's 2024 season.\n\nThe team got everything right with Max Verstappen in that race. They got the timing right with the switch back to slicks after the rain eased, and the RB20 came alive during Verstappen's final stint on a set of hards, allowing him to rocket by Lando Norris -- on a set of softs -- and make a charge to the front. They got everything right ... and yet Verstappen finished second.\n\nThat result is perhaps the biggest sign yet that this is not 2023.\n\nLast year Red Bull could get everything wrong in a race and Verstappen could still win by ten seconds. But this is not 2023, and the pace of Red Bull's rivals means that even on days when they are perfect, a win might still be out of their grasp.\n\nAdd to that Sergio P\u00e9rez's current struggles, which opened the door to yet another debate over his future with the team, and you have a team truly in a title fight. Yes, they have Verstappen, and yes they enter the second half of the season with a 42-point lead over McLaren. But that is a gap that could, mathematically, be erased over a single race weekend.\n\nTeams can put pressure on them now, forcing Red Bull to be perfect to win.\n\nAnd sometimes, even that is not enough.\n\nIn many ways, McLaren is ahead of schedule, and dealing with growing pains as a result.\n\nWhen I spoke with Zak Brown last October and asked him whether a title fight in 2024 was possible, the McLaren CEO indicated that perhaps 2025 was a more reasonable goal. But they are indeed in that fight, and Brown just this week conceded that it was a \"surprise\" to find themselves challenging for the top spot in the standings.\n\n\"If I were to sit here and say I'm not surprised, that would be disingenuous,\" Brown told BBC Sport this week. \"Red Bull had such an advantage over everyone and Mercedes has been so dominant.\n\n\"I felt like we'd continue to close the gap. Did I think we would be here at the summer break, one race away from getting the lead?\n\n\"That race would have to be first and second and fastest lap, and do I think it's going to happen like that? No. But if we keep the same trajectory we've been on the last six, seven races, we'll be where we need to be by the end of the year,\" continued Brown. \"I thought we might get where we are now by 2025. I didn't think we would be where we are now in 2024. But I'm not complaining.\"\n\nHowever, a word on those growing pains. With a title fight comes learning what it takes to survive at the front of the field. Whether it is on the micro level -- such as Lando Norris learning what it takes to race at the front -- or the macro level, with the team learning how to balance two very fast drivers in Norris and Oscar Piastri as well as the strategy decisions equal with a title-winning team, McLaren is doing some learning right now.\n\nCan they learn those lessons?\n\nWhether they do or not might tell the story of their title fight. But at the moment they have a fast car, two high-performing drivers, and momentum. Since Miami, no team has scored more than McLaren:", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dutch Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Arrows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver Arrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-K--gDaCwqSNUIr0tUzsaV9KrKQ=/0x0:4817x2409/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25564410/2162798205.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796951", "eventUri": "eng-9796951", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

However, few could have predicted the sustained level of performance they have demonstrated in 2024.\n\nAmid a string of ten consecutive podium finishes that started in China last April, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have both tasted Grand Prix glory this season, the former in Miami and the latter more recently in Hungary.\n\n\"If I were to sit here and say I'm not surprised, that would be disingenuous,\" Brown explained, talking to BBC Sport. \"I felt like we'd continue to close the gap.\n\n\"Did I think we would be here at the summer break, one race away from getting the lead - that race would have to be the first and second and fastest lap, and do I think it's going to happen like that?

The reigning world champions have been hampered by inconsistencies from Sergio Perez, but Max Verstappen's dominance means they cannot be discounted.\n\nBrown is therefore wary of declaring McLaren champions-elect for the first time since 1998, even despite the team's current strength and momentum.\n\n\"It's going to be tough. I think it's going to come down to the last race. There's not much between the cars,\" commented the American.\n\n\"It's gonna come down to how does Sergio Perez perform? If he can perform as he's capable of performing, it's going to be a hard fight. If he continues to perform as he has this year, we have a pretty good chance.\"\n\nThe battle for the Drivers' championship is also heating up, with Lando Norris emerging as a genuine threat to Max Verstappen. However, the McLaren driver - like his team - has made some crucial errors this season, hindering his title aspirations.\n\n\"We've all made a variety of errors, which to me are learning experiences,\" Brown stated. \"I think maybe because we have got where we are quicker than we thought, it shows we still have learning to do.\n\n\"We probably should have finished first and second at Silverstone.

I thought we would continue to close the gap, but did I expect to be here at the summer break, one race away from the lead? Probably not. But if we maintain our trajectory over the last six or seven races, we should be in a strong position by the end of the year.\"\n\nAfter starting the season 115 points behind Red Bull following the Miami Grand Prix, where Lando Norris secured his first victory, McLaren has turned their performance around. The team has seen at least one driver on the podium in every race since and recently welcomed newcomer Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to their roster.\n\nBrown acknowledged the importance of the mental aspect of success and emphasized that consistency will be key for McLaren as they seek to leverage their current performance into future victories. The team is also dealing with the pressure that comes from competing at the top level.\n\nReflecting on McLaren's performance, Brown said, \"We can take a lot of positives from this season so far. There's been some tough learning experiences along the way, but we're much better positioned now than we anticipated at the start of the year.\"\n\nThe transformation at McLaren can be attributed in part to the appointment of Andrea Stella as team principal in December 2022. Brown moved swiftly to promote Stella after learning that then-team principal Andreas Seidl would be joining Audi in 2025.\n\nSince Stella's appointment, McLaren has made significant strides, admitting they initially expected a slow start due to design issues from the previous season. The major car upgrade in mid-2023 propelled them from the lower midfield to competing closely with top teams like Ferrari and Mercedes.\n\nBrown highlighted the impact of Stella's leadership, saying, \"He unlocked the talent that we already had here.

Many fans asked if a miniature version of the same would be sold on Norris' website but that wasn't the case. And the fact that Norris grabbed a pole position while wearing this helmet further makes it special.\n\nThe Helmet was listed on F1 Authentics for auction. The bidding started at \u00a33000 before the auction eventually closed with a bid price of \u00a343,001 [$54,604].\n\nThe auction was held on the site itself and started on 23rd July before closing on the 6th of August. Norris started the process of getting this special helmet designed for him over eight months before this year's Hungarian GP.\n\nThe intricate design, as seen on the podium trophies was to be replicated on the helmet. The proceeds from the helmet will be given to charity. F1 Authentics mentioned,\n\n\"This helmet, used by Norris in the Hungarian qualifying, is now being auctioned in order to raise money for two charities, both supporting young people who struggle with visual impairment and blindness. The Hungarian National Association of the Blind and Visually Impaired & Royal Society of Blind Children.\"\n\nThis special design was Norris' way of apologizing to the concerned parties regarding the 2023 Hungarian GP podium celebration shenanigans.\n\nNorris finished on the podium at the 2023 Hungarian GP and decided to celebrate in his iconic style by using the pop-up champagne celebration. However, this action of his caused Verstappen's trophy to fall off the podium and break.\n\nNorris apologized for the same but wanted to do something more. Hence, he got the idea of putting the design on his helmet. The McLaren driver even visited the factory this year for the same and on making such a visit, he appreciated the art even more.\n\nJust like the helmet, the trophies also take months to make as everything is hand-painted.

I'd like to see both drivers in the top three,\" the American explained.\n\n\"We've got second and fourth right now.

Max Verstappen is currently top of the drivers' standings, 78 points ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in second.\n\nMcLaren also sit second in the constructors' championship, 42 points behind Red Bull, and Brown is confident his team have what it takes to end Verstappen and Red Bull's recent dominance. When asked if McLaren plan to focus on either the drivers' or constructors' championship when the season restarts, Brown insisted they plan to prioritise them both.\n\n\"They are both [drivers' and constructors'] priorities because, ultimately, to win the constructors', we need our two drivers to be as high up as possible,\" he told Sky Sports F1. \"I'd like to see both drivers in the top three.\n\n\"We've got second and fourth right now. And the closer we get to the drivers', the closer that'll get us to the constructors', so we're going for both because all points count. I guess the next big occasion for us would be trying to go for the championship.\n\n\"It's certainly a nice feeling. The drivers, the team and everyone has done a wonderful job to get 10 podiums in a row. It is pretty awesome. To be competing for the Drivers' and the Constructors' Championship is a pretty cool place to be coming into the summer break.\n\n\"So there's a lot of work you have to do, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be an exciting second part of the year, but I'm very happy with everything that's been accomplished here at McLaren.\"\n\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri, though, says winning the constructors' championship is the team's \"first target\". The Australian revealed: \"The first objective is to win the constructors' for the team and I think we've got a very strong chance of doing that.\n\n\"We've been closing the gap to Red Bull in the last six or seven races. I think for me, the drivers' standings, of course I'd like to finish as high as I can. I'm not not out of the running for the championship myself, it's a very big ask, but I want to string together good races, build consistency on that front, and really help the team to win the constructors.\n\n\"If it comes to a situation where I need to help Lando later in the year then of course it is something we'll discuss, but the first target is to win the constructors' and try do a good job for myself as well.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

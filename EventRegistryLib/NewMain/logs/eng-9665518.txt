In the trailer, Biles wipes away tears as she reflects on the unexpected exit from the 2021 Olympics and the mental stress she experiences as a world-renowned athlete.\n\n\"I wanted to quit like 500,000 times,\" Biles said in the trailer, \"and I would have if it weren't for my people.\"\n\nBiles spent two years out of competition after winning four gold medals at the 2016 Olympics. Biles has also spoken up about the lingering cloud hanging over USA Gymnastics following the Larry Nasser sex abuse scandal. (Nassar abused about 300 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment and in 2018, was sentenced to 100 years in prison.) In a 2021 Today show interview, Biles said she was \"still scared to do gymnastics\" after dealing with the disorienting condition \"the twisties.\"\n\n\"To do something that I've done forever and just not be able to do it because of everything I've gone through is really crazy because I love this sport so much,\" Biles said. \"It's hard. I'm sorry. And I don't think people understand the magnitude of what I go through, but for so many years to go through everything that I've gone through having a front, I'm proud of myself.\"\n\nThe documentary, directed by Katie Walsh, also features interviews with Biles' husband and Chicago Bears player Jonathan Owens, mother Nellie Biles, and Olympic medalist and gymnast Aly Raisman.

Their life story, struggles and the never give up attitude is inspiring for a common man. In this context, Netflix will be releasing its documentary titled 'Simone Biles Rising' in June. This will trace the journey of Simone Biles who is part of the US Gymnastic team, up to the Paris Olympics in 2024. The trailer of this documentary has been released by the OTT platform. This comes immediately after Prime Video is expected to release the 'Twelve Final Days' involving the life of another sporting legend Roger Federer on June 20. The Simon Biles Rising documentary has a logline which reads \"one of the most powerful comebacks in history\".\n\nIn the trailer's opening, Biles says \"I have always had really good intuitions about things. Unfortunately, I felt that way about the Olympics\". The athlete is probably referring to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in which she had to drop out after battling mental blocks. This eventually forced her to take a mental health break. The trailer also has footages of Biles taking a decision to skip the Paris Olympics in all likelihood. In an inspiring move, she returns to the gym after deciding to prepare for the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n\nThe athlete who was tackling many mental health challenges in the documentary says that she felt like giving up 50,000 times if not for the support she received from people close to her. Her husband Jonathan Owens added that she bounced back. Biles also said that \"I knew it would be a long journey, but for me, it wasn't done\".\n\nThe four-part documentary will release on Netflix on July 17 when it will premiere.\n\nFAQ's\n\nWho else is seen in the documentary 'Simone Biles Rising'?\n\nApart from Simon Biles, her fellow Olympian gymnast Aly Raisman and her family members are also seen. Her husband is an important part of the documentary. The couple got married in 2023.\n\nDid Simon Biles win any medal at the Olympics?\n\nShe participated in the 2016 Olympics at Rio De Janeiro.

But mental health issues that worsened because of the isolating COVID restrictions in Tokyo resulted in \"the twisties,\" causing her to lose her sense of where she was in the air.\n\n\"I've always had really good intuition about things,\" she said in the \"Rising\" trailer, \"and unfortunately I felt that way about the Olympics.\"\n\nUnwilling to risk her physical safety, Biles withdrew during the team final. She missed four individual event finals before returning for the balance beam final, where she won a bronze medal with a reworked routine that didn't require her to do any twisting.\n\nBiles left Tokyo unsure if she'd compete again. She was scarred by the vitriol and nastiness people directed at her and, worse, she didn't trust her own gymnastics. Though she initially went back to the gym to stay in shape, she realized she didn't want her illustrious career to end with Tokyo.\n\n\"I wanted to quit like 500,000 times. And I would have if it weren't for my people,\" Biles said in the trailer for the docuseries, which includes interviews with her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, family, coaches and friends.\n\nRio teammate Aly Raisman, who remains close with Biles, is also featured in the docuseries.\n\n\"I know that she's expected to win all the gold medals, but even the fact she's trying to come back is really amazing,\" Raisman said.\n\nSince returning to competition last year, Biles has been dominant. She won her sixth all-around title at the world championships, and her five medals overall gave her 37 at worlds and the Olympics, making her the most-decorated gymnast ever, male or female.\n\nShe swept all six events at the U.S. championships earlier this month, including winning her ninth all-around title.\n\n\"I knew it would be a long journey,\" Biles says in Rising. \"But to me, I knew it wasn't done.\"\n\n\"Rising\" is the first of three docuseries from Netflix and the International Olympic Committee. \"Sprint,\" which follows world champions Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson, also air ahead of the Paris Olympics.

And for Simone, the world had a front row seat as her private struggle with mental health exploded on the international stage - forcing her to withdraw from the competition.\n\nSince then, Simone has put in the hard work: facing the difficult traumas of her past, learning to manage her mental health, embracing her journey, and in the process, rebuilding her gymnastics from the ground up. Her courage to soar knows no bounds as this summer she plans to return to the Olympic stage once again to do what she's always done - be the best Simone that she can be. Because through it all, Simone still rises.\n\nBiles took to Instagram to promote the new series\n\nWe love that Biles' husband Jonathan Owens and good friend/teammate Aly Raisman are taking part in this.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY\n\nJust when fans thought Simone Biles was done with her gymnastics career, she came for more and swept everyone off the floor with her moves. Her comeback story has inspired several young gymnasts who admire her as their hero. And now, all of her ups and downs are stitched together in the form of a grand Netflix documentary.\n\n'Simone Niles: Rising' aims to showcase how the star gymnast faced one of her greatest challenges in the form of the Tokyo Olympics and how she tackled the consequences. Throughout the ordeal, her friends and family also chip in to talk about how they saw their beloved gymnast struggling and moving on.\n\nThe official trailer for the documentary was up on both Netflix's and Biles' social media profiles, with several clips that created intrigue. From various clips from the Tokyo Olympics to some unseen behind-the-scenes footage of her family and friends, the teaser looked exciting.\n\nIt featured Biles narrating her side of the story and how she felt about the entire ordeal both before and after the incident. She recalled how her intuition was the first sign of warning she received before diving in.\n\n\"I've always had really good intuition about things, and unfortunately, I felt that way about the Olympics.\"\n\nStill, the entire episode of her suffering from twisties, withdrawing from the Olympics, and powering through trolls before finally deciding to make a comeback was a sight to behold. This year, as the Paris Olympics are to take place soon, Biles rose with a new perspective.\n\n\"I never thought I'd be at this phase, still doing it, and I feel very grateful...I get to write my own ending.\"\n\nThe powerful finish has fans in a chokehold on what they could expect to witness both in the documentary and the upcoming Olympics. Meanwhile, Biles has just been on a roll, collecting achievement after achievement, her most recent adventure being her Road to Olympics journey.\n\nWhile it's been four years, and for a senior athlete like Biles, things should've taken time to polish up, she proved to the world why she gained the title of GOAT. Since she added her name to the potential roster for the Olympics, she has outperformed all her fellow gymnasts to shine at championships.\n\nBe it her spectacular performance at the Core Hydration Classics or her ninth World Championships title for the overall category, fans are stunned to see her back in action. Fellow athletes who know her caliber are more than happy to welcome her onboard as one of the most talented seniors to rock the vault. And now that the Olympic trials get closer day by day, people can't wait to see her ace at it.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "radha_iyer@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Radha Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAP Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troll"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/12/fd0a057d-simonebi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665518", "eventUri": "eng-9665518", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The campaign will run across NBC, Peacock, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, TikTok and other channels, per the announcement.\n\nAthleta is turning to its roster of Olympic athletes ahead of the Summer Games to drum up interest in the brand, including with its first TV ad buy. Biles narrates the ad campaign while performing \"gravity defying moves,\" per the press release.\n\n\"We are here,\" Biles says in the campaign. \"We are here for deep breaths and running starts. For bold choices on big stages. For pounding hearts and personal bests. For hearing yourself over the crowd -- and landing in your power. We are here.\"\n\nBiles became an Athleta ambassador in 2021 after serving as a Nike athlete since 2015. As part of the deal, the Olympian has partnered with Athleta on developing products and capsule collections. The partnership with Biles came a couple of years after another high-profile brand ambassadorship: In 2019, Athleta signed Allyson Felix, one of the women who critiqued Nike's treatment of pregnant athletes, as its first sponsored athlete.\n\nAthleta's new ad with Biles builds upon its previous Find Your Movement campaign, an effort aimed at cementing Athleta as a women's empowerment brand that champions all forms of movement. While Ledecky, who signed a five-year deal with Athleta in March, is not featured in the main ad campaign, she will appear in other creative assets tied to the brand's Olympics push.\n\nIn addition to Ledecky and Biles, Athleta's Power of She collective includes other pro athletes like basketball player Monique Billings, figure skater Mariah Bell and softball player Jessica Mendoza, according to the brand's website. The company formed its Power of She collective last year, bringing on 11 brand athletes at once.", "source": {"uri": "retaildive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Retail Dive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariah Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Mendoza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Mendoza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Figure skating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billings,_Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billings, Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Billings, Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.retaildive.com/imgproxy/gAviWdKROPThr0s0TLxRsagymo6fPVq6oAVZI3bvw7A/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0FUSDI0X1NpbW9uZV9TdGF0aWNfRE9PSF8xOTIweDEwODBfb3B0aW9uXzEuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665518", "eventUri": "eng-9665518", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, she was one of the biggest stories leading into the Games. But in sport, as in life, competitions do not always go as planned. And for Simone, the world had a front row seat as her private struggle with mental health exploded on the international stage - forcing her to withdraw from the competition. Since then, Simone has put in the hard work: facing the difficult traumas of her past, learning to manage her mental health, embracing her journey, and in the process, rebuilding her gymnastics from the ground up. Her courage to soar knows no bounds as this summer she plans to return to the Olympic stage once again to do what she's always done - be the best Simone that she can be.

Gymnastics is extremely dangerous, and if Biles had experienced anything off with the coordination of her body and brain, it could have resulted in a catastrophic fall.\n\n\"She really could die -- that's how serious it is,\" sports psychologist Carlin Anderson told DW at the time.\n\nTokyo was Biles' second Olympic Games, so sitting it out didn't impact her overall legacy, but for many athletes, that situation would have been career-ending.\n\nAs Paris 2024 approaches, Northwell Health partnered with Stacker to explore the sports with the highest rates of injuries during the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics, using data from two British Journal of Sports Medicine reports. The data only looks at injuries during the Olympics, not sporting events outside of the Games.\n\nThe pinnacle of most sports is the Olympics -- summer or winter -- and athletes work their entire lives to reach that milestone -- often only attending a handful of Games since they only happen every four years. If an athlete gets injured while competing at the Games and misses their shot to reach the apotheosis of their sport, it can be devasting.\n\nBMX racer Connor Fields and slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo sustained life-threatening and season-ending injuries at the Tokyo and Sochi Olympics, respectively, and were unable to compete.\n\nFor the more dangerous sports, like BMX racing and alpine skiing, medical staff are positioned on the course and have a few seconds to respond to the injured athlete lest things turn tragic.

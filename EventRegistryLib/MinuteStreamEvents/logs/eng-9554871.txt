These forward-looking statements are based on JFrog's current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause JFrog's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.\n\nThere are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release and our earnings call, including but not limited to: risks associated with managing our rapid growth; our history of losses; our limited operating history; our ability to retain and upgrade existing customers our ability to attract new customers; our ability to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities; our ability to integrate and realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions of complementary businesses; risk of a security breach incident or product vulnerability; risk of interruptions or performance problems associated with our products and platform capabilities; our ability to adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology or customer needs; our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate; our ability to successfully integrate technology from acquisitions into our offerings; our ability to provide continuity to our respective customers and realize innovation following our acquisitions; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nJFrog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. JFrog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate JFrog's financial performance. JFrog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. JFrog's non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on JFrog's reported financial results.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as share-based compensation, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nJFrog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) acquisition-related costs; and (4) income tax effects. JFrog defines free cash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing JFrog's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\nShare-based compensation. JFrog utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its shareholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. JFrog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\n\nAcquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include expenses related to acquisitions of other companies. JFrog views acquisition-related costs as expenses that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period.\n\nIncome tax effects. JFrog's non-GAAP financial results are adjusted for income tax effects related to these non-GAAP adjustments and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets, if any. Excluding income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments provides a more accurate view of JFrog's operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP weighted average share count. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss and a non-GAAP income. The non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute the non-GAAP net income per share - diluted are adjusted to reflect dilution equal to the dilutive impact had there been GAAP income.\n\nAdditionally, JFrog's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nJFrog's number of customers with annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog's number of customers with ARR of $1 million or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog defines ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers, so long as JFrog generates revenue from these customers. JFrog annualizes its monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue it would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying it by 12.\n\nJFrog's net dollar retention rate compares its ARR from the same set of customers across comparable periods. JFrog calculates net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the \"Base Customers\"), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the \"Base Quarter\"). JFrog then calculates the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the \"Comparison Quarter\"). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. JFrog then divides total Comparison Quarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. JFrog's net dollar retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters.", "source": {"uri": "investors.jfrog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "investors.jfrog.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DevOps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MLOps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intangible asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synergy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Software", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Consultants", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554871", "eventUri": "eng-9554871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nJFrog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. JFrog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate JFrog's financial performance. JFrog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. JFrog's non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on JFrog's reported financial results.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as share-based compensation, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nJFrog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) acquisition-related costs; and (4) income tax effects. JFrog defines free cash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing JFrog's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\nShare-based compensation. JFrog utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its shareholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. JFrog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\n\nAcquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include expenses related to acquisitions of other companies. JFrog views acquisition-related costs as expenses that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period.\n\nIncome tax effects. JFrog's non-GAAP financial results are adjusted for income tax effects related to these non-GAAP adjustments and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets, if any. Excluding income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments provides a more accurate view of JFrog's operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP weighted average share count. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss and a non-GAAP income. The non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute the non-GAAP net income per share - diluted are adjusted to reflect dilution equal to the dilutive impact had there been GAAP income.\n\nAdditionally, JFrog's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nJFrog's number of customers with annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog's number of customers with ARR of $1 million or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog defines ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers, so long as JFrog generates revenue from these customers. JFrog annualizes its monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue it would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying it by 12.\n\nJFrog's net dollar retention rate compares its ARR from the same set of customers across comparable periods. JFrog calculates net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the \"Base Customers\"), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the \"Base Quarter\"). JFrog then calculates the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the \"Comparison Quarter\"). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. JFrog then divides total Comparison Quarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. JFrog's net dollar retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters.\n\nJFROG LTD.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(in thousands, except per share data;

These forward-looking statements are based on JFrog's current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause JFrog's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.\n\nThere are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release and our earnings call, including but not limited to: risks associated with managing our rapid growth; our history of losses; our limited operating history; our ability to retain and upgrade existing customers our ability to attract new customers; our ability to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities; our ability to integrate and realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions of complementary businesses; risk of a security breach incident or product vulnerability; risk of interruptions or performance problems associated with our products and platform capabilities; our ability to adapt and respond to rapidly changing technology or customer needs; our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate; our ability to successfully integrate technology from acquisitions into our offerings; our ability to provide continuity to our respective customers and realize innovation following our acquisitions; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions.

Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nJFrog discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. JFrog uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate JFrog's financial performance. JFrog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. JFrog's non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on JFrog's reported financial results.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as share-based compensation, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nJFrog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) share-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) acquisition-related costs; and (4) income tax effects. JFrog defines free cash flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing JFrog's operating performance due to the following factors:\n\nShare-based compensation. JFrog utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its shareholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. JFrog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\n\nAcquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include expenses related to acquisitions of other companies. JFrog views acquisition-related costs as expenses that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period.\n\nIncome tax effects. JFrog's non-GAAP financial results are adjusted for income tax effects related to these non-GAAP adjustments and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets, if any. Excluding income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments provides a more accurate view of JFrog's operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP weighted average share count. Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares are the same, except in periods that there is a GAAP loss and a non-GAAP income. The non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute the non-GAAP net income per share - diluted are adjusted to reflect dilution equal to the dilutive impact had there been GAAP income.\n\nAdditionally, JFrog's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nJFrog's number of customers with annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") of $100,000 or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog's number of customers with ARR of $1 million or more is based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. JFrog defines ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers, so long as JFrog generates revenue from these customers. JFrog annualizes its monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue it would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying it by 12.\n\nJFrog's net dollar retention rate compares its ARR from the same set of customers across comparable periods. JFrog calculates net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the \"Base Customers\"), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the \"Base Quarter\"). JFrog then calculates the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the \"Comparison Quarter\"). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. JFrog then divides total Comparison Quarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. JFrog's net dollar retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intangible asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares_outstanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shares outstanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting period"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554871", "eventUri": "eng-9554871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

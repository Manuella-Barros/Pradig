General Pande was to retire from service May 31. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved one-month extension in service of Gen Pande, the defence ministry said. The extension to Gen Pande came nearly five decades after the then Indira Gandhi-led government extended the tenure of Army Chief Gen GG Bewoor by one year in early 1970s in first such instance. In view of extension given to Gen Bewoor, the next in line Lt Gen Prem Bhagat, known to be a fine military officer, retired from service without becoming the Army Chief, according to military experts. \u201cThe Appointments Committee of Cabinet on May 26 approved the extension in service of Chief of the Army Staff Gen Manoj C Pande for a period of one month, beyond his normal age of superannuation (May 31) that is up to June 30 under Rule 16 A (4) of the Army Rules 1954,\u201d the defence ministry said. Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi, currently serving as the Vice Chief of Army Staff, is the senior-most official after Gen Pande. The senior-most official after Lt Gen Dwivedi is Lt Gen Ajay Kumar Singh, the Southern Army Commander. Both Lt Gen Dwivedi and Lt Gen Singh are course mates. Lt Gen Dwivedi, who has vast operational experience along the frontiers with China and Pakistan, assumed charge as Vice Chief in February succeeding Lt Gen MV Suchindra Kumar. Gen Pande took charge as the 29th Chief of the Army Staff April 30, 2022 after Gen MM Naravane retired from service. Before assuming the charge of the top post, Gen Pande was serving as the Vice Chief. He is the first officer from the Corps of Engineers to helm the force. In his distinguished career, Gen Pande also served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, which is India\u2019s only tri-services command. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, he was commissioned into the Corps of Engineers (The Bombay Sappers) in December 1982.

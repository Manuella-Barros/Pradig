Speaking at Kipkok Primary School in Sigowet-Soin Constituency during a fundraiser for the Peace and Mercy Church of Africa, Gachagua emphasized that the Ruto Administration, barely two years in office, needs to avoid premature politics regarding the 2032 elections, which he described as disruptive. \u201cI want to ask our leaders in Kenya Kwanza to drop this agitation. Stop divisive talk and creating factions in our government and focus,\u201d the Deputy President stated. Gachagua urged those eyeing the presidency to wait for the appropriate time. \u201cThe most important business of the day is to ensure President Ruto succeeds. That is my focus and commitment. When people start succession politics of 2032, it causes distraction. I want to ask our leaders to stop; 2032 is very far away, it is unnecessary, it is unhelpful, it is inappropriate, and it is irritating. Let all of us serve the people of Kenya and support the President to succeed.\u201d He reiterated his commitment to supporting President Ruto in discharging his responsibilities and stated he would not be distracted. \u201cWhen President Ruto wanted someone to stand with him, I was there. We campaigned for him. He is a product of our effort; our work is to support him deliver,\u201d the Deputy President added. Gachagua emphasized that there is no time for intense political campaigns when Kenyans are waiting for development, as outlined in the Kenya Kwanza\u2019s Plan pillars. The Deputy President assured that the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) is strong, focused, and intact. He dismissed claims of a crisis meeting called by the President, clarifying that it was a pre-planned meeting to discuss strengthening the party\u2019s development ideology. \u201cOnly the UDA party can set its agenda,\u201d he affirmed. Kericho Senator and Senate Majority Leader Aaron Cheruiyot echoed the Deputy President\u2019s remarks, stating that there is no crisis within UDA. Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng\u00e9no urged other Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders to support the Deputy President and the President for a better Kenya. Kericho County MCAs and Governor Eric Mutai expressed gratitude to the Deputy President for resolving the leadership crisis, noting that peace has been restored. The Governor highlighted the historical allocation of over Ksh 400 billion to counties, which he said would accelerate grassroots development. The Deputy President also reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to sustaining peace along the Kisumu-Kericho border. \u201cI am happy that we have peace here in Sondu. We will establish a General Service Unit Camp to help sustain peace in this area,\u201d he announced. Additionally, Gachagua declared his unwavering stance against illicit brew, drugs, and substance abuse. Other leaders present included area MP Justice Kemei, Woman Representative Beatrice Kemei, and area MCA Erick Bii, among others.", "summary": "<p>Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has called on Kenya Kwanza leaders to halt divisive politics and focus on supporting President William Ruto in delivering on development promises to Kenyans.

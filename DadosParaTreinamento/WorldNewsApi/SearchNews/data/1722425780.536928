Fans were only able to purchase low-alcohol pints when Gareth Southgate\u2019s side took on Serbia in their Group C opener at the Veltins-Arena in the German city on June 16th. Fan group the Free Lions Fan Embassy welcomed the eased restrictions, but is disappointed about some of the other measures set to be in place. \u26bd\ufe0f??????? ? ?????????\ufe0f????? ??????????, ??????????????\ufe0f???? ????, ??:?? ??Back to Gelsenkirchen for the Round of 16, below is a list of key items of information if you are making the trip. ??? ???????\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rwAOG3aupm \u2014 Free Lions (@WeAreFreeLions) June 28, 2024Advertisement \u201cWe are pleased to say that after some lobbying, normal strength beer will be sold, however the sale of alcohol will again be limited to two beers per purchase and there will be NO drinking of alcohol permitted in the stands,\u201d Free Lions posted on X. \u201cWhilst we are happy with the return of normal strength beer, we are disappointed to see restrictions in place limiting the amount of beer you can buy, as well as the ban on drinking in the stands. \u201cBoth added unnecessary pressure on the concourses last time. We don\u2019t see any justification for these measures.\u201d Free Lions also expressed hope there will not be a repeat of the public transport problems endured by fans before and after the Serbia match. Yet the group, which called for an \u201curgent and thorough review\u201d following chaotic scenes as supporters attempted to travel between fan zones, the city centre and the stadium, warned trains, trams and buses are once again likely to be \u201cextremely busy\u201d. Referring to post-match transport, Free Lions posted: \u201cFans will have the option of taking the tram back to the city centre, as was the case last time. \u201cThere will also be shuttle buses to Gelsenkirchen Hauptbahnhof from car park P6 at the stadium. \u201cWe still expect these to be extremely busy, and will communicate if/how long the stadium will be open for after, which may be a good option to allow crowds to die down.\u201d", "summary": "Supporters were only able to purchase low-alcohol pints during England\u2019s previous visit to the Veltins-Arena", "url": "https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/england-fans-to-be-served-normal-strength-beers-during-euro-2024-last-16-match-1643962.html", "image": "https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDZcXFwvMjgyMTU3NTJcXFwvMi43NjUzMTQ5Ni5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NzAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzcwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOl", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:10:39", "author": "BreakingNews.ie,Press Association", "authors": ["BreakingNews.ie", "Press Association"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.347}

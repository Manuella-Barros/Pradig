We reached 1100 Wordles today\u2014huzzah!\u2014and we still have that many to go and change. But what happens when we reach the final word? Does The New York Times game section just start over, reshuffling up all these five-letter words? I think they should add a new wrinkle to the fold, personally, and start a new batch of six-letter Wordles. That would be spicy! That\u2019s still over three years out, of course. With over 1200 Wordle answers remaining, we have close to 3 and 1/3 years left. What will the world look like then? Three years doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but think of how much things changed between 2019 and 2022. The first Wordle\u2014CIGAR\u2014dropped in June 23rd, 2021\u2014three years ago to the day!

Can you solve today\u2019s phrase? Play Now . The Answer: Today's Wordle Screenshot: Erik Kain Wordle Analysis Every day I check Wordle Bot to help analyze my guessing game. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. Wordle Bot reminded me throughout today\u2019s analysis of my guessing game that I picked bad words. The funny thing is, I still got the answer in the same number of guesses as that filthy bot. FLARE was a great opener, leaving me with just 40 remaining words. With a yellow and green box in hand, I started choosing poorly. STYLE only cut 40 down to 13, and WHOLE left me with 6! I just happened to guess BUGLE next. Very lucky! Competitive Wordle Score A wash today. Zero points for guessing in 4 and zero for tying the Bot. Oh well! Could be worse! How To Play Competitive Wordle Guessing in 1 is worth 3 points; guessing in 2 is worth 2 points; guessing in 3 is worth 1 point; guessing in 4 is worth 0 points; guessing in 5 is -1 points; guessing in 6 is -2 points and missing the Wordle is -3 points. If you beat your opponent you get 1 point. If you tie, you get 0 points. And if you lose to your opponent, you get -1 point. Add it up to get your score. Keep a daily running score or just play for a new score each day. Today\u2019s Wordle Etymology The word \"bugle\" has an interesting etymology rooted in history. It comes from the Middle English word \"bugle,\" which referred to a wild ox. This, in turn, was derived from the Old French word \"bugle,\" which also meant a wild ox or a bull. The Old French word came from the Latin word \"buculus,\" which is a diminutive form of \"bos,\" meaning \"ox\" or \"cow.\" The connection to the musical instrument comes from the bugle horn, which was originally made from the horn of a wild ox or a bull. Over time, the term \"bugle\" became specifically associated with the brass wind instrument used in military and ceremonial contexts.

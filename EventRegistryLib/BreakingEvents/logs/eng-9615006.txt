Butker also questioned Biden's devotion to Catholicism.\n\n\"While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique,\" Butker said. \"Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as the growing support for degenerate cultural values in media all stem from the pervasiveness of disorder.\n\n\"Our own nation is led by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make the sign of the cross during a pro-abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro-choice.\"\n\nWhen asked about Butker's attendance last week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters: \"Honestly, what I can say is we invite the entire team and we do that always. I don't have anything beyond that. We invite the team, it's an invitation that goes to the team, and so it's up to the team who comes and who doesn't.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' visit at the White House is scheduled to start at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nButker attended the Super Bowl celebration ceremony at the White House last year, and he was one of the few players -- along with Mahomes, Kelce and pass rusher Chris Jones -- who stood directly behind Biden during the president's remarks about the Chiefs' 2022 season.\n\nFollowing Butker's commencement address, Mahomes said he didn't agree with all of Butker's comments, but considered him a close friend and \"good person.\" Kelce said he didn't agree with \"the majority\" of Butker's speech but \"he's treated friends and family that I've introduced to him with nothing but respect and kindness.\"\n\nLast year, 47 of the 56 Chiefs players who played a snap last season attended. Before the Chiefs accepted Biden's invitation last year, just one of the NFL's past five championship teams -- the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- visited the White House. When former President Donald Trump hosted the 2016 New England Patriots, quarterback Tom Brady and 18 other players chose not to attend.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid acknowledged last year the Chiefs -- after winning Super Bowl LIV -- would've visited the White House in the summer of 2020 if the pandemic wasn't ongoing and had Trump offered an invitation.\n\n\"The one thing I take from this is it doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican or Independent,\" Reid said then. \"It's about unity and the opportunity to come together. I think our guys displayed that. It was a great time.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_merola@nytimes.com", "name": "Lauren Merola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/30211858/GettyImages-1496215644-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615006", "eventUri": "eng-9615006", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

But one person not expected was singer Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nBiden is honoring the Chiefs after their come-from-behind overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl in Las Vegas in February.

She grew up near Philadelphia and attended the game.\n\nKansas City defeated San Francisco to claim the 2020 Super Bowl title.\n\nThe Chiefs shared on social media early Friday that \"we're celebrating our back-to-back championship seasons and victory in Super Bowl LVIII at the White House.\"\n\nKicker Harrison Butker, who made headlines by assailing some of Biden's policies during a commencement speech earlier this month, was expected to accompany his teammates to the White House. Butker recently defended his comments, saying he had no regrets about expressing his beliefs.\n\nIn the May 16 speech at Benedictine College, a private Catholic liberal arts school in Atchison, Kansas, Butker congratulated the women who were receiving degrees and said most of them were probably more excited about getting married and having children. He criticized some of Biden's policy positions, including the Democratic president's condemnation of the Supreme Court's reversal of its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Abortion is an issue that Biden and his fellow Democrats hope to use to their advantage in the November elections.\n\nButker also tackled Biden's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.2 million people in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAs for Swift, her absence was bound to disappoint many in the White House.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was left deflecting questions earlier this week about whether the 34-year-old singer-songwriter would show up.\n\n\"That's a good question,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"I can't speak to her schedule. But I know there's a lot of interest in this building, on this campus.\"\n\nSwift was traveling abroad on her Eras tour, with a show scheduled Thursday in Madrid.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And the Chiefs could be using this visit to measure the curtains, floor space, and check out the kitchen because they come so often, they might as well move in.\n\nThis will be the Chiefs' second consecutive visit to the White House.\n\n(They didn't visit during Covid after winning the Super Bowl in January 2020, and they didn't visit in 1970 after winning Super Bowl IV because White House visits weren't a thing back then.)\n\nAnyway, the headline to come out of Friday's visit should be easy to author: Chiefs Act Like They've Been There Before During White House Visit.\n\nWhat if stuff gets whack because, after all, we're talking about the Chiefs, who don't do anything in merely ordinary fashion.\n\nAnd we're talking about politics and politicians, which are nutty topics in their own right. Or left.\n\nSo let's predict what might happen if this visit gets a little crazy - because crazy is fun.\n\nFirst off, we know the Chiefs will arrive on time. The reason we know this is that Rashee Rice has been named unofficial team chauffeur. And we all know Rice is capable of getting down the road quicker than almost anybody.\n\nThere will be no drug-sniffing dogs on duty at the White House on Friday when the Chiefs arrive. That's because the White House has no concerns about illicit substances, such as cocaine, being on the premises. And the Chiefs seem to prefer pot, anyway.\n\nChiefs kicker Harrison Butker is expected to accompany his teammates despite his stated disagreement with President Biden.\n\nThe President was briefed about Butker's commencement speech when it first happened weeks ago. He has been updated on who has come to Butker's defense and about who is in opposition.\n\nThe President also is scheduled for another briefing about Butker's stances, particularly as it pertains to him, mere minutes before the Chiefs arrive.\n\nBut no worries.\n\nThe President will have forgotten all about Butker's stances by the time he shakes the player's hand...\n\n...Which will happen after someone picks Biden up when he trips.\n\nPresident Biden may understandably believe he's being introduced to a civil war veteran when he meets Butker because, well, have you seen Butker? Dude looks like a Union army major.\n\nAnyway, this is bound to go well because Biden loves meeting his contemporaries.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid has been a gentleman in explaining that his team's visits to the White House are not about making a political statement.\n\nReid has also not been coy about his love for the food catered during the lunchtime visits. The White House menu Friday is expected to meet with the coach's approval.\n\nChiefs players and staff will also be fed something or other once Reid has dispensed with the food.\n\nTo hear President Biden talk, he and Reid go way back. No, really, waaaay back.\n\nBiden is expected to share the story about the time he gave Reid a play-call suggestion for the Super Bowl and Reid used it in a victory. The play, Biden is expected to share, is \"65 Toss Power Trap.\"\n\nBiden will tell the tale about how he recalls telling Reid to \"matriculate the ball down the field\" and then call his suggested play to win the game.\n\nIt's unclear if Reid and the rest of the Chiefs party will bring guests. Biden has told his staff he's eager to have Reid bring his wife because he's one of her biggest fans.\n\nHe simply loves watching Joy Reid on TV.\n\nBiden is expected to keep his comments short so as to move the program along.\n\nBut OutKick has been given a preview of the president's speech (wink).

Mandatory Credit: David Rainey-USA TODAY Sports / David Rainey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Kansas City Chiefs are celebrating a huge championship victory by leaving town to tour the White House and meet with current President Joe Biden.\n\nLast offseason, Kansas City made the trip up to Washington D.C. fresh off a win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII. This time around, Andy Reid's team is heading up there following a Super Bowl LVIII triumph over the San Francisco 49ers. With the club's second OTA session of the offseason in the books and one more on the horizon next week, this is an ideal time for the Chiefs to get away and commemorate a huge accomplishment.\n\nChiefs players, coaches, front office staff and executives are in attendance, as are local political figures and more. President Biden will officially recognize the reigning champs on Friday in a brief on-stage address.\n\nEarlier this week, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo spoke about the overall experience.\n\n\"I always enjoy going,\" Spagnuolo said. \"I've seen it and I've been through there, that part of it. I think every time I've gone, I see something different, whether it's a picture or a painting. I will say this, the people there that are in and around and kind of talk about [things], they're great. You try to grab one of them, they're like your own guide, right?\"\n\nThe White House's official YouTube account has a live stream of the event set up for 3:15 p.m. CT.

It\u2019s only mid-June, he said with annoyance, and until this week he barely needed the air-conditioning in his high-rise apartment on the city\u2019s North Side. When he stopped at McDonald\u2019s, he ordered a large hot coffee out of habit. \u201cWhat am I doing with this?\u201d Mr. White said. He studied the skin on his forearm, already glistening with sweat. \u201cBarely starting the day and I\u2019m getting burned.\u201d A heat wave that is expected to punish much of the country before week\u2019s end enveloped the Midwest, leaving the region scorched and sweltering. In Chicago, beaches were packed by midmorning, and in a stroke of good luck, Monday was the first day that hundreds of city pools, water playgrounds and splash pads opened for the summer.", "summary": "Heat overwhelmed cities across the Midwest and was headed to the Northeast.

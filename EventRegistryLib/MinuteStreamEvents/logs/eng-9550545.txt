(BKPI) is seeking clear guidelines under the Universal Healthcare Act in order not to leave doctors confused about where to submit a disclosure report if they own a pharmacy, laboratory center, or testing center.\n\n\"Ang kailangan lang po ay disclosure pero sa ngayon ay kulang pa o wala pong guidelines paano ba dapat i-disclose ng mga doktor o saan kung meron man siyang shares doon sa isang pharmacy, sa isang hospital, isang pharmaceutical company, o sa publiko. Wala nga pong guidelines,\" said lawyer Dez Perlez, the spokesperson for Bell-Kenz, during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay on Wednesday.\n\nShe reiterated that owning a business as a doctor \"is not illegal,\" as well as prescribing products from Bell-Kenz.\n\nThis developed as BKPI is seeking protection for the medical practitioners against unwarranted accusations. Perlez, legal counsel of BKPI, shed light on the significant impact these accusations have made on the medical community during the weekly forum.\n\nPerlez disclosed during the same event that some doctors now face imminent danger as their security is compromised due to the dissemination of their personal information, including vehicle details and images, on social media platforms. Consequently, legal action is now being explored against those responsible for circulating these defamatory posts. Furthermore, Perlez highlighted that several doctors have received threats to their lives as a result of these online attacks.\n\nClarifying misconceptions, Perlez emphasized that there is no conflict of interest in doctors owning businesses related to their profession. She underscored that existing laws do not prohibit medical professionals from having ownership stakes in hospitals, pharmacies, diagnostic centers, or laboratory clinics.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Luis Raymond Go, President of Bell-Kenz, underscored the unwavering commitment of doctors to prioritize patient care above financial gain.\n\n\"We doctors, our primary goal is not to earn but to serve our patients, meet their medical needs, and help them recover from their illnesses or ailments,\" stated Go. He further reiterated the dedication of doctors to ensure the well-being of their patients, emphasizing his personal involvement in providing pro bono consultations as a cardiologist at the Philippine Heart Center.\n\nIn the same forum, Bell-Kenz Pharma's chief executive officer, Luis Raymond Go, stated that, as a physician, he supports \"whatever law [that] will come out\" following the Senate hearing on April 30.\n\nHowever, during the Senate committee on health hearing over the alleged \"collusion\" of the controversial drug firm and some doctors, Bell-Kenz admitted to only having submitted partial compliance in its reportial requirements to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the financial relationship with doctors.\n\nThe admission caught the attention of the Department of Health (DOH) and FDA.\n\n\"Well, we heard during our Senate hearing that the company invited there itself used the term 'partial compliance,' so we were quite surprised because we were hoping for full compliance,\" said DOH spokesperson Albert Domingo during a radio interview earlier, referring to the admission of Bell-Kenz.\n\nFDA Reminder\n\nWhen the Bell-Kenz issue emerged weeks ago, the FDA immediately issued an announcement to all pharma and other stakeholders on April 26, reminding them of the submission of their financial reports.\n\n\"Pursuant to Section 35 (b) of RA No. 11223 on Ethics on Public Health Policy and Practice, all FDA-licensed manufacturers, traders, repackers, distributor-importers, and distributor-wholesalers of drugs, medical devices, and biological products including vaccines, and medical supplies registered with the FDA are mandated to collect and track all financial relationships with healthcare providers and healthcare professionals and report these to the Department of Health, through the FDA,\" read the FDA reminder signed by Director General Dr. Samuel A. Zacate on April 26.\n\nPossible Administrative Case\n\nThis is why Domingo revealed that during the coordination meeting with the officials from FDA, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), and attended by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) on May 2, they discussed possible actions they would take against Bell-Kenz and other non-compliant pharma companies and other stakeholders.\n\n\"Kasi pag walang parusa, baka hindi tayo sineseryoso,\" Domingo said that non-compliant firms or doctors may face possible administrative sanctions.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Christopher \"Bong\" Go expressed his full support for an extensive and fair investigation into the alleged unethical practices of Bell-Kenz by the Senate blue ribbon committee. Being the Chair of the Senate Health Committee, Go emphasized the importance of upholding the integrity of the medical profession and maintaining the trust given to doctors.\n\nHe stressed the State's obligation to safeguard the integrity of the public health system and ensure that medical professionals adhere to their ethical standards and existing laws.\n\n\"Walang masamang kumita but not at the expense of people's health.

Failure to comply will be considered a violation of Republic Act No. 11223, or the Universal Health Care Act and may lead to penalties.\n\nAside from the Senate, the DOH, FDA, Professional Regulation Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting a joint investigation to hold accountable individuals, including physicians, found to have violated laws and regulations.The DOH noted that there was a conflict of interest in the current setup of Bell-Kenz and its affiliated physicians.\n\nDoctors found to have colluded with the company to prescribe its products, instead of generic drugs, may be penalized for violating the Code of Ethics of the Medical Profession, and RA 9502 (Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act of 2008).\n\nPenalties include fine and imprisonment, plus the revocation of their medical license.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dexter_cabalza@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Dexter Cabalza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime_Prevention_Act_of_2012", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Heart_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Heart Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-level marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Regulation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Regulation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Medicine", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-30-at-12.57.49.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550545", "eventUri": "eng-9550545", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

We need to stop the smooching.\n\nIn the past weeks doctors chat groups have been abuzz with accusations leveled against the pharmaceutical company, Bell-Kenz Pharma Inc., and its incorporators and management who are mostly physicians. The accusations come from a variety of sources, but the most credible source may be a recent hearing held by the Senate Committee on Health and Demography.\n\nThe accusations are alarming. Most egregious is that Bell-Kenz engages in a multi-level marketing scheme that gives doctors rebates that can be substantial, especially for those higher up in the pyramidal chain of doctor/prescribers. Proof of the said paybacks are said to be bank checks, held by Senator Raffy Tulfo, who first denounced the scheme.\n\nAlso circulating in doctor chat groups are brochures, allegedly produced by Bell-Kenz, with diagrams that illustrate the rebate scheme. The brochures, the providence of which I cannot ascertain, talk of jedi and padawans in the hierarchy of investors and sellers. This bit of gossip caused one senator to warn against falling to the dark side in his opening statement.\n\nA second accusation relates to the gifts that Bell-Kenz Pharma apparently gives to the doctors who manage to \"sell\" through their prescriptions. These include luxury cars and watches and lavish foreign trips. Senator Jinggoy Estrada named doctors who, he implied, received luxury cars with brand names like Maserati, BMW, Audi and Mercedes Benz.\n\nLast, but sufficiently grave, is the accusation of conflict of interest. The Senate hearing brought up issues ranging from the over-prescription of drug products of Bell-Kenz, to doctors associated with Bell-Kenz encouraging patients not just to buy the company's products but directing them to buy these from certain pharmacies which they also owned. The very existence of a drug company incorporated by doctors raises red flags. Senator Tulfo has revealed during the hearing that he has a list of doctors involved with Bell-Kenz.\n\nMy difficulty with the Senate held last April 30, 2024 was it was a bit chaotic.\n\nIssues and accusations were made by the senators against Bell-Kenz and were outright denied by its chairman and CEO Luis Go. Relevant government agencies like the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health were also accused of negligence. They often rambled on about peripheral topics and then were cut short.\n\nFollow-ups and exchanges were not allowed much time by the committee chair, Senator Bong Go, whose issue was the non-payment of the health emergency allowance to our COVID frontliners. He wanted to have time for that. Senators were lining up to get in their points, and given the limited time nothing got a thorough airing.\n\nThe Senate hearing could have accomplished far more.\n\nCEO Dr. Go was able to deny or explain away the alleged checks and car sales. As a person who wants to come to an appreciation of the veracity of the accusations, I am frustrated that the list of names, the checks, and car sale receipts never really saw the light of the Senate meeting room. What I witnessed were plausible accusations and plausible denials.\n\nI also did not hear a sober and nuanced discussion of the state of enmeshment of medical doctors with pharmaceutical companies. If you ask me, the profession as a whole stands condemned, the innocent as well as the guilty. This means that we understand why the guilty need to be punished, and what are the levels of guilt and appropriate punishment. It also involves asking why the innocent find it so hard not to be enmeshed. We must also ask how those of us who are innocent can help set up safeguards, voluntary and through new laws, so that we may become more ethical.\n\nAnd, yes, I do want cases to be filed and to begin with Bell Kenz Pharma. Because until we see the profession and its regulators working to uphold ethical standards, the profession is under reputational threat.\n\nThe fundamental trust that we and our patients need in order for us to work together towards health has suffered a blow. At this point, years of missteps and under-the-radar, gray area practices have finally come to fruition. It is not enough for us to say that not all of us are like that. We need to stop the assault now and take this as an opportunity to reset.\n\nI have noticed an opinion writer in one of our broadsheets defending Bell-Kenz Pharma, Inc. The main argument seems to be that it is being singled out and that these charges are being made by a competitor. This is a morally bankrupt argument. The fact that others are doing this is not an excuse for alleged Bell-Kenz's wrongdoing. Furthermore, if these accusations are proven true, this is the most egregious case. So let's begin with them, shall we?\n\nBut investigations and due process must happen prior to the filing of cases.\n\nI suggest therefore that another Senate hearing be called to focus on this issue and that each accusation be given enough time to be discussed. I would be happy for the senators to show the checks they have in hand, the car sale receipts, and other documents, as well as to discuss their provenance. Whistleblowers should also be presented. After this the evidence revealed at the Senate may be sent to the proper regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Board of Medicine may suspend or revoke physicians' licenses. If there is one thing I have concluded, many of the doctors associated with Bell-Kenz Pharma did not disclose fully their conflict of interest to the necessary parties. They did not disclose this to their patients, their hospital administrators or the Board of Medicine. It is enough for me that the term used by CEO Dr. Go was that they were in \"partial compliance\" with disclosure regulations.\n\nWe must also consider that what is in the law is a minimal ethical floor - not the ceiling. And, if there is one professional who must reach for the ceiling, it is the physician. Hence our ancient and famous Hippocratic oath. And so, on the basis of ideal ethics, I ask Bell-Kenz Pharma doctor incorporators: what were you thinking?\n\nAs to Senator Tulfo's distrust of the Board of Medicine, he is welcome to ask the Board to constitute a fact finding group of morally tough, knowledgeable and respected doctors to look into it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration may decide not to renew Bell-Kenz license to operate. Also the Securities and Exchange Commission may refuse registration. Government doctors who have received extravagant gifts may be made to face the Ombudsman. I wonder if a tax audit is in order.\n\nAll this must lead to the enactment of a new law that prohibits doctors from prescribing medications and services provided by entities that have a financial relationship to the doctor or their close relatives.\n\nI call on fellow doctors to begin a long road towards ending our co-dependency on drug companies. We need to stop the smooching. In the short term I think we can refuse those environmentally unfriendly give-aways.\n\nDo you really need another ball pen, baseball cap or paper weight? As a project that will take more time, we should turn our backs on conferences in fancy places, dinners in fancy restaurants, and similar entertainments masquerading as \"continuing medical education.\" Spending time on those things is less time spent going to the theater, eating out or traveling with friends and families on our own funds. These are far more rewarding and are the kind of social relations shown to contribute greatly to better health outcomes anyway.\n\nWe must also strengthen our discipline in bringing critical thinking to what the drug representatives tell us. Our medical training tells us that we must go to peer-reviewed journals and other reputable sources as our main source for guidance. Drug company information and learning activities are to be considered third-class knowledge products.\n\nWith regards to Bell-Kenz Pharma, all doctors should stop prescribing their products. We are ethically obliged to prescribe only the cheapest of all the generic formulations. This would essentially mean not prescribing most Bell-Kenz products. I think doctors who are investors in the company should divest now. It's probably good financial advice, but I am more interested in the ethical aspects of divesting now.\n\nAs a matter of urgency, the best whistleblowers on Bell-Kenz Pharma are likely to be doctors themselves. Please come forward. I suggest to the Senate and the government agency to give these whistleblowers confidentiality and immunity.\n\nLastly I call on the public to help their doctors now. Please remain vigilant about this issue. If you have encountered or know of any violations in relation to Bell-Kenz Pharma, do report it. But also let us not let the issue die down without resolution, as so many other scandals have died down before. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glenda_gloria@rappler.com", "name": "Glenda Gloria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffy_Tulfo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raffy Tulfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinggoy_Estrada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jinggoy Estrada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Codependency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multi-level marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maserati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bong_Go", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bong Go"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadsheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continuing medical education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/05/TL-why-investigate-punish-bell-kenz-pharma-inc-May-6-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550545", "eventUri": "eng-9550545", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Her favorability rating is also underwater at 38-49%, favorable to unfavorable.\n\nThe good news for Hochul is that a plurality of voters in both parties support her decision to halt New York's congestion pricing program, which would have inflicted higher toll fares on commuters to New York City. Voters approve of her decision by 45% to only 23% who disapprove, with 16% staking a position in the middle, according to the poll.\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a statement.\n\nNY'S DEM GOVERNOR INDEFINITELY HALTS CONGESTION PRICING PLAN, PUTTING PARTY OVER CLIMATE\n\n\"Among Democrats, she continues to have a two-to-one favorability rating and even stronger job approval rating, however, she's viewed unfavorably by 81% of Republicans and 61% of independents, while 84% of Republicans and 63% of independents disapprove of the job she's doing as governor.\"\n\nThe Siena College survey also recorded President Biden's lowest-ever favorability in the Empire State, 42%, and found he continues to lead presumptive Republican nominee former President Trump by single digits, 47%-39%.\n\n\"While Biden maintains the support of three-quarters of Democrats, Trump has support from 85% of Republicans and leads Biden 45-28% with independents,\" Greenberg said. \"A gender gap has reopened as men support Trump 46-42% and women favor Biden 51-33%. White voters are evenly divided. And while Biden has a commanding lead with non-white voters, Trump garners support from 29% of Black and 26% of Latino voters.\"\n\n\"Two-thirds of voters say they plan to watch next week's debate between Trump and Biden, the earliest general election presidential debate in memory. It remains to be seen what impact the debate has on the race, but the last time the presidential election was as close as it is now in New York was 1988 when Democrat Michael Dukakis beat Republican George H.W. Bush by only four points, 52-48%. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry New York -- by eight points, 54-46% -- in 1984.\"\n\nNEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS 'CLOWNS' IN HER OWN 'BASKET OF DEPLORABLES' MOMENT\n\nThe congestion pricing plan was set to begin on June 30, but earlier this month, Hochul made the surprise decision to put it on hold, reportedly due to concerns about voter backlash in the upcoming election.\n\nHochul reaffirmed her \"commitment to a greener, more sustainable future\" in a speech announcing her decision on June 5, but she said the move was best for \"the little guy.\"\n\nThe stated goal of congestion pricing in the Big Apple is to get greener by improving air quality and reducing traffic. Politico reported that House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had asked Hochul to consider delaying the unpopular program as he works to capture the House majority in November.\n\nThe GOP managed to reclaim a thin majority in the House two years ago largely due to several key Republican congressional victories in New York.\n\nNYC MAYOR ADAMS SAYS HE SUPPORTS MASK BAN TO CURB CRIME: 'COWARDS COVER THEIR FACES'\n\nThe first-in-the-nation congestion pricing plan was to take effect as New York City transit ridership has taken a nosedive due to public safety concerns. It had received serious blowback from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, former President Trump and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nUnder the transit authority's plan, trucks would be subject to a charge of $24 or $36 per trip, depending on their size. Most drivers in private passenger cars, in contrast, should expect to pay about $15, with lower rates for motorcycles and late-night entries into the city, according to the proposal finalized in March.\n\nRepublican critics have called the plan a tax on commuters. However, left-wing activists criticized Hochul's decision, saying it would deprive the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of needed funding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuburban voters were the strongest group in support of Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing, backing the move by 56%.\n\nThe Siena College survey included 805 registered voters from across New York state reached by landline, cell phone and through an online panel.

Her job approval rating has also dipped to 44%, with 50% disapproving, marking a significant decline from May's 45-46% split.\n\nThe poll revealed that while small pluralities of voters believe Hochul demonstrates honesty and integrity (40-36%) and works hard for the people (42-36%), larger pluralities feel she doesn't care about people like them (44-34%) and lacks decisive leadership (44-36%).\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as Governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said.\n\nApproval of Hochul's performance breaks down significantly by partisan lines.

Kathy Hochul's (D-NY) indefinite pause on congestion pricing, but they may not feel the same about the governor herself, according to a new poll.\n\nA Siena College Research Institute poll found that 45% of registered voters in New York were on board with the pause in congestion pricing, while 23% said they opposed the governor's move. Earlier this month, Hochul \"indefinitely paused\" congestion pricing that was supposed to go into effect June 30 on those who drive below 60th Street in Manhattan.\n\nWhile almost half of New Yorkers are OK with the move, Hochul's approval ratings still dropped, as 38% of voters viewed her favorably and 49% viewed her unfavorably. This is a change from the 46% of those who viewed her unfavorably in May.\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as Governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said.\n\nIn the Democratic Party, however, Hochul's favorability increases to 56%. It's a good sign for the governor as she is up for reelection in 2026.\n\nHer decision to pause congestion pricing was strongest in the New York suburbs, with 56% of respondents in favor and 18% against.

From the 26 demographics of people polled, there was little difference in ideology having a factor in viewing the move as favorable or unfavorable.\n\n\"There's little partisan difference when it comes to Hochul's end-of-session surprise decision to put congestion pricing on hold,\" Greenberg said. \"It is supported by 46% of Democrats, 45% of Republicans, and 43% of independents, all large pluralities.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annabella_rosciglione@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Annabella Rosciglione", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Congestion pricing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College_Research_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP22128739833334.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667822", "eventUri": "eng-9667822", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 497}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Her favorability rating is also underwater at 38-49%, favorable to unfavorable.\n\nThe good news for Hochul is that a plurality of voters in both parties support her decision to halt New York's congestion pricing program, which would have inflicted higher toll fares on commuters to New York City.

It remains to be seen what impact the debate has on the race, but the last time the presidential election was as close as it is now in New York was 1988 when Democrat Michael Dukakis beat Republican George H.W.

KATHY HOCHUL CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS 'CLOWNS' IN HER OWN 'BASKET OF DEPLORABLES' MOMENT\n\nThe congestion pricing plan was set to begin on June 30, but earlier this month, Hochul made the surprise decision to put it on hold, reportedly due to concerns about voter backlash in the upcoming election.\n\nHochul reaffirmed her \"commitment to a greener, more sustainable future\" in a speech announcing her decision on June 5, but she said the move was best for \"the little guy.\"\n\nThe stated goal of congestion pricing in the Big Apple is to get greener by improving air quality and reducing traffic. Politico reported that House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had asked Hochul to consider delaying the unpopular program as he works to capture the House majority in November.\n\nThe GOP managed to reclaim a thin majority in the House two years ago largely due to several key Republican congressional victories in New York.\n\nNYC MAYOR ADAMS SAYS HE SUPPORTS MASK BAN TO CURB CRIME: 'COWARDS COVER THEIR FACES'\n\nThe first-in-the-nation congestion pricing plan was to take effect as New York City transit ridership has taken a nosedive due to public safety concerns. It had received serious blowback from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, former President Trump and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nUnder the transit authority's plan, trucks would be subject to a charge of $24 or $36 per trip, depending on their size. Most drivers in private passenger cars, in contrast, should expect to pay about $15, with lower rates for motorcycles and late-night entries into the city, according to the proposal finalized in March.\n\nRepublican critics have called the plan a tax on commuters. However, left-wing activists criticized Hochul's decision, saying it would deprive the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of needed funding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuburban voters were the strongest group in support of Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing, backing the move by 56%.\n\nThe Siena College survey included 805 registered voters from across New York state reached by landline, cell phone and through an online panel.

Kathy Hochul's surprise last-minute decision to indefinitely pause the congestion pricing toll, according to a new poll.\n\nThe statewide Siena College survey conducted last week also showed Hochul's approval rating hovering at its lowest level in a year, with only 38% of respondents giving her a thumbs up.\n\nAlmost half, 49%, disapproved of her, tied for the second lowest rating ever, set back in April.\n\nOf the statewide respondents, 45% said they supported Hochul's decision to pause the $15 daily toll on drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.\n\nSuburban voters continued to voice the most fierce opposition to the toll, with 56% supporting Hochul's pause. Those voters encompass Long Island as well as Westchester, Putnam and Rockland Counties.\n\nThe poll was conducted last week, just days after lawmakers ended their yearly session in Albany after bucking Hochul's last-minute attempt to raise taxes to make up for revenue the MTA had expected to generate from congestion pricing.\n\nThe decision has led to furious backlash against Hochul from lefty pols.\n\nCity Comptroller and mayoral hopeful Brad Lander is leading a group looking to sue to force Hochul and the MTA to move forward with the plan.\n\nDespite the protests, only 23% of respondents told Siena they opposed the pause.\n\nEarlier this year, even more poll respondents ripped the toll, with 63% saying they opposed or somewhat opposed congestion pricing.\n\nWhile the suburbs may like Hochul's congestion pricing pause, they still aren't showing her as much love with 52% of suburban respondents saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the Governor. That's the same rate as the rest of the state outside New York City.\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as Governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said.\n\nHochul's approval rating lags behind that of President Joe Biden, who got a thumbs up from 42% of those polled.\n\nThe survey included 805 respondents from across the state who were reached by landline, cell phone, and through an online panel.

Kathy Hochul's most high-profile recent actions - yet their rating of the governor has hit an all-time low, according to a new poll released Thursday.\n\nThe Siena College survey found voters - by a 2-1 ratio -- back Hochul's move to put the brakes on new tolls for driving into Manhattan. Support is strong across party, geographic and economic lines, Siena said.\n\nThere's even much greater support for a bill Hochul championed to ban social media companies from sending addictive online feeds to minors without parental consent: 70% of those surveyed back a ban.

That's the worse Hochul has fared on those two questions since she took office in August 2021, Siena said.\n\n\"Among Democrats, she continues to have a two-to-one favorability rating and even stronger job approval rating,\" Siena spokesman Steve Greenberg said. \"However, she's viewed unfavorably by 81% of Republicans and 61% of independents, while 84% of Republicans and 63% of independents disapprove of the job she's doing as governor.\"\n\nA majority of voters agreed with the idea that Hochul \"works hard for the people.\" But Hochul's rating showed a decline in two measures touching on likability.\n\nAsked if Hochul \"cares about people like you,\" the governor went from a plus 8 percentage points in December 2022 to a minus 10 now - an 18-point swing.\n\nAsked if Hochul works collaboratively with others, the governor went from a plus 12 to a plus-3, a 9-point change.\n\nIn other findings, Siena said:\n\nSiena surveyed 805 registered New York voters from June 12-17.

Kathy Hochul's decision to pause Manhattan congestion pricing is supported by a 45% plurality of the state's registered voters, according to a new Siena College Research Institute poll.\n\nDespite their approval of the Democrat governor's decision to indefinitely pause the tolling plan, voters were not impressed by Hochul's overall performance, as her approval numbers slid slightly from the last survey Siena conducted to hit a record low.\n\nTwenty-three percent said they oppose the decision to put the congestion pricing plan on hold, while 16% said they were in the middle on the subject; 17% did not offer an opinion.\n\nHochul's about-face on the plan has rankled progressives, environmentalists, and business leaders, who call it a setback for mass transit funding and air pollution reduction, yet no more than three in 10 of voters polled across 26 demographic categories Siena provided opposed her move. The largest segments of opposition came from Democrats (28%), liberals (30%), New York City voters (30%), and Latinos (33%).\n\n\"There's little partisan difference when it comes to Hochul's end-of-session surprise decision to put congestion pricing on hold,\" Siena spokesperson Steve Greenberg said in a statement to Politico. \"It is supported by 46 percent of Democrats, 45 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents, all large pluralities.\"\n\nSupport for the pause was strongest in the suburbs, where it was backed by 56% of respondents, compared to 18% of suburban residents who were against it. The survey found a sharp divide between men and women, with 52% of men supporting the governor's decision to pause versus 39% of women.\n\nHochul's approval numbers dipped in the latest Siena poll, with just 38% of voters viewing her favorably and 49% viewing her unfavorably. In May's Siena poll, she was viewed favorably by 38% and unfavorably by 46%.\n\nEven as Democrats and left-leaning activists consider mounting a primary challenge over her congestion pricing move when Hochul is up for reelection in 2026, the most recent survey found that she remains popular with 56% of party voters.\n\nThe share of voters who said Hochul \"cares about people like you\" fell from 45% to 34%, while 42% said she \"works hard for the people of New York,\" down from 47%. Thirty-three percent said she \"effectively collaborates with other government leaders,\" which dropped from 40%.\n\nThe poll was conducted June 12-13 and 16-17 and surveyed 805 registered voters in the state of New York.

Kathy Hochul has her lowest-ever favorability rating and lowest-ever job approval rating, according to a Siena College poll of registered New York state voters.\n\nAccording to the poll, Hochul's favorability rating of 38-49% is down a little from 38-46% in May, and her job approval rating of 44-50% is down from 45-46% last month.\n\nSmall pluralities think Hochul demonstrates honesty and integrity (40-36%) and works hard for the people (42-36%), however, larger pluralities say she doesn't care about people like them (44-34%), and doesn't provide decisive leadership (44-36%).\n\nBy 45-23%, voters across party lines support Hochul's end-of-session decision to put the congestion pricing toll plan on hold, with 16% volunteering a position in the middle. An overwhelming 70-12% bipartisan majority says the Legislature was right to pass a bill to ban social media platforms from providing addictive algorithm-based feeds to minors without parental consent.\n\nVoters think the Legislature should have passed both the Plastics Reduction Act, 58-31%, and the Heat Act, 58-26%.\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as Governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a press release.\n\n\"Among Democrats, she continues to have a two-to-one favorability rating and even stronger job approval rating, however, she's viewed unfavorably by 81% of Republicans and 61% of independents, while 84% of Republicans and 63% of independents disapprove of the job she's doing as Governor.\n\n\"When it comes to various Hochul characteristics, the partisan divide remains between Democrats on one side and Republicans joined by independents on the other side,\" Greenberg added. \"Democrats say Hochul cares about people like them, works hard, is a decisive leader, and honest. Republicans and independents don't agree.\"\n\n\"On four attributes, voters give Hochul lower grades now than in December 2022, when she had slightly positive favorability and job performance ratings,\" Greenberg said. \"In the most dramatic example, a year and a half ago, voters said Hochul cared about people like them 45-37%. Now they say she doesn't, 44-34%, a net 18-point drop.\"\n\n\"There's little partisan difference when it comes to Hochul's end-of-session surprise decision to put congestion pricing on hold. It is supported by 46% of Democrats, 45% of Republicans and 43% of independents, all large pluralities. While younger voters were closely divided, older voters supported the hold 49-24%,\" Greenberg said. \"There is even larger bipartisan support for limiting algorithm-based feed to minors, with 66% of Republicans, 69% of independents and 72% of Democrats supporting it.\n\n\"By 51-17%, voters say the recently concluded legislative session didn't succeed in passing laws to improve the quality of life in New York. It's unclear if that's related to the Legislature not passing either the Heat Act or the Plastics Reduction Act, but both are popular with New York voters and they would have liked the Legislature to pass them. Each had the support of two-thirds of Democrats, a majority of independents and a plurality of Republicans,\" Greenberg said.\n\nPresident Biden has a 42-53% favorability rating, down from 45-50% in May, his lowest-ever favorability rating. His job approval rating fell to 45-53%, down a little from 46-51% last month. Former President Trump has a 37-59% favorability rating, down from 39-56% in May. Currently, Biden leads Trump 47-39%, little changed from 47-38% in May, and 47-37% in April.\n\n\"While Biden maintains the support of three-quarters of Democrats, Trump has support from 85% of Republicans and leads Biden 45-28% with independents,\" Greenberg said. \"A gender gap has reopened as men support Trump 46-42% and women favor Biden 51-33%. White voters are evenly divided. And while Biden has a commanding lead with non-white voters, Trump garners support from 29% of Black and 26% of Latino voters.\"\n\n\"Two-thirds of voters say they plan to watch next week's debate between Trump and Biden, the earliest general election presidential debate in memory,\" Greenberg said. \"It remains to be seen what impact the debate has on the race, but the last time the presidential election was as close as it is now in New York was 1988 when Democrat Michael Dukakis beat Republican George H.W. Bush by only four points, 52-48%.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry New York - by eight points, 54-46% - in 1984.\"\n\n\"An overwhelming bipartisan majority of voters, 65%, says decisions made by the U.S. justice system are influenced by politics. Only 18% think the justice system operates without political influence,\" Greenberg said. \"The view that justice system decisions are politically influenced is held by 82% of Republicans, 67% of independents and 57% of Democrats.\"\n\n* Voters continue to favor Democrats for Congress over Republicans, 50-35%, little changed from 49-33% in May. That 15-point lead for Democrats is nearly twice the eight-point lead Biden holds over Trump. Voters give Democrats in Congress a closely divided favorability rating, 45-47%, however, they are very unfavorable towards Republicans in Congress, 29-62%.\n\n* US House Speaker Mike Johnson has 22-39% favorability rating. It was 19-28% in November. House Minority Leader, New York's Hakeem Jeffries has a 34-27% favorability rating, from 32-25% in April.\n\n* New Yorkers continue to support adding constitutional protections for abortion rights, 65-20%, from 64-22% last month, and for transgender rights, 49-32%, from 48-32% last month. Support for a constitutional amendment that protects both abortion and transgender rights remains high, 59-27% (59-26% in May).\n\n* Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has a 40-31% favorability rating, little changed from 39-32% last month. Currently, 42% say they would vote to re-elect Gillibrand this year, while 42% say they would prefer 'someone else,' compared to 39-41% in May.\n\n* After completing this year's session, voters give the Assembly a 36-37% favorability rating, compared to 35-38% in April, and give the Senate a 38-39% favorability rating, up a little from 37-42% in April.\n\n* Voters overwhelmingly continue to say the recent influx of migrants to New York is a serious problem, with 83% saying it's a very (57%) or somewhat (26%) serious problem, a consistent view for nearly a year.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Congestion pricing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirsten Gillibrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dukakis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Kathy Hochul's decision to pause congestion pricing as to oppose it, but tend to disapprove of her leadership more generally, according to a new statewide poll from Siena College.\n\nThe poll found that 45% of registered voters said they approved of the governor's move to pause the toll, which was scheduled to go into effect on June 30 and would charge most motorists $15 to enter lower Manhattan, with proceeds funding mass transit improvements. That's nearly twice the 23% of respondents who said they opposed the move, while 33% said they were somewhere in the middle or had no opinion.\n\nAbout 63% of respondents had told Siena they opposed the toll when the question was last asked in April, with 25% supporting it at the time.\n\nSupport for the pause appeared similar between Democrats, Republicans, and independents. In New York City, 45% of respondents said they supported the pause, while 30% opposed it; suburban voters backed the pause even more overwhelmingly, with a majority of those polled (56%) in favor and just 18% against.\n\nRumors have abounded that Hochul decided to pursue the pause in a gambit to retake House seats in suburban districts where the toll is unpopular, though the governor has denied this and claimed she did it out of concern for the economy and hitting New Yorkers' pocketbooks.\n\nOn that front, though, New Yorkers tend to be less supportive of congestion pricing the richer they get, according to the poll.\n\nJust 32% of New Yorkers making less than $50,000 per year support the pause, while 43% of those making between $50,000 and $100,000 support it. At higher incomes above $100,000 annually, 55% of New Yorkers support the pause.\n\nOlder New Yorkers are also more likely to support the pause than younger ones, while white New Yorkers have higher favorable numbers for the pause than Latinos and African-Americans.\n\nDespite apparently favoring the pause she implemented, voters are not so keen on Hochul herself.\n\nJust 44% of registered voters said they approve of Hochul's job performance, compared to 50% who disapprove.\n\nVoters are more likely than not to think Hochul works hard for the people of New York, effectively collaborates with other government leaders, and demonstrates honesty and integrity.\n\nBut they also think she \"does not care\" about people like themselves and doesn't provide New Yorkers with \"decisive leadership.\"\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as Governor,\" said Siena pollster Steven Greenberg.\n\nThe Siena poll surveyed 805 registered voters statewide; it has a margin of error of +/- 4.1%.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_brachfeld@amny.com", "name": "Ben Brachfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Congestion pricing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53377766631_ca2f9f4d6d_k.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667822", "eventUri": "eng-9667822", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 539}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Kathy Hochul - with more than half of sampled voters saying they believe the country and state are headed in the wrong direction.\n\nThe survey of 805 registered New York State voters showed scant positive news for the incumbent Democrats. Biden led his presumptive Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, by a percentage of 47 to 39. And Hochul's proposal to crack down on social media algorithms to safeguard children, which she is expected to sign into law on Thursday, yielded approval from 70% of voters surveyed.\n\nBut overall, the positives for Biden and Hochul were few and far between in the poll of voters in the strongly Democratic state. Fifty-two percent of voters said they believed the state was headed in the wrong direction, with 37% saying they believe it is on the right track. Sixty-one percent of voters - including 47% of Democrats sampled - said they believed America was headed in the wrong direction, with 31% voicing the opposite view.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Fewer than one-third of voters (28%) and fewer than half of Democratic voters (48%) said Trump's recent conviction in Manhattan on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records made them more likely to vote for Biden. Another 37% said it had no impact on their November vote.\n\nSixty-six percent of voters said they planned to watch the June 27 debate between Biden and Trump. Their interest in watching Biden and Trump trade arguments did not translate into either candidate emerging with resounding popularity.\n\nFifty-three percent of voters gave an unfavorable view of Biden, with 42% - the president's lowest rating yet - voicing a favorable view. It topped Trump's 37 favorability percentage, with 59% of voters giving Trump an unfavorable view. The poll showed 53% of voters disapproved of the job Biden has done as president; 45% approved.\n\nSome 49% of voters voiced an unfavorable view of Hochul, a Hamburg Democrat, in her first elected term. Another 38% gave the governor a favorable view. Fifty percent of voters disapproved of the job Hochul has done as governor, while another 44% voiced approval. The favorability and approval rates tie record lows for Hochul, according to the poll.\n\nAmong Democrats, Hochul had a 56% favorability rate, with 28% expressing an unfavorable view.\n\nFewer than half of voters polled (42%) said they believed the governor works hard for the people of the state, that she provides New Yorkers with decisive leadership (36%) and demonstrates honesty and integrity (40%). More voters supported (45%) than opposed (23%) Hochul's recent decision to pause a congestive pricing plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City. Nearly half of those sampled (49%) said they believe crime has gotten worse in the state over the last year. And 83% said they believe the influx of migrants into New York is a serious problem.\n\n\"Despite strongly supporting Hochul's decision to put congestion pricing on hold, and even more strongly supporting the social media bill she championed, voters now give Hochul the lowest favorability and job approval ratings she's had in nearly three years as governor,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a statement.\n\nThe poll asked voters if they believe Hochul \"does not care about people like you.\" Thirty-four percent answered yes, marking a 10-point drop from 44% in a December 2022 Siena poll. And 44% answered no, an eight-point hike from 37% in December 2022.\n\nThe poll showed only 17% of voters said they believed the State Legislature, in its recently concluded session, passed laws to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers. Sixty-five percent of voters supported a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in the state, and another 49% supported an amendment to protect transgender rights.\n\nThe poll sampled a group of Democrats (49%), Republicans (22%) and Independents/Others (29%) between June 12 and June 17. Voters, who were 54% female, 45% male, included 35% from upstate. Sixty-seven percent were white, 15% Black and another 11% Latino.\n\nA spokesman for Hochul could not be immediately reached.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

The poll surveyed 805 New York State registered voters from June 12 to June 17.\n\nOn Hochul's actual job performance, 50 percent of total voters said they disapproved of the job she's doing while 44 percent said they approved. This marks her lowest job-approval rating since she took office in 2021, according to the pollster.\n\nVoters seemed to agree with Hochul on one thing: congestion pricing. Forty-five percent of New York voters said they supported the governor's decision to put the program on hold; 23 percent opposed it.

He says there's a general sense of unease and dissatisfaction on other issues, like crime, the influx of migrants into the state, inflation, and the future of democracy. More than half of New Yorkers think the state and the country are headed in the wrong direction, he said.

Just look at the independent voters.", "body": "INDEPENDENCE DAY: There's a lot to be worried about if you're a Democrat in New York, based on our read of the Siena College poll that went out this morning.\n\nThe figures indicate trouble for the party's chances of retaking the House, and for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who plans to seek reelection in 2026.\n\nToday's poll numbers show that Hochul's favorability rating is lower than it's ever been -- a gloomy 38 percent. Her job approval is also the worst it's ever been, at 44 percent. And President Joe Biden is only beating former President Donald Trump by 8 points, a far cry from the 23-point victory he boasted over Trump in New York in 2020. Yikes.\n\nDeeper in the data is another set of numbers that spell trouble for Democrats come November: independents and others not enrolled in either major party (like former Green Party or Libertarian voters). It's the second largest voting bloc in the state, at about 3.4 million voters (more than Republican, Conservative and Working Families Party voters combined). And they're not happy with Democrats.\n\n\"We used to have Democrats here, Republicans there and independents would be somewhere in the middle range,\" Greenberg said. \"Now you look at a lot of the questions, what you see now is independents are much closer to Republicans than they are to Democrats.\"\n\nDemocrats need those voters if they want to regain control of the House through a state where an estimated six House seats are in play.\n\nIt's also a crucial voting bloc for Hochul as she looks toward reelection after defeating Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin by just five points two years ago.\n\n\"That should be terrifying to our poor candidates; it's such a huge delta,\" former Nassau County Executive Laura Curran, a Democrat, said of the independent voting numbers in the recent poll. \"Abortion will only take you so far and threats to democracy -- people don't feel like that's real.\"\n\nThe tally showed that only 28 percent of independents or voters not belonging to either major party viewed Hochul favorably, and 71 percent disapproved of the job Biden is doing as president. In a head-to-head, Trump wins with that group 45-28 in New York.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news for Hochul, though. New Yorkers overwhelmingly supported her bill to restrict social media's impact on kids, and a plurality of all voters, 45 percent, approved of her congestion pricing pause (though neither party saw a majority of its voters supporting the move).\n\nThe poll now has Republicans circling the waters come November.\n\n\"It's no surprise that New York Democrats' support for open borders, higher taxes, cashless bail, and congestion pricing has resulted in a collapse of support from independent voters,\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, who flipped a Hudson Valley seat red in 2022, told Playbook in a statement.\n\n\"Now, more than ever, New Yorkers want common sense and reasonable policies, which is why Republicans are poised to win in swing districts all across the state.\" -- Jason Beeferman\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA LAWS SIGNED: Hochul today signed into law the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation for Kids act, which will prohibit social media companies from providing children under 18-years-old with addictive feeds without parental consent. The legislation will instead require social media feeds for minors include only content followed by the young users and content must be presented in chronological order.\n\nHochul also signed the New York Child Data Protection act, a bill that prohibits websites from collecting or selling minors' data without parental approval.\n\n\"Other state's should start paying attention to New York, even our Surgeon General called this [legislation] out at the federal level,\" Hochul said in her remarks.\n\n\"We are not only leading the nation, but other states have been watching us and are going to take this bill and bring it to their state, so that eventually this will be the law of the land,\" New York State United Teachers president Melinda Person said.\n\nState Attorney General Tish James said the new law will likely face opposition, as it did prior to its passage, from social media groups that lobbied to delay it.\n\n\"Tish James loves litigation and Tish James is not afraid to stand up to any bully,\" she added, referring to potential legal pushback. -- Katelyn Cordero\n\nIRC STICKING AROUND: New York's new Independent Redistricting Commission is planning to remain in existence in some form for the remainder of the decade.\n\nCommissioners have interpreted the constitutional language that created the commission to mean it doesn't wither away once maps are finalized. They're budgeting $900,000 to stay afloat this year, with a focus on producing a report to lawmakers about how New York's first go-around with the new process went.\n\n\"That'll be carefully done and carefully researched, and we will expect to see a work product by the end of the year or sometime next year,\" GOP Chair Charlie Nesbitt said.\n\nThe first time with the new redistricting rules was certainly a bumpy experience. Five major court cases have led to multiple changes in the congressional and state legislative maps since the commission released its first draft in 2022. -- Bill Mahoney\n\nENVIRONMENTAL GOALS LEFT BEHIND: Lawmakers and environmental advocates in Albany had clear environmental goals they wanted to achieve this legislative session. They went home accomplishing virtually none of them.\n\nNone of the major elements of the state's plan to slash emissions 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 were acted on this year. Measures to reduce plastic packaging, begin plans to transition buildings off gas and mitigate vehicle traffic all ended up failing.\n\n\"What we're seeing is just basic climate indifference,\" Eunice Ko, the deputy director for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance told POLITICO Pro. \"Partly what we're seeing is an overemphasis, I think, on affordability from the governor and the Legislature.\"\n\n\"I would argue affordable for who,\" Ko added. \"You can subsidize suburban people, I guess, but won't be willing to subsidize caskets in the Bronx when people are dying from extreme heat.\"\n\nPOLITICO Pro's New York energy and environment reporter Marie French took a look at what the lack of progress this session means for the state's climate goals and how reducing emissions and achieving climate law mandates remains elusive.

Pat Ryan, of Kingston, introduced legislation with his fellow Democratic House colleagues to eliminate an 1873 federal law the Democrats fear a second-term President Trump could use to implement a national abortion ban.\n\nSome anti-abortion proponents say the 19th-century Comstock Act law could enable them to enact a federal abortion ban without needing to pass any new legislation.\n\n\"This is a hidden ticking time-bomb that must be immediately defused,\" Ryan said in a statement.\n\nToday he and five fellow House Democrats introduced the \"Stop Comstock Act,\" which resembles a measure introduced today by Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith.\n\nRyan also claimed that Trump has a \"detailed playbook to weaponize an archaic law from 1873 that would impose a nationwide abortion ban,\" referencing a New York Times article that showed a person close to Trump was intent on using the law should Trump become president again -- but the former president previously stated he intends to keep abortion up to the states.\n\nTrump said in April that it should be \"up to the states to do the right thing\" on abortion, while painting Democrats as \"radical\" on the issue. -- Jason Beeferman\n\n-- SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY: Harlem residents are fuming after the indefinite pause on congestion pricing means Second Avenue subway extension plans have been axed.

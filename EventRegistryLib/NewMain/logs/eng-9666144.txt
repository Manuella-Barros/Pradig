Chicago may need to make room for DeRozan's re-signing by shopping Zach LaVine, who is on a large salary. The Bulls are in a precarious financial situation but must retain DeRozan to avoid a rebuild and maintain competitiveness.\n\nDeMar DeRozan is one of the top free agents available on the market this summer, though he may not be on the market for long, with journalist Mark Medina arguing that he cannot see any situation unfolding whereby the six-time NBA All-Star doesn't remain with the Chicago Bulls going forward.\n\nRoster Overhaul Incoming? Zach LaVine may be shopped to afford extension with DeRozan\n\nAfter yet another sub .500 season outing which ended in a disappointing Play-In tournament elimination, personnel changes could be on the horizon for the Bulls.\n\nHaving tried - and failed - to shop Zach LaVine at the trade deadline last season, all signs point to Chicago being poised to make a trade involving the two-time All-Star, if they can find a suitor, of course.\n\nThe L.A. Lakers were a team thought to have held interest in the 29-year-old last time out, but now it seems \"unlikely\" that they will pursue the talented Bulls guard this time around due to concerns over LaVine's tethered injury history, which saw him suit up only 25 times during the 2023-24 campaign, and has made his market perhaps more limited than ever.\n\nLaVine's possible departure may also be as a result of the Bulls' keen interest in re-signing six-time All-Star, DeMar DeRozan.\n\nChicago Bulls - 2024-25 Payroll Projection\n\nPlayer\n\nSalary Cap Hit (millions)\n\nZach LaVine\n\n$43.0\n\nLonzo Ball\n\n$21.4\n\nNikola Bucevic\n\n$20.0\n\nCoby White\n\n$12.0\n\nAlex Caruso\n\n$9.9\n\nThe 34-year-old is out of contract this summer, but there is thought to be mutual interest between player and team in remaining together going forward, though only if they are able to do so for a \"reasonable commitment\", with the Los Angeles Clippers waiting in the wings should a deal not materialize, having expressed interest in the veteran should Paul George leave in free-agency.\n\nBut, with the Bulls ranking 25th in the NBA in cap space, in which they are $80 million over the cap, they would have to create some space in order to re-sign the veteran.\n\nAnother player who Chicago looks keen to keep hold of is Alex Caruso , with recent reports surfacing that claim they rejected a top-10 pick for the guard as they felt he was integral to them being able to \"compete for the playoffs\", and with Lonzo Ball also expected to play some part of the 2024-25 season after two years out with injury, things could be looking very different in the Windy City from next season.\n\nDeRozan wants to 'end his career' with the Bulls\n\nMedina spoke with DeRozan during the 2023-24 campaign, and discussed, at length, the 34-year-old's plans for the future, where he stated that he would prefer to stay in Chicago to see out his professional career - something which appears to be mutual with the organization.\n\nThis comes despite some feelings that he'd maybe have liked to have made the move to his hometown Los Angeles at some point in his career, though when chances did present themselves to join the Lakers, he chose to go elsewhere.\n\n\"I think he's still stays with the Bulls. Before the season started, he told me that 'the Bulls, that's the place I want to be and end my career'.\n\nI know that he would love to be back in L.A., but he had different opportunities to be in L.A. and it just didn't happen, and part of it was his own choosing. So, I think the same thing is going to happen here.\n\nAlso, it's going to be about what kind of teams have cap space, and the Lakers have a little bit more cap space, but not a lot. Ultimately, he's going to wind up staying put with Chicago, and for better and worse, Chicago hasn't been comfortable just blowing this thing up and starting over.\n\nSo, I think that what they're going to do is just try to maintain status quo and improve on the margins, and with that, they're going to wind up re-signing DeMar.\"\n\nAging Like a Fine Wine Led the Bulls in scoring last season with 24.0 PPG\n\nThirty-four-year-old swingman DeRozan was one of the most available players for the Bulls this season, in which he joined Andre Drummond and Coby White as the only players to have played 79 of the 82 regular season games.\n\nThere, he was once again a scoring menace, and was the only player on the roster to average over 20 points per game this season, averaging 24.0 points at an efficient 48.0 percent from the field, while also the second-most efficient free throw shooter, in which he converted 85.3 percent of his 4.1 attempts per contest.\n\nHe also led the team in assists, notching 5.3 per game, while also averaging 4.3 boards and 1.1 steals.\n\nDeMar DeRozan - Stats with Bulls\n\nCategory\n\n2023-24\n\nCareer with Bulls\n\nPPG\n\n24.0\n\n25.5\n\nRPG\n\n4.3\n\n4.7\n\nAPG\n\n5.3\n\n5.1\n\nFG%\n\n48.8\n\n49.6\n\n3PT%\n\n33.3\n\n33.6\n\nHaving made his name in the NBA for being one of the most devastating mid-range scorers, it comes as no surprise that most of his shot attempts this season came from there this season, in which he attempted 6.9 shots on average, converting with 43.0 percent efficiency.\n\nThe next most-common shooting zone was in the restricted area, where he attempted 3.8 shots per game, and was most efficient there, converting at 64.8 percent accuracy, and in the paint, where he shot 51.4 percent from his 3.5 attempts.\n\nAll in all, DeRozan has been hugely valuable to Chicago since he joined the team in 2021, and he has shown he is still more than capable of leading the team on the offensive front as they potentially seek to enter a new era of Bulls basketball.\n\nAs such, it is imperative that the Bulls re-sign their leading talisman, or they risk entering a rebuild and having to start all over from square one.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Statmuse, ESPN, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.\n\nRelated Brandon Ingram Could Be a 'Really Good Fit' for Hawks, Sixers\n\nIt

But the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement lengthened the runway for teams, allowing them to begin negotiations with their own free agents the day after the last game of the NBA Finals. Previously, this wasn't allowed until June 30, if teams were playing by the books. That meant the Bulls gained more than two weeks of a negotiation period with their top offseason target.\n\nThe free-agency moratorium doesn't officially end until July 6, when teams will be free to ink deals with free agents. But for teams like the Bulls, who are seeking to re-sign free agents like DeRozan, most of the work to get those deals done will be accomplished in the next two-and-a-half weeks.\n\nThe Bulls are now in the same position they've occupied for nearly a full calendar year: attempting to finalize a deal with DeRozan.\n\nDeRozan has been insistent on his intention to remain in Chicago. But for a brief moment after the Bulls' play-in tournament loss in Miami for the second year in a row, it seemed like he could have a change of heart.\n\nIn a muted postgame press conference, he acknowledged the reality of his age, the weight of making decisions for his family and the desire to chase down an elusive championship. And it was clear that three years of falling short with the Bulls -- not just of a ring, but of any level of playoff competition -- was beginning to take its toll. But barely a month later, DeRozan was back to emphasizing his love of Chicago and desire to re-sign with the Bulls during an interview on Lou Williams' Run It Back podcast.\n\n\"It's definitely a place I would love to return to and take care of unfinished business,\" DeRozan said on the show.\n\nMessaging from executive vice president of basketball operations Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas and the Bulls front office has remained similarly consistent. The Bulls love DeRozan. They want him in Chicago. They see him as a key to the next stage of success for the team.\n\nAnd with all this in mind, they could have re-signed DeRozan at any point during the past year. So why haven't the two parties reached an agreement? The issue, of course, comes down to price.\n\nDeRozan dodged conversations about the specifics of negotiations during the season, but joked at the trade deadline that he viewed the conversations as a back-and-forth talk akin to a romantic squabble.\n\n\"It's kind of like with your spouse,\" DeRozan said. \"It's like, 'What do we need to do to work on this, baby? Let's figure this thing out. You want me. I want you.' The love is there.\"\n\nThe Bulls were in a similar situation last summer as they approached free agency with Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107 -- an aging All-Star who was likely most highly valued in Chicago, plus a mutual desire for nothing to change. But Vu\u010devi\u0107's negotiation was more open and shut simply due to his salary. His three-year, $60 million deal, while perhaps slightly over market value, did not operate as a hindrance for the Bulls. And coming off a four-year, $100 million deal previously signed in Orlando, Vu\u010devi\u0107 took a slight salary dip that reflected a decline in his production.\n\nDeRozan is on much different footing. After completing a three-year, $81.9 million contract with the Bulls, he is eligible to sign a contract worth up to $129.7 million over three years. That ceiling is unlikely to be reached as the Bulls have shied away from three-year options, but the front office still reportedly floated a two-year deal worth up to $40 million - nearly a 46% increase from his prior contract.\n\nFor a team still struggling with the albatross salaries of Lonzo Ball and Zach LaVine, taking a leap on any player is a major risk. The new CBA will give the Bulls a bit more wiggle room on all three salaries, but the front office is still at risk of entering the luxury tax -- and that's previously been a line ownership has only crossed for a guaranteed top-four finish in the East. This would likely mean making sacrifices in other areas, such as giving up on a future with Patrick Williams, who entered his first free agency this summer.\n\nDeRozan's longevity is undeniable: he's only the sixth player in NBA history to average at least 24 points and five assists at 34. But a long-term, high-cost investment in a player who will turn 35 in August doesn't align with the changes the Bulls have articulated following a second year of missing the playoffs.\n\nDeRozan himself has to be clear about the stakes in setting his next deal, as it could be one of the last contracts he signs in the NBA. The Bulls have not been close to playoff-ready for two seasons. Even with a savvy draft pick and LaVine back on the court this season, it's unlikely this team would rise to meet the level of the world-beater Celtics squad that just took home a trophy. And if the Bulls did shake out a more team-friendly deal, it would be a natural question for DeRozan to wonder \"could I get this salary and a ring somewhere else?\"\n\nThe future might seem inevitable for DeRozan and the Bulls, but there's plenty of work to be done to transform those words into an inked contract. It's time to get back to the drawing board -- and the negotiations table -- for both sides.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_poe@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Julia Poe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Vu\u010devi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lou Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art\u016bras_Karni\u0161ovas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_LaVine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach LaVine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CTC-DEMAR-0619.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 545, "textEnd": 552}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 752, "textEnd": 758}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Ron Harper bought into a new role with the Bulls, achieving success upon arrival from the Clippers in 1994. Pau Gasol was a surprising signing for the Bulls in 2014, but he had two successful seasons in Chicago. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have been one of the most popular sports teams in the world since Michael Jordan stepped on the court. As a result, they've had the best attendance in the league for multiple seasons since the 1990s.\n\nHowever, that hasn't been enough to sway free agents when the off-season comes calling. While the situation may have improved in the last decade or so, Chicago is still not the first priority for the big names in free agency.\n\nDespite that, the Bulls' front office has managed to find steals over the years who have helped bring success to the team. These are five of the best players who arrived in the Windy City in free agency.\n\n1 DeMar DeRozan (2021) Contract: 3-years, $85 million\n\nDuring the 2021 off-season, DeMar DeRozan was rumored to join his hometown team, the Los Angeles Lakers, on an MLE. He was willing to take a discount to go back home while being able to play with his former Eastern Conference rival, LeBron James. However, the Bulls swooped in with an irresistible offer and made DeRozan their biggest free-agency acquisition ever.\n\nDeMar DeRozan - Chicago Bulls Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPPG\n\n25.5\n\nRPG\n\n4.7\n\nAPG\n\n5.1\n\nFG%\n\n49.6%\n\n3PT%\n\n33.6%\n\nThe Bulls went all out that off-season as they also brought in Lonzo Ball after trading for Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107 earlier in the year. With DeRozan as their leader, the new-look Bulls took everyone by surprise and were atop the Eastern Conference to start the season. However, an injury to Ball midway through the season followed by periodic injuries to other players hurt them. They managed to finish as the sixth seed, led by DeRozan's career-best season, which got him his most recent All-NBA selection.\n\nThe Bulls became a lottery team in the following two seasons, but DeRozan's play has been one of the few consolation prizes since then. He also managed another All-Star selection last year, his second in the Windy City.\n\nDeRozan will be an unrestricted free agent in the upcoming off-season and the Bulls are reportedly doing their best to bring him back.\n\n2 Ron Harper (1994) Contract: 5 years, $19.2 million\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Clippers refused to pay Ron Harper a five-year $20 million contract to continue his stay, he went to a team that did it happily. The Clippers' loss was the Bulls' gain, who needed a boost in their backcourt after Jordan retired for the first time in the previous year.\n\nIn his last season for the Clippers, Harper averaged 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 1.9 steals per game. But once he arrived in Chicago, Harper was a completely different player. He had a talk with coach Phil Jackson in the off-season about buying into a new role with the Bulls and being part of a triangle offense, among other things. Harper, who couldn't be the same explosive player he was because of injuries towards the end of his Clippers career, bought in and became a part of history after that.\n\nRon Harper - Chicago Bulls Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPPG\n\n7.9\n\nRPG\n\n3.0\n\nAPG\n\n2.6\n\nSPG\n\n1.3\n\nFG%\n\n43.2%\n\nJordan returned halfway through the 1994-5 season, and although they didn't win the title that year, the Bulls had their second three-peat of the decade right after that. Harper played 350 games in five seasons in Chicago, before moving to the Lakers in 1999.\n\n3 Pau Gasol (2014) Contract: 3 years, $22.3 million\n\nThe Bulls wanted Carmelo Anthony in the 2014 free agency but had to settle for a 34-year-old Pau Gasol. And that was likely the better outcome. The Spaniard was a force on the glass for the Bulls and finished with the second-most blocks in the Eastern Conference in his first season. Both feats would not have been possible for Anthony, and despite all the wining and dining they did in free agency for the former Syracuse star, Gasol's fit made a lot more sense.\n\nPau Gasol - Chicago Bulls Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPPG\n\n17.6\n\nRPG\n\n11.4\n\nAPG\n\n3.4\n\nBPG\n\n2.0\n\nFG%\n\n48.3%\n\nWhile the Blues definitely benefited from acquiring him, the move was arguably more important for the Spaniard. It looked like he was headed towards a lesser role after leaving the Los Angeles Lakers, but his career was rejuvenated after the move. For the first time in four years, he was part of both the All-Star and the All-NBA teams. He also had his career high in points, assists, and blocks during his short time with the Bulls.\n\nGasol's stint with the Bulls lasted just two seasons after the Spaniard declined his third-year option citing health issues, and left in 2016 for the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n4 John Paxson (2014) Contract: 3 years, $500K\n\nJohn Paxson has spent over 30 years with the Bulls. First, as a player when he arrived in 1985 as a free agent. His next stint was as an assistant coach under Phil Jackson post his retirement for a brief period, before joining the broadcast team. Then in 2003, he became the GM and was part of the front office until 2020, when the Bulls hired Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas to take over his duties, while Paxson was made a senior advisor to basketball operations.\n\nJohn Paxson - Chicago Bulls Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPPG\n\n7.6\n\nAPG\n\n3.7\n\nSPG\n\n0.7\n\nFG%\n\n50.0%\n\n3PT%\n\n36.3%\n\nWhile his front office career has been forgetful, Paxson's contribution on the court was crucial to the Bulls' first three-peat. After being a bench player in his first four seasons in Chicago, Paxson was promoted to the starting lineup from the 1989-90 season. In the following season, the Bulls won their first-ever title. His most memorable moment in a Bulls jersey came during Game 6 of the 1993 NBA Finals when he hit the game-winning three to clinch Chicago's third straight title.\n\nPaxson played another season after the three-peat but was forced to cut his career short at 33 after repeated knee injuries.\n\n5 Carlos Boozer (2010) Contract: 5 years, $82 million\n\nThe 2010 Free Agency led to the Miami Heat assembling the Big Three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. There was a chance that they could've made that linkup in Chicago, with James and Wade reportedly interested. Unfortunately for the Bulls, they signed with the Heat. So, with all the cap space they created, the Bulls brought in Carlos Boozer on a massive contract.\n\nCarlos Boozer - Chicago Bulls Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPPG\n\n15.5\n\nRPG\n\n9.0\n\nAPG\n\n2.0\n\nFG%\n\n49.1%\n\nThe former Duke standout was past his best by the time he got to Chicago. But he was a key part of the 2010-11 team that finished with 62 wins, the best team that the Bulls had since the Jordan era.\n\nDespite his flaws, the biggest being the contract which was not his fault, Boozer was a rock-solid power forward in the four seasons he spent in Chicago. In the 2014 off-season, the Bulls released him via the amnesty clause, which was also the last time a team used that provision.\n\nRelated 5 Best Players Who Never Made the NBA Finals Among the NBA's Top 75 hides a devastating secret: not all of them have played for the league's ultimate prize.

My stance on wanting to be here is still the same but I just want to win.\"\n\nDeRozan was the ninth pick in the 2009 NBA Draft out of USC.\n\nIn addition to the Bulls, he has also spent time with the San Antonio Spurs and Toronto Raptors over 15 seasons.\n\nThe best tenure of his career came with Toronto.\n\nAs for the Bulls, they are coming off a year where they were the ninth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 39-43 record.\n\nThey lost to the Miami Heat in the play-in tournament.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3454,h_1942,x_430,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01j0pnmpp3aaryw1mwkf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-19", "textStart": 856, "textEnd": 864}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They have resisted that path. DeRozan is finishing a three-year, $81.9 million contract. He is eligible to sign a three-year, $129.7 million contract extension before June 30, per ESPN's Bobby Marks on June 14.\n\nBut Marks - who spent years as an executive with the Brooklyn Nets - predicts a \"compromise\" deal. It would give the six-time All-Star a nearly $9 million raise.\n\n\"A three-year, $90 million contract is a compromise from the player and his next team, likely Chicago,\" Marks wrote on June 17. \"DeRozan gets an extra $9 million more than his most recent contract, and the $27.7 million salary in the first year is less than 20% of the salary cap. The team gets protection in the third season in that $15 million out of the $32 million is guaranteed.\n\n\"The contract would become fully guaranteed if DeRozan plays a minimum of 65 games and Chicago reaches the first round of the playoffs in 2024-25 or 2025-26.\"\n\nDeRozan, 34, could consider the games played guarantees as \"likely.\"\n\nHe has shown remarkable durability, appearing in no fewer than 61 games in any season of his 14-year career. That includes logging at least 74 appearances in each of his three seasons with the Bulls.\n\nDeRozan has said that he wants to return, though he expressed frustration with constantly missing out on the playoffs.\n\nDeRozan made six straight postseason appearances from 2013-14 through 2018-19.\n\nHe has been to the playoffs just once since then. That was in 2021-22 when the Bulls got off to a hot start but faltered going into the All-Star break. They have been a Play-In Tournament team in each of the last two seasons.\n\nContinuing his union with the Bulls could be both a matter of desire and finances, as Marks explained the landscape favors his return.\n\n\"Unfortunately, outside of re-signing in Chicago with Bird rights, there are only five teams with room, including two, Detroit and Utah, who are rebuilding,\" Marks wrote. \"Oklahoma City and Orlando could also benefit from his scoring and leadership, but is either team willing to commit three seasons and an average of $30 million per season? The likely answer is no.\"\n\nBut letting DeRozan walk in free agency could fall under a similar category as Nikola Vucevic last offseason. Then, General Manager Marc Eversley admitted they explored their options including letting Vucevic leave in free agency. They concluded he was their best choice.\n\nVucevic received a three-year, $60 million contract before free agency in 2023. The pact received backlash for being over market value.\n\nThe Bulls can begin negotiating with DeRozan's camp again as soon as the NBA Finals conclude.\n\n\"The sticking point between the two sides has long been the parameters of a deal, both the amount of money and the length of the contract,\" The Athletic's Darnell Mayberry wrote on June 4. \"The Bulls would be happy to re-sign DeRozan on a two-year deal. DeRozan's side obviously would covet more security. The Bulls have a habit of liberally latching player options into contracts so that carrot could come into play with DeRozan's deal as well.\n\n\"The dollar amount will be hefty, likely north of $40 million annually, but is less significant to the Bulls' long-term flexibility. Chicago wants to keep DeRozan but at a reasonable commitment.\"\n\nDeRozan also rejected a previous offer from the Bulls, potentially worth up to $40 million annually, per NBC Sports Chicago's K.C. Johnson in April.\n\nMarks notes that DeRozan would be a \"perfect fit\" for either of the teams in Los Angeles, the Clippers and Lakers in free agency. DeRozan has said that he could \"never\" rule out playing for his hometown team. He has also said he didn't feel it was a necessary milestone.\n\nMarks also noted that they would need to orchestrate sign-and-trades to make a deal work. The Bulls would have to take back salary in that scenario.\n\nAll of that only further clouds DeRozan's market in free agency beyond the Bulls.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_buckhalter@heavy.com", "name": "Josh Buckhalter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Vu\u010devi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Eversley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Eversley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1827651698-3-e1718679541492.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 347}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 375, "textEnd": 382}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 667, "textEnd": 674}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2983, "textEnd": 2989}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He also paid homage to Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant, two prominent LA figures who died in recent years.\n\nLos Angeles-based athletes Russell Westbrook and Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan also joined Lamar on stage while the Compton rapper played \"Not Like Us,\" the marquee anti-Drake diss track of his discography; that song he played not once, but five times during the concert.\n\nThe song mentions DeRozan, saying \"I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither\" referring to DeRozan's return to the United States after nine years playing in Toronto, Drake's hometown.\n\nThe lyric was in response to Drake's admiration of the once Raptors forward in \"Lemon Pepper Freestyle\" when he rapped \"They love me in my city like DeMar DeRozan,\" an ode to him after being traded to the Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who ultimately brought Toronto the championship DeRozan couldn't.\n\nDeRozan's appearance at Lamar's concert is quite the message to Drake and Toronto. The Raptors drafted him out of USC with the No. 9 pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. He played the first nine seasons of his career in Toronto, earning four All-Star nods and two All-NBA selections there.\n\nHowever, it's widely known DeRozan is a major advocate for his hometown, training there every summer and having played in Compton Drew League games in recent summers. He also expressed strong interest in playing for his hometown Lakers before they abruptly traded for Westbrook during the summer of 2021.\n\nThat summer, instead of signing with the Lakers, DeRozan inked a three-year deal with the Bulls, rejuvenating his career in Chicago. With the Bulls over the last three years, he's earned two All-Star nods, two finalist appearances for the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year Award, and top-10 MVP voting in 2021.\n\nThe tides could turn this offseason, however, as DeRozan could potentially become an unrestricted free agent in July. According to NBC Sports Chicago's K.C. Johnson, the Bulls have offered DeRozan a two-year deal with a high annual salary of $40 million.\n\nWhether or not DeRozan remains in Chicago will soon be answered in the next couple of weeks as the NBA Draft and free agency are nearing. But it's clear his heart will always remain in Compton after showing out with Lamar and company on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Chicago was just one win away and a victory in Miami in the play-in tournament would've sent them to the playoffs, but they couldn't get the job done.\n\nSo, another season is in the books for the Bulls. After starting 5-14, things went pretty well, but they are still far from satisfying this hungry fan base. No one really expected this team to make it to the postseason in the early stages of the year, so making it this far was exceeding expectations, but the fan base wants more. The Bulls front office has said that they are going to make some changes this offseason, but fans will believe it when they see it.\n\nThe first thing that the Bulls need to do is have a good NBA Draft. The draft is coming up quickly as it is on June 26th. Chicago currently has the 11th pick in the draft, but there has been a lot of chatter about them making some trades. They could potentially trade up for a higher pick, or they could try to add some more picks in a trade. Either way, don't be shocked if the Bulls shake things up.\n\nChicago needs to get the offseason started with a bang in the NBA Draft. They need to get the right player(s) on their squad, and a bad pick could turn the fan base against them ever more. Here are two players that the Bulls need to avoid in the draft (not just for pick 11, but if they trade and have other picks as well).\n\nZach Edey, Purdue\n\nZach Edey has been the best player in college basketball for the past two seasons, but there is a reason why there will be a ton of players drafted ahead of him. Edey's game just doesn't translate over to the NBA. He isn't very athletic and he can't shoot, but he is big. He could be an outlier, but it isn't worth it for the Bulls to take a big risk like this.\n\nBronny James, USC\n\nIt also isn't worth the risk for the Bulls to draft Bronny James either. For other teams, it is worth the risk, but the fan base probably wouldn't be too happy if Chicago took a player that averaged less than five PPG last year. James could certainly end up being a good player in the NBA, but he isn't a player that the Bulls will be taking.\n\nIf the Bulls don't make any trades and end up with just pick 11, then avoiding these two players is a no-brainer. However, if they end up with a later pick, these are two guys that should not be picked.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Edey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Edey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/X-players-Bulls-must-avoid-in-2024-NBA-Draft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1394, "textEnd": 1403}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Now he's dancing onstage to Kendrick Lamar's diss track", "body": "NBA star DeMar DeRozan was seen cutting a rug onstage as Kendrick Lamar performed his hit \"Not Like Us\" on Wednesday night at the Kia Forum.\n\nThat might not seem so unusual. After all, seemingly half of Los Angeles was packed onto the Forum stage to dance along with the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper's earworm of a song, which also doubles as a Drake diss track and possibly the last word in Lamar's very public feud with the Canadian hip-hop superstar.\n\nDeRozan appears to be in a unique situation, however, in that he might have been the only person up there who has -- or at least had -- a friendship with Drake.\n\nA standout player at Compton High, DeRozan played at USC for a year before being selected at No. 9 overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2009 NBA draft. After spending the first nine years of his career with Toronto, earning three All-Star nods during that period, DeRozan was shipped to the San Antonio Spurs in the trade that brought Kawhi Leonard to the Raptors during the 2018 offseason. He was then traded to the Chicago Bulls in 2021 and is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer.\n\nDrake, whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, was born in Toronto and is a diehard Raptors fan. He has served as the team's global ambassador since 2013. The day DeRozan was traded to the Spurs, the \"God's Plan\" singer was there to provide comfort to the heartbroken player.\n\n\"I went to Drake's house. Me and him sat and talked for a couple of hours,\" DeRozan told ESPN in 2018. \"Not even on some hoops stuff. Just to hear the words that come from him being the person that he is in this world, especially in Toronto. What I meant to this city. It was what I needed.\"\n\nAt that time, Drake posted a heartfelt message to DeRozan on Instagram, referring to him as a \"brother\" as well as \"an incredible captain and an even better friend.\"\n\n\"To my brother @demar_derozan I want to say 10 million thank you's on behalf of YOUR city. You are a fixture in Toronto forever and you gave everything you had,\" Drake wrote in a post that appears to have been deleted. \"Through your leadership we had the most exciting years in franchise history. I am grateful to have witnessed your combination of skill, persistence, and loyalty from the same seats every night. Thank you for being an incredible captain and an even better friend.\"\n\nDrake also name-dropped the basketball star in his 2021 song \"Lemon Pepper Freestyle\" with the line, \"My city love me like DeMar DeRozan.\"\n\nBut Lamar has a connection with DeRozan as well.\n\nThey both grew up in Compton and were seen together at a 2020 peace march in the city. With his spat with Drake reaching epic proportions this spring, Lamar released \"Not Like Us,\" which also contains a line that references DeRozan: \"I'm glad DeRoz came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither.\"\n\nLamar performed the popular track multiple times in a row Wednesday during his \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" show in Inglewood on Juneteenth. DeRozan and Clippers star Russell Westbrook, who is from Long Beach and played for UCLA, appeared to be having a great time dancing with the masses onstage during Lamar's fifth and final time through the song. Lakers star LeBron James and soon-to-be NBA free agent James Harden, who played last season with the Clippers, were also in attendance but didn't take the stage.\n\nMaybe the move by DeRozan was nothing personal toward Drake. Maybe he just wanted to take part in a special moment without putting a lot of thought into it.\n\nOr maybe DeRozan was finally getting revenge for being dissed multiple times by the \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" singer during their 2017 NBA Awards skit with comedian Will Ferrell. Drake is probably having second thoughts about making fun of DeRozan's name -- with lines such as, \"DeMar I say it, de less I like it\" and \"DeFense? Is that your cousin, DeMar?\" -- right about now.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Clippers star Russell Westbrook and Chicago Bulls star DeMar DeRozan have chosen to explore their interest in music during this offseason.\n\nOn Juneteenth, the famous American rapper Kendrick Lamar held his highly anticipated 'Pop Out' concert in Los Angeles. Lamar, known for his captivating performances, was delivering his hit \"Not Like Us!\". At that time, Westbrook and DeRozan made a surprise appearance on stage.\n\nThe concert, one of the year's most anticipated events, attracted a large crowd. Westbrook and DeRozan took the opportunity to enjoy the moment and share the stage with Lamar.\n\nIn addition to Westbrook and DeRozan, other NBA players were also spotted enjoying the concert. NBA legends LeBron James, Kendrick Perkins, Coby White, and Dalen Terry were among those in attendance.\n\nRussell Westbrook might explore free agency this offseason, as a report suggested his intention to depart from the Clippers. He has a player option for the upcoming season valued at $4 million, following a modest two-year $7.87 million contract signed at the beginning of last season.\n\nReports indicate that the Miami Heat are leading the race to sign former MVP Russell Westbrook in free agency. Last season, Westbrook posted averages of 11.1 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.5 assists while shooting 45.4% from the field.\n\nSimilarly, DeMar DeRozan is poised to enter free agency with the chance to join any team. DeRozan has not ruled out a potential return to Los Angeles with the Lakers or the Clippers. As the Chicago Bulls are anticipated to undergo a rebuild, there's a possibility of seeing DeRozan in an LA uniform by the end of the next season.

He averaged 19.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists for the Ignite last season.\n\nShannon was accused of sexually assaulting a woman while visiting Lawrence, Kan., for a Sept. 8 football game. He was charged on Dec. 5 and was found not guilty of charges of rape and aggravated sexual battery last week after deliberations by a Douglas County, Kan., jury.\n\nThe allegation and resulting legal case cost Shannon six games in his final season at Illinois and could negatively impact the projected first-round pick's draft stock.\n\nThe Bulls own the 11th selection in next Wednesday's first round of the draft and need more size and versatility on the wing, as well as depth in the frontcourt.\n\nShannon, a 6-foot-6 wing, averaged 23 points while shooting 36.2 percent on a career-high 6.7 3-pointers per game last season at Illinois. On March 16, Shannon set a Big Ten Tournament record with 40 points in a win against Nebraska. Shannon's scoring could be useful for the Bulls, particularly if the team parts ways with Zach LaVine via trade this summer.\n\nThe Bulls have a long history of acquiring locals. The team signed local product Jevon Carter last summer in free agency and drafted Chicago native Ayo Dosunmu from Illinois in the second round in 2021. In 2018, the Bulls signed Chicago native Jabari Parker. And in 2016, the franchise added Dwyane Wade. Of course, the Bulls also drafted Derrick Rose with the No. 1 pick in 2008.\n\nMonday's pre-draft workout by the Bulls also included prospects Ryan Dunn, a 6-foot-8 wing out of Virginia, Villanova's Justin Moore, a 6-foot-5 wing, Duke's Kyle Filipowski, a 7-foot center and UCLA's Adem Bona, a 6-foot-10 post player.\n\nFilipowski, a projected top-20 pick, could bolster the Bulls' frontcourt depth behind Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107. Reserve center Andre Drummond is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer, and the Bulls might be in the market for a quality option who can be groomed into Vu\u010devi\u0107's replacement.\n\nBona is a projected second-round pick, while Moore's range is the late second-round selection to undrafted.\n\nHowever, Dunn could be the biggest sleeper of Monday's group session, if not this year's draft.\n\nThe forward was among college basketball's best perimeter defenders. Dunn played for the same coach, Tony Bennett, and in the same lockdown defensive system that produced Atlanta Hawks forward De'Andre Hunter and Portland Trail Blazers guard Malcolm Brogdon.\n\n\"He's the best wing defender I've evaluated in a long time,\" The Athletic's Sam Vecenie wrote in March.\n\nDunn, an ACC All-Defensive Team selection following his breakout sophomore season, averaged 2.3 blocks and 1.3 steals in 27.5 minutes per game. With his length and defensive versatility, it's easy to see Dunn fitting snugly on a roster led by Vu\u010devi\u0107, LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Coby White.\n\n\"He's elite as a help defender with timely rotations and scramble instincts,\" Vecenie wrote. \"He's disruptive with his hands and forces turnovers at an elite level. He's strong and physical. He's switchable athletically, capable of guarding one through five in college, and one through four in the NBA.\"\n\nDunn's prototype is in the mold of some of the league's best defenders, such as Minnesota Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels, New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones and New York Knicks forward OG Anunoby.\n\nThe knock on Dunn is his offensive game, particularly his shooting. He made only 12 of 51 3-pointers in his two seasons at Virginia and must prove he can be a consistent outside shooter to morph into a two-way threat.\n\n\"He's a sharp cutter and offensive rebounder, but that's it,\" Vecenie wrote. \"If a team thinks they can figure out their spacing around him, I would go for it.\"\n\nIf Dunn had a proven perimeter stroke, he'd be a no-brainer top-10 pick. But the Bulls, sitting just outside the top 10, are in a prime position to pluck the top defender.\n\nChicago has built adequate infrastructure to transform a prospect like Dunn into a more well-rounded player. The Bulls hired respected shooting coach Peter Patton as their director of player development last summer. He's already been credited with the improved shooting of Bulls players such as Dosunmu, Dalen Terry and Julian Phillips.\n\nThe Bulls, as they did with Patrick Williams in 2020, could take a slightly early swing on a player with obvious strengths. Or, if the Bulls get creative, a path exists to trade back and snag a player like Dunn slightly later in the first round while collecting additional assets from the team looking to move up.\n\nMuch of next week's decision for the Bulls will depend on how the board shakes out in front of them. Dunn is an intriguing option who fits a need and will almost certainly be on the board at 11. At 21 years old, Dunn is ready to step in and supply quality defense from opening night.\n\nBut he naturally won't be viewed as having the same upside as Holland, who is three weeks shy of his 19th birthday. But how long are the win-now Bulls willing to wait for another teenager to develop?\n\nChicago's current roster and recent history of player acquisitions suggest the Bulls will be in the market for versatility. In addition to drafting Williams in 2020, Terry in 2022 and Phillips in 2023, the Bulls also have signed multifaceted forwards in free agency such as Derrick Jones Jr. and Torrey Craig.\n\nThere's a good chance the Bulls met their next rangy wing in Monday's workout.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In addition to the stars that took the stage to perform, LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan were among the NBA stars in attendance.\n\nWestbrook and DeRozan weren't just on hand at the Kia Forum, the two also took the stage with Lamar as he closed the show with five consecutive performances of \"Not Like Us,\" the hit record created as part of a rap feud with Drake.\n\nWhy were these NBA stars in attendance and why did Westbrook and DeRozan take the stage? Here is more on their role in the production.\n\nMORE: How Kendrick Lamar's 'Not Like Us' took over sporting events\n\nWhy Russell Westbrook, other NBA stars attended Kendrick Lamar's 'Pop Out'\n\nEach of the biggest NBA stars in attendance has major ties to Los Angeles. While DeRozan, Harden and Westbrook are all natives of Los Angeles County, James just concluded his sixth season with the Lakers.\n\nAs expected, \"The Pop Out\" was a momentous occasion for Los Angeles. As Lamar said on stage, it was much deeper than the concert itself.\n\n\"This s -- making me emotional, man,\" Lamar said as he was joined on stage by some of LA's most notable names. \"We've been f -- ed up since Nipsey (Hussle) died, hold up. We've been f -- ed up since Kobe died.\"\n\nIn a span of 10 months, LA lost two idols in Crenshaw's Nipsey Hussle and Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, losses that they haven't fully recovered from. And while the Lakers and Dodgers would win championships months after Bryant's death, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented a proper celebration.\n\nFour years later, Lamar provided LA with a platform to celebrate itself, its legends and the city's impact on the globe.\n\nMORE: How Kendrick Lamar paid homage to Kobe Bryant with 2022 music video\n\nWhere is Russell Westbrook from?\n\nWestbrook was born in Long Beach, Calif. and raised in Hawthorne, Calif, two cities in Los Angeles County.\n\nWhen Westbrook represented the United States at the 2012 Olympics, he listed Long Beach as his hometown. Westbrook also considers South Los Angeles home and makes a point to give back to the South LA Community, including a recent court dedication at Jesse Owens Park.\n\nA late bloomer at Lawndale, Calif.'s Leuzinger HS, Westbrook stayed home and played collegiately at UCLA. After 13 seasons in the NBA, Westbrook returned home to play for the Lakers in 2021 and has been a member of the Clippers since 2023.\n\nWhere is DeMar DeRozan from?\n\nDeRozan was born and raised in Compton, Calif., a part of the South Los Angeles region of Los Angeles County. Kendrick Lamar also hails from Compton.\n\nDeRozan rose to prominence at Compton HS, where he led the Tarbabes to a 26-6 record as a senior. A consensus five-star recruit in the class of 2008, DeRozan was a McDonald's All-American and decided to stay home and attend USC.\n\nLike Westbrook, DeRozan has continuously contributed to the enrichment of his community. In 2016, the gymnasium at Compton's Lueders Park was renamed in DeRozan's honor.\n\nDeMar DeRozan-Drake relationship\n\nDeRozan was selected ninth overall by the Raptors in the 2009 NBA Draft. Following the 2010 departure of Chris Bosh, DeRozan quickly rose to prominence as a fan favorite in Toronto at the same time that Drake, a Toronto native, was rising to prominence as a global star in the music realm.\n\nDrake's lifetime fanhood of his hometown team helped foster a relationship with DeRozan. In 2013, Drake became the franchise's global ambassador, adding a formal element to his relationship with the franchise.\n\nDuring DeRozan's Raptors tenure, he and Drake did a skit with Will Ferrell and shared the cover of SLAM Magazine with Kyle Lowry among many other moments. After DeRozan was traded to the Spurs in 2018, Drake penned an Instagram farewell in which he called DeRozan his brother.\n\nOn Drake's 2021 \"Lemon Pepper Freestyle,\" he paid homage by saying, \"And my city love me like DeMar DeRozan,\" a reminder of Toronto's enduring adulation for the Compton native.\n\nThree years later, Kendrick Lamar left no stone unturned with his tracks toward Drake, saying, \"I'm glad DeRoz' (DeRozan) came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither,\" adding a layer to the feud by insinuating that DeRozan was better off stateside than with Canada's team.", "source":

Recently, Athletic reporter Jovan Buha addressed the possibility of DeRozan joining the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nA Lakers fan asked Buha about the potential of DeRozan teaming up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Nevertheless, Buha quickly shut down this idea.\n\n\"There's always a chance, but I do not see it happening unless DeMar makes it a priority to get back home, get to LA, and play for his favorite team growing up,\" Jovan Buha said.\n\nBuha later highlighted that DeRozan's struggles with perimeter offense and defense make him a poor fit for the Lakers.\n\n\"In terms of what the Lakers need, if they are adding a third star type, ideally, that player is a plus shooter who can play off the ball more and/or [who is] a better defender. DeRozan doesn't really check either box,\" Buha added.\n\nDeRozan, who was raised in Southern California, has been associated with the Los Angeles Lakers for years.\n\nDeMar DeRozan concluded a strong season with the Chicago Bulls. During the 2023-24 campaign, the six-time All-Star averaged 24.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.1 steals per game.\n\nThe six-time All-Star excels in one-on-one situations, particularly in the midrange area. His skill set allows him to create and convert shots effectively. The Bulls star even set the record for the most minutes played by an NBA player.\n\nHowever, despite his strengths in scoring inside the arc, DeRozan faces limitations as a long-range shooter. Throughout the season, he struggled from beyond the three-point line, shooting at a rate of 33.3%.\n\nAlso Read: WATCH: Social Media Is Stunned Over Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan Hitting the Stage at Kendrick Lamar's Concert.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shabiha_akter@totalprosports.com", "name": "Shabiha Akter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2077008920-scaled-e1718886134394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

George has been to three All-Star games, and the Clippers have gotten as far as the Western Conference Finals, but they still don't have a championship trophy in their showcase.\n\nNow, the future of the star duo is in question because George is expected to test free agency by opting out of his $48.7 salary for the upcoming season while pursuing a longer contract that pays much more.\n\nSo far, the Clippers have had issues agreeing on George's contract value. If that continues, and the nine-time All-Star signs with a new team, the Clippers will naturally want to replenish their star power.\n\nThe 2024 NBA free agency class isn't exactly brimming with big names who could be a 1-for-1 replacement for George, but there is one local player that the fans would quickly be drawn to.\n\nRelated: 10 moves to help Dallas Mavericks win next year's NBA Finals\n\nRecently, when discussing the possibility of George leaving LA, NBA insider Marc Stein asked Yahoo's Chris Haynes whether DeMar DeRozan would become an option for the Clippers in free agency. While Haynes hasn't heard DeRozan's name come up in conversations so far, he agreed the six-time All-Star could be a strong fit in Los Angeles.\n\n\"DeMar DeRozan would be a logical secondary option for sure. So what I'm not saying that I've heard that from my own entail, but that was seem like a logical move DeMar DeRozan from LA as well. He actually wanted to go to the Lakers before he went to the Bulls. Talks as far as financially didn't get to the point to where DeRozan could seriously consider that offer. So he ended up in Chicago but I can see that I can definitely see that.\"\n\nDeRozan, like George, is a free agent this summer. He's not likely to have nearly as many suitors as George, but he also won't command as much money on the open market either. Plus, the idea of the Compton native reuniting with Leonard, only this time in Los Angeles instead of San Antonio, could be appealing too.\n\nFor the Clippers, maybe there's more appeal to paying a lesser amount for DeRozan instead of possibly overpaying for George. There's also the durability factor, where DeRozan has never played fewer than 60 games in a season during his 15-year career, playing a total of 1110 games.\n\nGeorge has only played more than 54 games once in the past five seasons, yet it did come last year. Yet, he's only played 867 games in his 14-year career and actually has a lower career scoring average at 20.8 PPG compared to DeRozan's 21.2.\n\nWhere DeRozan pales in comparison is on defense, where George is a four-time member of the All-Defensive team, which is why he's a six-time All-NBA player, and DeRozan has only accomplished the feat three times. In other words, George is worth every penny, but DeRozan still offers consistent production, on one end of the court.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_buller_russ@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Andrew Buller-Russ", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NBA-Los-Angeles-Clippers-at-New-Orleans-Pelicans-22231482.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The NBA season came to a close on Monday night when the Boston Celtics took down the Dallas Mavericks to win it all, and the draft is the first big event of the offseason. The Chicago Bulls had another disappointing season as they failed to reach the playoffs, so the offseason started a long time ago for them. The NBA Draft will be huge for the Bulls as it is the start of what will be a crucial offseason for the organization. They need to do a good job.\n\nThe Bulls finished the regular season with a 39-43 record. They did get a win against the Atlanta Hawks in their first play-in tournament game, but they once again failed to make it into the playoffs. Chicago was just one win away and a victory agains the Miami Heat on the road in the play-in tournament would've sent them to the playoffs, but they couldn't get the job done.\n\nSo, another season is in the books for the Bulls. After starting 5-14, things went pretty well, but they are still far from satisfying this hungry fan base. No one really expected this team to make it to the postseason in the early stages of the year, so making it this far was exceeding expectations, but the fan base wants more. The Bulls front office has said that they are going to make some changes this offseason, but fans will believe it when they see it.\n\nThe first thing that the Bulls need to do is have a good NBA Draft. The draft is coming up quickly as it is on June 26th. Chicago currently has the 11th pick in the draft, but they could try to make some trades to move up or add some picks. Right now, it's just pick number 11 for them, and here are their two best options for that spot.\n\nDalton Knecht, Tennessee\n\nDalton Knecht was a star for the Northern Colorado basketball team before transferring to Tennessee, and a lot of people wondered how his game would translate over to the SEC. Well, he got even better. Knecht had his best college season as he averaged over 21 PPG last year, and he was the heart and soul of the Volunteers squad. If the Bulls can take him, they should.\n\nSome players just have that it factor that allows them to go and get a bucket when their team needs to score. The Bulls could use a young star like that, and Dalton Knecht could be that guy. Chicago does have Coby White who is emerging as a similar type of threat, but Knecht could end up being on a different level as a scorer. Obviously, things will be harder in the NBA, but he scored over 30 points eight times last year. That doesn't happen often in college basketball.\n\nDalton Knecht has the potential to be a superstar, and the Bulls could have a chance to land him.\n\nDonovan Clingan, UConn\n\nDonovan Clingan is now a two-time national champion as the UConn basketball team has won two straight national titles. Clingan is a winner, and he is also a very intriguing prospect because of his size and athleticism. He is 7'2'', but he doesn't move like it. He has the ability to quickly move up and down the floor.\n\nIf the Bulls do want to take a big man, Donovan Clingan is a great option. It's not often that you find someone with his size that moves the way he does. It would be pretty surprising if he is still there at 11, but if he is, Chicago should take him.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Northern_Colorado", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Northern Colorado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Clingan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Clingan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coby_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coby White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bulls-best-options-for-No.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666144", "eventUri": "eng-9666144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1472, "textEnd": 1481}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

In Musselman, the Trojans have a head coach with .704 career winning percentage at the college level who has made two Elite Eight's and a Sweet Sixteen appearance in the last four years. But in his first year at USC, Musselman will have his work cut out for him.\n\nThere will be plenty of new faces on the USC Trojans roster this season, with 11 transfers coming in, including Desmond Claude (16.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists at Xavier), Saint Thomas (19.7 points, 9.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists at Northern Colorado), Chibuzo Agbo (13.7 points, 5.1 rebounds at Boise State), Terrance Williams II (12.4 points, 4.5 rebounds at Michigan) and Josh Cohen (15.9 points, 6.8 rebounds at UMass). But Eric Musselman is also opening the doors for familiar faces. Guys who once called the Galen Center home are always welcome back at USC.\n\nBefore making an appearance at Kendrick Lamar's LA concert on Wednesday night, DeMar DeRozan got some shots up in his old stomping grounds. Though the Compton, California only played one season at USC, it was an impactful one. DeRozan started all 35 games during his freshman season, averaging 13.9 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. He was named a Pac-10 All-Freshman performer and in leading the Trojans to their first ever Pac-10 Title, he was named the Pac-10 Tournament MVP. DeRozan is one of only seven players who have had their jersey retired by the university.\n\nGiven DeMar DeRozan's short (but impactful) collegiate career at USC and the love he has for his hometown, an NBA return to Los Angeles seems to always be on the table when it comes to DeMar DeRozan. And DeRozan himself hasn't been shy about his potential desire to play for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"I mean, when I was a kid, everybody knows I'm a Kobe guy at the end of the day. Always been a Kobe guy, been a Laker fan since day one,\" DeRozan said back in May on FanDuel TV's Run It Back (h/t Matt Peralta of Lakers Nation). \"You can't never say no about playing at home, especially playing for a historic team like the Lakers. So time will tell, we'll see where the cards fall. Until then, I'll see what happens. Always want to be where I'm wanted and I know what I'm gonna do from there, so we'll see how it plays out.\"\n\nThe main issue here is money, and the limited amount of it that the Lakers could potentially pay DeRozan this summer if he were to opt out of his contract with the Chicago Bulls and become an unrestricted free agent. As things stand right now, the Lakers would be able to offer DeRozan the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which equates to roughly $13 million annually. This would not only be significantly lower than what the Bulls have been paying DeRozan, but also much lower than his price around the league would be on the open market.\n\nBut maybe a chance to play in Los Angeles to close out his career is exactly the opportunity that DeMar DeRozan is looking for.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

Former league MVPs LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden were among the attendees.\n\nThe NBA stars had themselves a great time, with Westbrook and DeRozan even going on stage and dancing alongside Lamar during the performance of 'Not Like Us,' the Billboard-topping Drake diss released by Lamar last month.\n\nThe concert has been considered one of the most anticipated of the year, as this is Lamar's first public appearance after his summer diss war with Drake, which has reinforced his status as arguably the biggest star in hip-hop right now. The concert was bound to have NBA stars in attendance given how popular Kendrick's diss tracks have been among NBA players, with them getting regular play over the NBA Playoffs.\n\nLeBron James is known as one of Drake's close friends but has been seen publicly enjoying many of the disses that have come out against the Canadian rapper. Given that he is the premier star on Los Angeles' biggest NBA team, he was bound to come to such a culturally significant concert in the area. Other stars like Harden, Westbrook, and DeRozan are LA natives.\n\nIt seems many active Bulls players attended the concert alongside DeRozan, with 2024 Most Improved Player finalist Coby White and sophomore Dalen Terry also being spotted in attendance.\n\nThe Stars In Attendance Are Free Agents This Summer\n\nThis is a big summer for almost all the players that were enjoying their offseason at the Kendrick Lamar concert. Stars like LeBron, Harden, Westbrook, and DeRozan have to make major decisions on their future this summer.\n\nLeBron would be the biggest free agent to hit the market, provided he turns down his $51 million player option. Reports suggest he's leaning in that direction and then negotiating an extension with the Lakers, but there's no official statement on what he's doing with the player option yet.\n\nRussell Westbrook also has a $4 million player option on his contract. His status is also unclear, but Westbrook has proven he is more valuable than a minimum contract and could enter free agency to see what the open market provides before broaching an extension with the Clippers.\n\nHis teammate James Harden is entering free agency no matter what and is hoping to secure a final payday after failing to secure an extension with the Philadelphia 76ers last summer, which led to his trade to the Clippers.\n\nDeRozan has had a strong three seasons for the Bulls, emerging as the clear best player on the franchise. Unfortunately, the Bulls have made one first-round appearance in these three seasons and need to pick a direction for the future. The 34-year-old DeRozan might not be a key part of the franchise going forward, which could lead to him leaving this summer.\n\nBefore the contract negotiation windows open up, it's great to see these players enjoy their summer before they have to make major decisions on their NBA futures.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Free Agency: 5 Best Destinations For DeMar DeRozan Including Lakers And Warriors\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Do you know where the Chicago Bulls are?\n\nAll over the place seems to be the prevailing sentiment from several rival executives---and that should be a good thing for some weary Bulls fans.\n\nThis isn't to suggest a lack of focus from a management group that, for the first time in April, admitted \"this group hasn't worked.\" It's more an example of how broadly Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas and his staff are approaching an offseason where changes must be made to a franchise that has failed to make the playoffs in two straight seasons.\n\n\"Everything is on the table,\" Karni\u0161ovas said in April.\n\nIt's why there has been talk of the Bulls both trying to move up and back in next week's draft, where they currently own the 11 pick. And, yes, staying put and letting the top remaining player on their board from a wildly disparate draft be their pick is also an option.\n\nIt's why Zach LaVine's future isn't the only trade scenario that has been discussed, even if sources said Karni\u0161ovas has floated as many as 15 proposals centered on the two-time All-Star guard to various teams including the Sacramento Kings, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nIt doesn't take a capologist to figure out the Bulls can't add a first-round pick and re-sign DeMar DeRozan and Patrick Williams -- both of which Karni\u0161ovas has said he wants to do---without entering the luxury tax unless an extremely advantageous salary cap trade of LaVine occurs.\n\nIt's why the futures of those two players plus Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball will be in the headlines this offseason.\n\nThe Bulls have until June 30 at 5 p.m. Central to sign DeRozan to a new contract or else he enters unrestricted free agency. While both sides have publicly stated the desire for the relationship to continue, the Bulls have largely focused on shorter-term deals.\n\nAs for Williams, even with widespread speculation that the Oklahoma City Thunder, Detroit Pistons and Charlotte Hornets may show interest, the Bulls feel they're in the driver's seat. They have the choice to match any offer sheet Williams may sign. Also, while the roughly $6 million gap in annual salary from last season's rookie contract negotiations may seem large, perhaps it can be easily bridged in light of the imminent rising salary cap from the new TV rights deals.\n\nAs for Caruso, he becomes extension eligible on July 6 off one of the league's best bargain contracts. His roughly $9.9 million deal for 2024-25 becomes fully guaranteed on June 30.\n\nIf the Bulls know he'll seek more next offseason than the four year, $78.8 million extension they can---but aren't obligated to---offer him this offseason, would management consider cashing in that asset now? They've turned down significant trade interest in him at the past two deadlines.\n\nBall's arduous comeback attempt continues to advance, although until he consistently plays in 5-on-5 contact scrimmages, it's hard to gauge how it concludes.\n\nEspecially with the Bulls owing the San Antonio Spurs a top-10 protected pick in 2025, hitting on this year's first-round pick is important. The Bulls still have developmental work on two former first-round picks in Williams and Dalen Terry, not to mention last season's second-round addition of Julian Phillips.\n\nThis year's draft is hard to predict given the variance in talent evaluation for prospects long on potential but shorter on immediate starpower. Providence guard Devin Carter, Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham, G League Ignite's Ron Holland and Duke big man Kyle Filipowski are some of the many names to watch for the Bulls, who have worked out a wide range of prospects.\n\nThis is an extremely important offseason for the Bulls, who, at least in DeRozan's case, are on the clock even before next week's draft puts them on it again.", "source":

Picture: PA. (Image: PA.)\n\nThat form carried over into the 2002 World Cup Challenge, as he scored twice in a rollicking 41-26 victory over NRL champions Newcastle Knights to ensure Bulls won the trophy for the first time.\n\nWithers played throughout Bulls' most golden era, winning the Super League Grand Final with them three times.\n\nHe also featured in all three of their World Club Challenge successes between 2002 and 2006, while he lifted the Challenge Cup in 2000, scoring twice in the win over Leeds at Murrayfield, and 2003.\n\nWith a trophy cabinet fit to burst, and 108 tries in 177 games for Bulls, Withers has a case to be the club's greatest modern-era Aussie of all.\n\nDANIEL GARTNER\n\nThe Australian forward was part of the great Manly Sea Eagles side of the 1990s, whose defeat to Canterbury in the 1995 Premiership final was a shock akin to Sheffield's Challenge Cup final win over Wigan three years later.\n\nAfter dominating all before them that year before flopping when it mattered, Gartner and Manly bounced back to lift the 1996 Premiership title.\n\nAfter 120 appearances for the Sea Eagles, and a cap for Australia, Gartner headed over to England to play for Bulls in 2000.\n\nPlaying at second row in that destruction of the Warriors at Old Trafford in 2001, he also scored in that thrilling World Club Challenge success against Newcastle.\n\nIn his final season in professional rugby league before heading back home to study to be a physiotherapist at Sydney University, Gartner played a key role in Bulls' famous 2003 treble.\n\nDaniel Gartner (left) puts in a tackle during Bulls' Challenge Cup quarter-final win over Widnes in 2003, as the side made their way to a famous treble. (Image: PA.)\n\nAnd in a nice full circle moment for the Sea Eagles stalwart, when back in Australia, he enjoyed a stint as physio for Manly's youth sides.\n\nGRAEME BRADLEY\n\nBradley was 32 by the time he pitched up at Bulls in 1996, as the Super League era began in earnest.\n\nPart of the Penrith Panthers squad that won their first ever Premiership title in 1991 and in St George Dragons' team that were Aussie runners-up in 1993, either side of a brief spell in England at Castleford, many might have though the centre's best days were behind him when he arrived at Odsal.\n\nBut he enjoyed a special relationship with Bradford's head coach Brian Smith, who had been his schoolteacher in the 1970s, as well as his coach at Illawarra Steelers in the 1980s.\n\nPlaying for Bulls in the 1990s gave Bradley the chance to spend a third decade working with Smith, and he repaid the man who was almost a father figure to him.\n\nBradley was a vital cog in the Bulls machine that reached the Challenge Cup finals in 1996 and 1997, while he was a key factor in the club's first-ever Super League success in 1997, as Matthew Elliott's men won their first 20 league games to storm to the title in emphatic fashion.\n\nBradford Bulls' phenomenal class of 1997 celebrate winning Super League for the very first time. (Image: T&A.)\n\nThe veteran enjoyed one more season at Bulls, before deciding to retire at the end of the 1998 campaign aged 34.\n\nBEN JEFFRIES\n\nThe half-back left Wests Tigers at the end of 2002 to come to Wakefield, and played for both Trinity and Bulls over the next decade.\n\nBy the time he finally left Bradford, at the end of his second spell there in 2012, he was the only Australian to have spent 10 consecutive seasons in Super League.\n\nHe was deserving of that accolade, simply on account of being a mighty fine stand off.\n\nAs a youngster at Wakefield, Jeffries' try-scoring record was ridiculous for his position, as he helped himself to 44 tries in 60 games combined in 2004 and 2005, guiding them to a surprise elimination semi-final in the former year.\n\nMoving to Bulls at the end of 2007, Jeffries helped guide Bulls to the play-offs, taking on a huge role within the team as the hitherto fantastic half-back pairing of Iestyn Harris and Paul Deacon saw their influence start to wane.\n\nBen Jeffries (left) played a key role for Bulls in the 2008 season, and he is seen here trying to evade the clutches of Leeds' Nick Scruton at Headingley. (Image: Andy Garbutt.)\n\nHe left to join Wakefield in 2009, but returned to Bulls in 2011 and 2012, where he had a major influence on the career of his young half-back partner Luke Gale, who went on to win the League leaders' Shield and Man of Steel award with Castleford, before sealing the Challenge Cup for Leeds in 2020 with a last-gasp drop goal.\n\nFinishing with a flourish at Bulls, Jeffries racked up a phenomenal 19 try assists in 2012, with his prowess as a boot to ball player never in doubt.\n\nGLENN MORRISON\n\nBack rower Morrison was no spring chicken by the time he joined Bulls in 2007, having made over 200 appearances for historic Aussie quartet Balmain Tigers, where he played in the same side as Withers, North Sydney Bears, North Queensland Cowboys and Parramatta Eels.\n\nYet remarkably he was still playing rugby in Bradford a couple of years ago, turning out for union side Bradford Salem when not being their coach.\n\nMorrison is now intrinsically liked with Bradford, thanks to his time at Salem, and his current roles as a teacher at Bradford Grammar School and Bulls' academy head coach.\n\nIt all started for him in the city when he joined the Odsal outfit under then-head coach Steve McNamara.\n\nThe current Catalans boss clearly valued the 30-year-old, immediately making the Aussie his vice-captain.\n\nAnd Morrison was an instant hit, with his first season in England in 2007 seeing him named in the Super League Dream Team, while he swept the board at the club's end of season awards.\n\nGlenn Morrison leaves the Hull KR defence for dust to score a try in his excellent debut season for Bulls in 2007. (Image: Newsquest.)\n\nHis form carried on into 2008, where he made a monumental 733 tackles that season, the sixth-most in the whole of Super League.\n\nMorrison was a positive influence on a couple of young back rowers while at Bulls too, with Sam Burgess and Elliott Whitehead going on to become two of England's best players of the past 15 years.\n\nA special mention to the likes of Jeremy Donougher, Brad Meyers and Heath L'Estrange as well, as we hope the current Australian crop at Bulls go on to be as fondly remembered as some of these past stars from Down Under.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- A Catholic school in North Carolina had the right to fire a gay teacher who announced his marriage on social media a decade ago, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, reversing a judge's earlier decision.\n\nA panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, reversed a 2021 ruling that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte had violated Lonnie Billard's federal employment protections against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The school said Billard wasn't invited back as a substitute teacher because of his \"advocacy in favor of a position that is opposed to what the church teaches about marriage,\" a court document said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Max Cogburn determined Billard -- a full-time teacher for a decade until 2012 -- was a lay employee for the limited purpose of teaching secular classes. Cogburn said a trial would still have to be held to determine appropriate relief for him. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court declared Title VII also protected workers who were fired for being gay or transgender.\n\nBut Circuit Judge Pamela Harris, writing Wednesday's prevailing opinion, said that Billard fell under a \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII that courts have derived from the First Amendment that protects religious institutions in how they treat employees \"who perform tasks so central to their religious missions -- even if the tasks themselves do not advertise their religious nature.\"\n\nThat included Billard -- who primarily taught English as a substitute and who previously drama when working full-time -- because Charlotte Catholic expected instructors to integrate faith throughout the curriculum, Harris wrote. And the school's apparent expectation that Billard be ready to instruct religion as needed speaks to his role in the school's religious mission, she added.\n\n\"The record makes clear that (Charlotte Catholic) considered it \"vital\" to its religious mission that its teachers bring a Catholic perspective to bear on Shakespeare as well as on the Bible,\" wrote Harris, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama. \"Our court has recognized before that seemingly secular tasks like the teaching of English and drama may be so imbued with religious significance that they implicate the ministerial exception.\"\n\nBillard, who sued in 2017, began working at the school in 2001. He met his now-husband in 2000, and announced their decision to get married shortly after same-sex marriage was made legal in North Carolina in 2014.\n\nIn a news release, the American Civil Liberties Union and a Charlotte law firm that helped Billard file his lawsuit lamented Wednesday's reversal as \"a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves.\"\n\nThe decision threatens to encroach on the rights of LGBTQ+ workers \"by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons,\" the joint statement read.\n\nAn attorney for a group that defended the Charlotte diocese praised the decision as \"a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\" The diocese operates 20 schools across western North Carolina.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" said Luke Goodrich with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.

(AP) -- A Catholic school in North Carolina had the right to fire a gay teacher who announced his marriage on social media a decade ago, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, reversing a judge's earlier decision.\n\nA panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, reversed a 2021 ruling that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte had violated Lonnie Billard's federal employment protections against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The school said Billard wasn't invited back as a substitute teacher because of his \"advocacy in favor of a position that is opposed to what the church teaches about marriage,\" a court document said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Max Cogburn determined Billard -- a full-time teacher for a decade until 2012 -- was a lay employee for the limited purpose of teaching secular classes. Cogburn said a trial would still have to be held to determine appropriate relief for him. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court declared Title VII also protected workers who were fired for being gay or transgender.\n\nBut Circuit Judge Pamela Harris, writing Wednesday's prevailing opinion, said that Billard fell under a \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII that courts have derived from the First Amendment that protects religious institutions in how they treat employees \"who perform tasks so central to their religious missions -- even if the tasks themselves do not advertise their religious nature.\"\n\nThat included Billard -- who primarily taught English as a substitute and who previously drama when working full-time -- because Charlotte Catholic expected instructors to integrate faith throughout the curriculum, Harris wrote. And the school's apparent expectation that Billard be ready to instruct religion as needed speaks to his role in the school's religious mission, she added.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The record makes clear that (Charlotte Catholic) considered it \"vital\" to its religious mission that its teachers bring a Catholic perspective to bear on Shakespeare as well as on the Bible,\" wrote Harris, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama. \"Our court has recognized before that seemingly secular tasks like the teaching of English and drama may be so imbued with religious significance that they implicate the ministerial exception.\"\n\nBillard, who sued in 2017, began working at the school in 2001. He met his now-husband in 2000, and announced their decision to get married shortly after same-sex marriage was made legal in North Carolina in 2014.\n\nIn a news release, the American Civil Liberties Union and a Charlotte law firm that helped Billard file his lawsuit lamented Wednesday's reversal as \"a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves.\"\n\nThe decision threatens to encroach on the rights of LGBTQ+ workers \"by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons,\" the joint statement read.\n\nAn attorney for a group that defended the Charlotte diocese praised the decision as \"a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\" The diocese operates 20 schools across western North Carolina.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" said Luke Goodrich with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Attorneys general from nearly 20 liberal-leaning states as well as lawyers from Christian denominations and schools and other organizations filed briefs in the case.\n\nCircuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, joined Harris' opinion. Circuit Judge Robert King, a nominee of former President Bill Clinton, wrote a separate opinion, saying he agreed with the reversal while also questioning the use of the ministerial exemption. Rather, he wrote, that Charlotte Catholic fell under a separate exemption in Title VII for religious education institutions dismissing an employee.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He met his now-husband in 2000, and announced that they would be getting married after same-sex marriage became legal in North Carolina in 2014, the same year he was fired. He sued the school in 2017.\n\nAfter Wednesday's ruling, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a Charlotte law firm that helped Billard file his lawsuit, branded the decision \"heart-breaking\".\n\nBillard \"wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" the ACLU said.\n\nThe decision will affect other LGBTQ+ workers by \"widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr Billard for openly discriminatory reasons\", the organisation claimed.\n\nCommenting on the 2021 ruling that decreed he had been discriminated against, Billard said: \"I wish I could have remained teaching all this time... today's decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.\"\n\nHe reportedly has 14 days to ask the Fourth Circuit court to rehear his case, or 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian,

He was fired several weeks later. Billard then sued the school for sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and a district court judge ruled in his favor in 2021.\n\nWednesday's decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed that ruling, finding that the religious high school's termination of Billard \"falls under the ministerial exception to Title VII.\"\n\n\"We conclude that the school entrusted Billard with 'vital religious duties,' making him a 'messenger' of its faith and placing him within the ministerial exception,\" the ruling, written by Judge Pamela Harris, states.\n\nTitle VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin, and in the 2020 landmark Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the high court ruled that workplace sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, the Supreme Court has upheld that nondiscrimination laws are subject to a carve out, known as a \"ministerial exception,\" which permits religious organizations from being subjected to government interference in the hiring and firing of people in religious roles.\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented the school and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte, applauded the ruling.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" Luke Goodrich, Becket's vice president and senior counsel, said in a statement. \"This is a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina and Tin Fulton Walker & Owen, which represented the plaintiff, issued a statement that referenced the Bostock decision and its protection for LGBTQ workers.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" the statement said. \"While today's decision is narrowly tailored to Mr. Billard and the facts of his employment, it nonetheless threatens to encroach on that principle by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"\n\nBillard and his lawyers have 14 days to request a rehearing by the 4th Circuit or 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ACLU declined to comment on whether they would make a rehearing request or appeal.\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bostock v.

On Oct. 25, 2014, two weeks after the federal courts struck down North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, he posted about his plans to marry his longtime partner:\n\n\"Yes, I'm finally going to make an honest (at least legal) man out of Rich (Donham),\" he wrote on Facebook. \"I thank all the courageous people who had more guts than I who refused to back down and accept anything but 'equal.'\"\n\nTwo months later, on Christmas, Billard learned he'd been fired. Then, he filed suit.\n\nThe 2017 case was heard in the Western District Court of North Carolina in 2021, where CCHS waived its \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII.\n\nTitle VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Ministerial exception exempts religious organizations from anti-discrimination laws when employment decisions about their ministers are involved.\n\nAt the district court, the high school argued that it had fired Billard not because of his sex or sexual orientation, but because he engaged in \"advocacy in favor of a position that is opposed to what the church teaches about marriage.\"\n\n\"He entered a same-sex union and posted about it on Facebook,\" wrote the Catholic News Herald, the diocese's newspaper. \"That contradicted Catholic teachings about marriage and violated the diocese's employment policy, disqualifying him to assist the school in fulfilling its mission.\"\n\nBut in the appeals court Wednesday, the school moved to reinstate the ministerial exception, and the judges allowed it. The exception, the appeals court decided, immunizes CCHS's decision to fire Billard and kicks the case back down to district court.\n\nResponse to decision\n\nAn attorney for the Catholic Diocese of Charlotte could not be reached for comment. But Luke Goodrich, a lawyer representing the diocese, told the Catholic News Herald that the ruling was \"a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" he said.\n\nLuke Largess, one of Billard's attorneys, said Wednesday that the flip-flopped argument and final ruling was \"very disappointing for Mr. Billard, and a little difficult for him to understand.\"\n\nIn a statement, the ACLU, ACLU of North Carolina, and law firm Tin Fulton Walker & Owen called the decision \"heartbreaking.\"\n\nIn the statement, they said Billard \"wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves.\"\n\n\"Every worker should be entitled to equal protection under the law, and the Supreme Court held as recently as 2020 that this fundamental freedom extends to LGBTQ workers,\" the statement said. \"While today's decision is narrowly tailored to Mr. Billard and the facts of his employment, it nonetheless threatens to encroach on that principle by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"\n\nACLU vs. Becket\n\nBillard was represented by a defense team headed by ACLU attorney Joshua Block, who successfully argued before the Fourth Circuit in a landmark Virginia case upholding the rights of transgender students to use school bathrooms that match their gender identity.\n\nCCHS, Mecklenburg Area Catholic School and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte were represented -- for free -- by the Becket Fund, one of the country's most successful religious liberty law firms, The Charlotte Observer previously reported.\n\nBecket lawyers previously argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that a government mandate requiring private, Christian-owned companies to provide insurance coverage to employees for contraception violated constitutional protections. They also argued that a former football coach at a Colorado public high school could pray on the field after games.\n\nBoth arguments proved successful, as did Wednesday's.\n\nAs a teacher, the court of appeals ruled, Billard was a \"vital messenger\" of the school's faith. According to the school's statement of beliefs, he was to \"model and integrate the teachings of Jesus in all areas of conduct in order to nurture faith and inspire action.\"\n\nThat title placed him within the ministerial exception, which \"prohibits federal and state governments from becoming involved in religious leadership disputes.\"\n\n\"Catholic or not, [CCHS] requires its employees to conform to Catholic teachings,\" the court found. \"CCHS prohibits employees from engaging in or advocating for conduct contrary to the moral tenets of the Catholic faith, including the Catholic Church's rejection of same-sex marriage.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All of this indicates the performance of 'vital religious duties' that implicate the ministerial exception.\"\n\nThe panel reversed a lower court ruling in favor of Billard and remanded the case back to the district court, with instructions to enter a judgment in favor of the Catholic high school.\n\nCircuit Judge Robert B. King, a Clinton appointee, authored an opinion in which he concurred with the judgment but dissented in part. He believes the case could have been decided on the religious exemption provided in the federal Title VII civil rights law.\n\nLuke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at the religious freedom legal group Becket, who helped represent the Catholic school, released a statement celebrating the ruling.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" Goodrich said. \"This is a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina and Tin Fulton Walker & Owen, which represented Billard, released a joint statement denouncing the panel ruling.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" they stated.\n\n\"While today's decision is narrowly tailored to Mr. Billard and the facts of his employment, it nonetheless threatens to encroach on that principle by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"\n\nIn 2014, shortly after gay marriage was legalized by judicial fiat in North Carolina, Billard announced on Facebook that he and his longtime male partner were getting married.\n\nIn response, CCHS dismissed Billard for being in violation of the Catholic Diocese of Charlotte's policy prohibiting staff from engaging in actions contrary to Catholic moral teaching.\n\nWith the help of the ACLU, Billard filed a lawsuit in 2017 against the CCHS, the diocese, and Mecklenburg Area Catholic Schools, accusing them of violating his rights under Title VII.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that two Catholic schools in California were within their rights to dismiss two teachers on the basis of classifying them as \"ministers\" rather than secular professionals.\n\n\"The religious education and formation of students is the very reason for the existence of most private religious schools, and therefore the selection and supervision of the teachers upon whom the schools rely to do this work lie at the core of their mission,\" wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the majority opinion.\n\n\"Judicial review of the way in which religious schools discharge those responsibilities would undermine the independence of religious institutions in a way that the First Amendment does not tolerate.\"\n\nA dissent authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, argues that the court's decision \"strips thousands of schoolteachers of their legal protections.\"\n\n\"[T]he Court's apparent deference here threatens to make nearly anyone whom the schools might hire 'ministers' unprotected from discrimination in the hiring process,\" wrote Sotomayor.", "source": {"uri":

On May 8, the appeal was successful.\n\n\"We conclude that because Billard played a vital role as a messenger of CCHS's faith, he falls under the ministerial exception to Title VII,\" Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Pamela Harris stated in her ruling. \"Accordingly, we reverse the district court's order with instructions to enter judgment for CCHS.\"\n\nBillard has 14 days to ask the Fourth Circuit to rehear his case, or 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nBillard taught English and drama at Charlotte Catholic High School for more than a decade before eventually transitioning to a role as a regular substitute, typically working more than a dozen weeks per year. However, Billard was let go from his position in 2014 after the school discovered the Facebook post he made about his upcoming wedding.\n\nAccording to the original lawsuit, soon after the firing, then-Diocese of Charlotte spokesperson David Hains said that Billard was let go for \"going on Facebook, entering into a same-sex relationship, and saying it in a very public way that he not does not agree with the teachings of the Catholic Church.\"\n\nBillard eventually sued in 2017. His lawyers argued that his firing violated federal employment law. Specifically, the prohibitions against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. At the time, Billard said in a statement that he didn't believe his commitment to his husband \"has any bearing on [his] work in the classroom.\"\n\nThen, after the 2021 decision in his favor, Billard said in a statement that he had a \"sense of relief and a sense of vindication,\" and that the decision \"validates that [he] did nothing wrong by being a gay man.\"\n\nLawyers for Billard did not respond to a Tablet request for comment on the May 8 decision.\n\nLuke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, which represents the diocese in the case, said that the May 8 decision is a victory for all people who cherish freedom of religion.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" Goodrich said in a May 8 statement. \"This is a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"\n\nAllana-Rae Ramkissoon, an assistant superintendent of schools in the Diocese of Charlotte, said that it's important for children who attend diocesan schools to get a faithful Catholic education.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- A Catholic school in North Carolina had the right to fire a gay teacher who announced his marriage on social media a decade ago, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, reversing a judge's earlier decision.\n\nA panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, reversed a 2021 ruling that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte had violated Lonnie Billard's federal employment protections against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The school said Billard wasn't invited back as a substitute teacher because of his \"advocacy in favor of a position that is opposed to what the church teaches about marriage,\" a court document said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Max Cogburn determined Billard -- a full-time teacher for a decade until 2012 -- was a lay employee for the limited purpose of teaching secular classes. Cogburn said a trial would still have to be held to determine appropriate relief for him. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court declared Title VII also protected workers who were fired for being gay or transgender.\n\nBut Circuit Judge Pamela Harris, writing Wednesday's prevailing opinion, said that Billard fell under a \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII that courts have derived from the First Amendment that protects religious institutions in how they treat employees \"who perform tasks so central to their religious missions -- even if the tasks themselves do not advertise their religious nature.\"\n\nThat included Billard -- who primarily taught English as a substitute and who previously drama when working full-time -- because Charlotte Catholic expected instructors to integrate faith throughout the curriculum, Harris wrote. And the school's apparent expectation that Billard be ready to instruct religion as needed speaks to his role in the school's religious mission, she added.\n\n\"The record makes clear that (Charlotte Catholic) considered it \"vital\" to its religious mission that its teachers bring a Catholic perspective to bear on Shakespeare as well as on the Bible,\" wrote Harris, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama. \"Our court has recognized before that seemingly secular tasks like the teaching of English and drama may be so imbued with religious significance that they implicate the ministerial exception.\"\n\nBillard, who sued in 2017, began working at the school in 2001. He met his now-husband in 2000, and announced their decision to get married shortly after same-sex marriage was made legal in North Carolina in 2014.\n\nIn a news release, the American Civil Liberties Union and a Charlotte law firm that helped Billard file his lawsuit lamented Wednesday's reversal as \"a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves.\"\n\nThe decision threatens to encroach on the rights of LGBTQ+ workers \"by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons,\" the joint statement read.\n\nAn attorney for a group that defended the Charlotte diocese praised the decision as \"a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\" The diocese operates 20 schools across western North Carolina.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" said Luke Goodrich with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Attorneys general from nearly 20 liberal-leaning states as well as lawyers from Christian denominations and schools and other organizations filed briefs in the case.\n\nCircuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, joined Harris' opinion. Circuit Judge Robert King, a nominee of former President Bill Clinton, wrote a separate opinion, saying he agreed with the reversal while also questioning the use of the ministerial exemption. Rather, he wrote, that Charlotte Catholic fell under a separate exemption in Title VII for religious education institutions dismissing an employee.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

The school told Billard he could no longer work as a teacher because those plans violated the moral teachings of the Catholic faith.\n\nBillard sued, saying the school violated Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment.

On May 8, the appeal was successful.\n\n\"We conclude that because Billard played a vital role as a messenger of CCHS's faith, he falls under the ministerial exception to Title VII,\" Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Pamela Harris stated in her ruling. \"Accordingly, we reverse the district court's order with instructions to enter judgment for CCHS.\"\n\nBillard has 14 days to ask the Fourth Circuit to rehear his case, or 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nBillard taught English and drama at Charlotte Catholic High School for more than a decade before eventually transitioning to a role as a regular substitute, typically working more than a dozen weeks per year. However, Billard was let go from his position in 2014 after the school discovered the Facebook post he made about his upcoming wedding.\n\nAccording to the original lawsuit, soon after the firing then-Diocese of Charlotte spokesperson David Hains said that Billard was let go for \"going on Facebook, entering into a same-sex relationship, and saying it in a very public way that he not does not agree with the teachings of the Catholic Church.\"\n\nBillard eventually sued in 2017. His lawyers argued that his firing violated federal employment law. Specifically, the prohibitions against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. At the time, Billard said in a statement that he didn't believe his commitment to his husband \"has any bearing on [his] work in the classroom.\"\n\nThen, after the 2021 decision in his favor, Billard said in a statement that he had a \"sense of relief and a sense of vindication,\" and that the decision \"validates that [he] did nothing wrong by being a gay man.\"\n\nLawyers for Billard did not respond to a Crux request for comment on the May 8 decision.\n\nLuke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, which represents the diocese in the case, said that the May 8 decision is a victory for all people who cherish freedom of religion.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" Goodrich said in a May 8 statement. \"This is a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"\n\nAllana-Rae Ramkissoon, an assistant superintendent of schools in the Diocese of Charlotte, said that it's important for children who attend diocesan schools to get a faithful Catholic education.\n\n\"Many of our parents work long hours and make significant sacrifices so their children can attend our schools and receive a faithful Catholic education,\" Ramkissoon said in a May 8 statement. \"That's because we inspire our students not only to harness the lessons and tools they need to thrive, but to cherish their faith as a precious gift from God.\"", "source": {"uri": "cruxnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Crossing ideological lines, a Biden and a Reagan appointee joined to warn that a Clinton appointee's view of the case would put hundreds of thousands of people at risk of losing their jobs based on their sex, race or age.\n\nThe court ruled that Lonnie Billard, who taught English and drama before becoming a substitute teacher at a Catholic high school in Charlotte, counts as a \"minister\" who can be fired for not adhering to the Church's religious beliefs on homosexuality.\n\n\"This is a massive victory,\" said Luke Goodrich of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who argued the case. No other court, he said, had ruled that a substitute teacher who did not teach religious classes counted as a \"minister.\" \"Under the logic of this ruling, almost every teacher at almost every religious school\" could be dismissed for \"violating core religious beliefs.\"\n\nBillard announced on Facebook in October 2014 that he was engaged to his partner of 14 years, about two weeks after same-sex marriage became legal in North Carolina. He was subsequently let go from his job. The American Civil Liberties Union backed his lawsuit alleging sex discrimination.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2020 set out a broad \"ministerial exception\" to anti-discrimination laws, saying that under the First Amendment, religious organizations can decide who represents the faith. But the court also ruled recently that federal civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination. Conservative religious groups have argued that after that ruling, the ministerial exception must be even broader to allow them to maintain their belief that homosexuality and gender transition are sinful.\n\nCharlotte Catholic High School actually denied that Billard was a minister. Teachers of secular subjects at the school do not have to be Catholic and are generally discouraged from discussing religion with students, according to the court record.\n\nBut the judges concluded that Billard was still \"a vital role as a messenger of [the school's] faith.\" Teachers at the school were scored in their annual evaluations on whether their lesson plans were \"agreeable with Catholic thought.\" Billard testified that he coordinated with religion teachers to make sure his teaching of plays like \"Romeo and Juliet\" were \"in tune\" with the doctrine. Classes began with a prayer, and Billard took his students to Mass.\n\nAll that, the court argued, made him a minister who could be let go for failing to, in the school's view, properly represent Catholicism.\n\nWhile the decision is a blow to gay rights and free speech groups that represented Billard, the court said it was avoiding a legal theory that could have led to more widespread discrimination. The school had argued that a religious institution has a right to fire any employee who they see as contradicting their beliefs, whether that person is a minister or not.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that a wedding business owner could refuse to do work for a same-sex couple under the First Amendment's free speech protections. The school argued that the ruling also helped its case, and that a church school has a related right to choose not to \"associate\" with gay people. But the school's primary argument was that Billard's firing fell under a different exception written into federal civil rights law - that faith groups can choose to employ \"individuals of a particular religion.\" A district court in Texas has agreed with that interpretation.\n\nA ruling in favor of the school on those grounds could legalize not just firing of gay employees but \"race and national-origin discrimination\" as well, the majority said, as long as the decision was justified on religious grounds. \"We have understood that exemption to operate as a defense only to claims of religious discrimination - allowing religious institutions to favor co-religionists in hiring - and not to claims of race or sex discrimination,\" they said.\n\nThe ruling was written by Judge Pamela Harris, a Biden appointee, and joined by Paul V. Niemeyer, a Reagan appointee. In dissent, Judge Robert B. King, a Clinton appointee, wrote that he agreed with the decision but said the court was \"obliged\" to rule that the exception to federal civil rights law barring employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin applies. He did not respond to the majority's argument that his interpretation would allow for racial and ethnic discrimination.\n\nGoodrich dismissed those arguments as strawmen. \"You haven't seen any of those hypotheticals manifest, and there's multiple reasons for that,\" he said, including that other federal laws explicitly bar racial and ethnic bias in employment. When the court held public arguments over this case last year, Harris suggested those are also under threat. The Trump administration tried to limit enforcement of one law Goodrich cited; the Supreme Court recently raised the bar for proving bias under another.\n\n\"That is very much an active issue,\" Harris said. \"I don't think we should consider that sort of a stable area of the law.\"\n\nBut Goodrich argued that religious justifications for firings are rare, while a broader ministerial exception gives religious groups far more power to fire employees without fear of a lawsuit. The Supreme Court has ruled it applies to claims of discrimination based on age or disability.\n\nUnder this ruling, he said, \"the vast majority of claims are barred for pretty much every teacher in every religious school.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-discrimination law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_V._Niemeyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul V.

And the school's apparent expectation that Billard be ready to instruct religion as needed speaks to his role in the school's religious mission, she added.\n\n\"The record makes clear that (Charlotte Catholic) considered it \"vital\" to its religious mission that its teachers bring a Catholic perspective to bear on Shakespeare as well as on the Bible,\" wrote Harris, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama. \"Our court has recognized before that seemingly secular tasks like the teaching of English and drama may be so imbued with religious significance that they implicate the ministerial exception.\"\n\nBillard, who sued in 2017, began working at the school in 2001. He met his now-husband in 2000, and announced their decision to get married shortly after same-sex marriage was made legal in North Carolina in 2014.\n\nIn a news release, the American Civil Liberties Union and a Charlotte law firm that helped Billard file his lawsuit lamented Wednesday's reversal as \"a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves.\"\n\nThe decision threatens to encroach on the rights of LGBTQ+ workers \"by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons,\" the joint statement read.\n\nAn attorney for a group that defended the Charlotte diocese praised the decision as \"a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\" The diocese operates 20 schools across western North Carolina.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" said Luke Goodrich with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Attorneys general from nearly 20 liberal-leaning states as well as lawyers from Christian denominations and schools and other organizations filed briefs in the case.\n\nCircuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, joined Harris' opinion. Circuit Judge Robert King, a nominee of former President Bill Clinton, wrote a separate opinion, saying he agreed with the reversal while also questioning the use of the ministerial exemption. Rather, he wrote, that Charlotte Catholic fell under a separate exemption in Title VII for religious education institutions dismissing an employee.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

School officials said they would no longer employ him when his intentions became known, and he sued alleging sex discrimination.\n\nA federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, allowed Mr. Billard's case to proceed, but a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision Wednesday.\n\nThe judges said the Catholic school's choices are covered by the \"ministerial exception\" allowing religious institutions to designate employees as being responsible for the transmission of faith to students.\n\n\"Many of our parents work long hours and make significant sacrifices so their children can attend our schools and receive a faithful Catholic education,\" said Allana Ramkissoon, assistant superintendent of schools for the Diocese of Charlotte, which oversees the school. \"That's because we inspire our students not only to harness the lessons and tools they need to thrive, but to cherish their faith as a precious gift from God.\"\n\nBy announcing his wedding plans, Mr. Billard violated the school's prohibition against \"engaging in or advocating for conduct contrary to the moral tenets of the Catholic faith, including the Catholic Church's rejection of same-sex marriage,\" the court wrote.\n\nWhat's more, Mr. Billard was expected to align his teaching -- both as a full-time drama teacher and then as a substitute teaching English -- with Catholic beliefs, the court said.\n\n\"Even as a teacher of English and drama, Billard's duties included conforming his instruction to Christian thought and providing a classroom environment consistent with Catholicism. Billard may have been teaching Romeo and Juliet, but he was doing so after consultation with religious teachers to ensure that he was teaching through a faith-based lens,\" the judges said.\n\nThe 4th Circuit ruling follows a 2023 decision by the 7th Circuit allowing a Catholic high school in Indianapolis to fire a guidance counselor whose same-sex marriage violated the school's employment contract.\n\nRoncalli High School also had won a challenge by guidance counselor Lynn Starkey, who sued when her employment contract wasn't renewed because of her same-sex marriage.\n\nMr. Billard's legal team, consisting of the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina and the law firm of Tin Fulton Walker & Owen, decried Wednesday's ruling.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client, who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThe attorneys said the ruling \"threatens to encroach\" on the principle that workers should receive equal treatment under the law.\n\nAn ACLU of North Carolina spokesperson did not respond when asked if the ruling would be appealed. Mr. Billard has 14 days to ask for a rehearing by the full 4th Circuit or 90 days to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.\n\nAn attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, representing the Charlotte diocese and high school, said the ruling protects Catholic schools and other religious groups.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has been crystal clear on this issue: Catholic schools have the freedom to choose teachers who fully support Catholic teaching,\" said Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at the public-interest law firm. \"This is a victory for people of all faiths who cherish the freedom to pass on their faith to the next generation.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_a_kellner@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Mark A.

Although the school offers both secular and religious curriculum, religion is infused into many aspects of daily life at the school. According to the court's findings, the school's teaching staff plays \"a critical role\" in pursuing its religious mission. Teachers are expected to begin each class with a short prayer, to accompany students to and supervise their attendance at mass, and to teach their students in a manner \"agreeable with Catholic thought.\" It also evaluates its teachers on the \"catholicity\" of their classroom environment.\n\nCCHS does not require all its employees to be Catholic, but does require its employees to conform to Catholic teachings and prohibits them from engaging in or advocating conduct that conflicts with tenets of Catholicism -- including a requirement that the employees reject same-sex marriage.\n\nBillard has worked at CCHS since 2001 after he began as a substitute teacher. During that time, Billard taught drama and English and occasionally substituted for religion teachers. The panel noted that, \"Billard appears to have been an excellent and beloved teacher,\" and mentioned that he won multiple awards over the years including the Charlotte Catholic Teacher of the Year award.\n\nBillard had no responsibility to teach religion directly, and instead, referred any questions about religion to religious authorities just as the school preferred.\n\nIn 2014, shortly after North Carolina legalized same-sex marriage, Billard posted on Facebook that he planned to marry his longtime partner. CCHS learned of the post and opted to terminate Billard's employment.\n\nBillard sued for sex discrimination under Title VII. CCHS did not contest that it discriminated against Billard, but rather, argued that it had the right to discriminate under the \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII.\n\nA 'potent' exception dubs teachers 'ministers'\n\nAlthough the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that firing someone for being gay is illegal under Title VII, a relatively new exception to that rule -- which one Supreme Court justice has denounced as being an \"extraordinarily potent\" method of \"giv[ing] an employer free rein to discriminate because of race, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, or other traits protected by law\" -- allows religious schools the latitude to discriminate without legal consequences.\n\nThe \"ministerial exception\" grew from a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that churches have full freedom to decide who will hold a position as a religious leader. In 2020, the justices expanded the ministerial exception to say that teachers also count as \"ministers\" for purposes of anti-discrimination law. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the application of the exception to teachers \"staggering\" and warned that it could lead to disastrous consequences for educators.\n\nA partially divided court\n\nThe panel of the Fourth Circuit included U.S. Circuit Judges Paul Niemeyer, a George H.W. Bush appointee, Robert Bruce King, a Bill Clinton appointee, and Pamela Harris, a Barack Obama appointee. The three unanimously supported the decision to overturn Billard's district court win, but were split 2-1 in their reasoning.\n\nHarris wrote for the panel and defended the ministerial exception as a mechanism that does not simply protect the church, but rather, \"also confines the state and its civil courts to their proper roles.\" The judge also clarified that the panel's ruling against Billard was tied directly to mandates handed down by the Supreme Court.\n\nHarris looked to the high court's recent rulings involving teachers at religious schools and concluded that CCHS \"entrusted Billard with 'vital religious duties,' making him a 'messenger' of its faith and placing him within the ministerial exception.\" Harris acknowledged that Billard was not a religion teacher per se, but said that, \"Even as a teacher of English and drama, Billard's duties included conforming his instruction to Christian thought and providing a classroom environment consistent with Catholicism.\"\n\n\"Billard may have been teaching Romeo and Juliet, but he was doing so after consultation with religious teachers to ensure that he was teaching through a faith-based lens,\" Harris wrote.\n\nHarris qualified that not all employees of a religious school would fall within the ministerial exception.\n\n\"But as the Supreme Court instructs, teachers are different,\" Harris said.\n\nIn a partial dissent, King said he agreed with the ruling, but would not have decided the case under the ministerial exception. Rather, King said, the case should have been decided under a more general exemption in Title VII applicable to religious employers. King said that the panel's majority wrongly abandoned the doctrine of constitutional avoidance by invoking the ministerial exception when the case could have been decided otherwise.\n\nDuring oral arguments in September, the issue of whether an employer can waive the ministerial exception unexpectedly came up as an issue before the panel. CCHS had initially represented to the district court that it had waived the ministerial exception, and the Fourth Circuit questioned the parties at arguments as to whether waiver of the exception is even possible. Ultimately, the panel ruled that even if there had been or could be a waiver, \"we ought to forgive it here\" -- thus leaving the ministerial exception available to defend CCHS' sex-based discrimination.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Charlotte", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-discrimination law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parochial_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parochial school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_V._Niemeyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul V.

The exception, set by the United States Supreme Court, exempts religious institutions from certain discrimination laws in ministerial roles when such laws would prevent them from adhering to their mission of ministering the faith.", "source": {"uri": "catholicnewsagency.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Catholic News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romeo and Juliet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/shutterstock_343131818.jpg?jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551143", "eventUri": "eng-9551143", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Crossing ideological lines, an Obama and a Reagan appointee joined to warn that a Clinton appointee's view of the case would put hundreds of thousands of people at risk of losing their jobs based on their sex, race or age.\n\nThe court ruled that Lonnie Billard, who taught English and drama before becoming a substitute teacher at a Catholic high school in Charlotte, counts as a \"minister\" who can be fired for not adhering to the Church's religious beliefs on homosexuality.\n\n\"This is a massive victory,\" said Luke Goodrich of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who argued the case. No other court, he said, had ruled that a substitute teacher who did not teach religious classes counted as a \"minister.\" \"Under the logic of this ruling, almost every teacher at almost every religious school\" could be dismissed for \"violating core religious beliefs.\"\n\nBillard announced on Facebook in October 2014 that he was engaged to his partner of 14 years, about two weeks after same-sex marriage became legal in North Carolina. He was subsequently let go from his job. The American Civil Liberties Union backed his lawsuit alleging sex discrimination.\n\nIn a statement, the ACLU called the decision \"heartbreaking\" and condemned \"widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2020 set out a broad \"ministerial exception\" to anti-discrimination laws, saying that under the First Amendment, religious organizations can decide who represents the faith. But the court also ruled recently that federal civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination. Conservative religious groups have argued that after that ruling, the ministerial exception must be even broader to allow them to maintain their belief that homosexuality and gender transition are sinful.\n\nCharlotte Catholic High School actually denied that Billard was a minister. Teachers of secular subjects at the school do not have to be Catholic and are generally discouraged from discussing religion with students, according to the court record.\n\nBut the judges concluded that Billard was still \"a vital role as a messenger of [the school's] faith.\" Teachers at the school were scored in their annual evaluations on whether their lesson plans were \"agreeable with Catholic thought.\" Billard testified that he coordinated with religion teachers to make sure his teaching of plays like \"Romeo and Juliet\" were \"in tune\" with the doctrine. Classes began with a prayer, and Billard took his students to Mass.\n\nAll that, the court argued, made him a minister who could be let go for failing to, in the school's view, properly represent Catholicism.\n\nWhile the decision is a blow to gay rights and free speech groups that represented Billard, the court said it was avoiding a legal theory that could have led to more widespread discrimination. The school had argued that a religious institution has a right to fire any employee who they see as contradicting their beliefs, whether that person is a minister or not.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that a wedding business owner could refuse to do work for a same-sex couple under the First Amendment's free speech protections. The school argued that the ruling also helped its case, and that a church school has a related right to choose not to \"associate\" with gay people. But the school's primary argument was that Billard's firing fell under a different exception written into federal civil rights law - that faith groups can choose to employ \"individuals of a particular religion.\" A district court in Texas has agreed with that interpretation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA ruling in favor of the school on those grounds could legalize not just firing of gay employees but \"race and national-origin discrimination\" as well, the majority said, as long as the decision was justified on religious grounds. \"We have understood that exemption to operate as a defense only to claims of religious discrimination - allowing religious institutions to favor co-religionists in hiring - and not to claims of race or sex discrimination,\" they said.\n\nThe ruling was written by Judge Pamela Harris, a Biden appointee, and joined by Paul V. Niemeyer, a Reagan appointee. In dissent, Judge Robert B. King, a Clinton appointee, wrote that he agreed with the decision but said the court was \"obliged\" to rule that the exception to federal civil rights law barring employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin applies. He did not respond to the majority's argument that his interpretation would allow for racial and ethnic discrimination.\n\nGoodrich dismissed those arguments as strawmen. \"You haven't seen any of those hypotheticals manifest, and there's multiple reasons for that,\" he said, including that other federal laws explicitly bar racial and ethnic bias in employment. When the court held public arguments over this case last year, Harris suggested those are also under threat. The Trump administration tried to limit enforcement of one law Goodrich cited; the Supreme Court recently raised the bar for proving bias under another.\n\n\"That is very much an active issue,\" Harris said. \"I don't think we should consider that sort of a stable area of the law.\"\n\nBut Goodrich argued that religious justifications for firings are rare, while a broader ministerial exception gives religious groups far more power to fire employees without fear of a lawsuit. The Supreme Court has ruled it applies to claims of discrimination based on age or disability.\n\nUnder this ruling, he said, \"the vast majority of claims are barred for pretty much every teacher in every religious school.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nSpike in road fatalities prompts Maine officials to urge driver safety filed under: LGBTQ Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-discrimination law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_V._Niemeyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul V.

On Oct. 25, 2014, two weeks after the federal courts struck down North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, he posted his plans to marry his longtime partner:\n\n\"Yes, I'm finally going to make an honest (at least legal) man out of Rich (Donham),\" he wrote on Facebook. \"I thank all the courageous people who had more guts than I who refused to back down and accept anything but 'equal.'\"\n\nTwo months later, on Christmas, Billard learned he'd been fired. Then, he filed suit.\n\nThe 2017 case was heard in the Western District Court of North Carolina in 2021, where CCHS waived its \"ministerial exception\" to Title VII, , which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\n\nInstead it argued that it had fired him not because of his sex or sexual orientation, but because he engaged in \"advocacy in favor of a position that is opposed to what the church teaches about marriage.\"\n\nIn the appeals court Wednesday, the school moved to reinstate the exception, and the judges allowed it.\n\nThe flip-flopped argument and final ruling was \"very disappointing for Mr. Billard, and a little difficult for him to understand,\" said Luke Largess, one of Billard's attorneys.\n\nThe ministerial exception, the appeals court decided, immunizes CCHS's decision to fire Billard and kicks the case back down to district court.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" read a statement from the ACLU, ACLU of North Carolina, and law firm Tin Fulton Walker & Owen in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"While today's decision is narrowly tailored to Mr. Billard and the facts of his employment, it nonetheless threatens to encroach on that principle by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"\n\nAs a teacher, the court of appeals ruled, Billard was a \"vital messenger\" of the school's faith. According to the school's statement of beliefs, he was to \"model and integrate the teachings of Jesus in all areas of conduct in order to nurture faith and inspire action.\"\n\nThat title placed him within the ministerial exception, which \"prohibits federal and state governments from becoming involved in religious leadership disputes.\"\n\n\"Catholic or not, [CCHS] requires its employees to conform to Catholic teachings,\" the court found. \"CCHS prohibits employees from engaging in or advocating for conduct contrary to the moral tenets of the Catholic faith, including the Catholic

He sued the school in 2017, when the school stopped asking him to work, claiming that the school engaged in sex discrimination.\n\nA federal court ruled in favor of Billard back in 2021, but an appellate court overturned that ruling on Wednesday and found that the school was protected under the First Amendment's right to religious freedom.\n\n\"Faith infused [the school's] classes -- and not only the expressly religious ones,\" the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in its decision.\n\n\"Even as a teacher of English and drama, Billard's duties included conforming his instruction to Christian thought and providing a classroom environment consistent with Catholicism,\" the decision read. \"Billard may have been teaching 'Romeo and Juliet,' but he was doing so after consultation with religious teachers to ensure that he was teaching through a faith-based lens.\"\n\nIn addressing discrimination laws, the court found that the school is constitutionally protected under the \"ministerial exception\" in its hiring and firing decisions for that position because the role requires the person to minister the faith to students. The exception, set by the United States Supreme Court, exempts religious institutions from certain discrimination laws in ministerial roles when such laws would prevent them from adhering to their mission of ministering the faith.\n\n\"The ministerial exception protects religious institutions in their dealings with individuals who perform tasks so central to their religious missions -- even if the tasks themselves do not advertise their religious nature,\" the court found.\n\n\"The ministerial exception remains just that -- an exception -- and each case must be judged on its own facts to determine whether a 'particular position' falls within the exception's scope,\" the court stated. \"But when the exception does apply, it unambiguously commands that [the courts] 'stay out' [of these decisions].\"\n\nBillard was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU issued a statement criticizing the court's decision.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves,\" the statement read. \"Every worker should be entitled to equal protection under the law, and the Supreme Court held as recently as 2020 that this fundamental freedom extends to LGBTQ workers.\"\n\nGoodrich said in a post on X that the court's decision is in line with long-standing precedent on religious freedom.\n\n\"The court's ruling is consistent with a long line of Supreme Court precedent upholding the freedom of religious schools to select teachers who uphold their faith,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Billard's employment at the school had been conditional on an agreement to uphold Catholic teaching.\n\nThe court found that the ministerial exception, which allows religious institutions to discriminate against certain protected classes if it is necessary for the ministry of their religion, applied to Billard and therefore the diocese was justified in firing him.\n\n\"Even as a teacher of English and drama, Billard's duties included conforming his instruction to Christian thought and providing a classroom environment consistent with Catholicism,\" the three-judge panel that included one Republican and two Democratic appointees wrote. \"The record makes clear that CCHS considered it 'vital' to its religious mission that its teachers bring a Catholic perspective to bear on Shakespeare as well as on the Bible.\"\n\n\"Under all the relevant circumstances here, we think this teacher falls within the narrow category of employees who 'serve as a messenger or teacher of the faith' covered by the ministerial exception,\" the court added.\n\nThe ruling fits into several Supreme Court precedents that have repeatedly upheld religious freedom protections, even when this right has seemingly been in tension with federal civil rights law. The ministerial exception itself was a product of the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile it is an encouraging sign to see courts continue to defend the right to religious freedom, the very fact that the Diocese of Charlotte and CCHS were forced to go to court to defend their right to expect certain moral behavior from its employees indicates an enduring intolerance for religion by a group of people that is all too eager to run to the American Civil Liberties Union and force these institutions to defend themselves.\n\nBillard had no right to expect employment from Charlotte Catholic High School when it was clear he had violated the employment agreement that he had made with the school and the diocese. Instead of humbly accepting that reality, Billard sought to force the Catholic high school to conform to his way of life. Perhaps this court defeat will allow him the opportunity to reflect on his religious bigotry.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremiah_poff@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Jeremiah Poff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Charlotte", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian theology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diocese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious persecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lutheranism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iStock-1483489085.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551143", "eventUri": "eng-9551143", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In October 2014, Lonnie wrote a Facebook post announcing that he and his long-time partner were getting married. Later that year, the school told Lonnie he could no longer work as a substitute teacher because his engagement and marriage to another man was contrary to the religious principles of the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 2017, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Mr. Billard by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina, and Tin Fulton Walker & Owen. On September 3, 2021, a federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Billard, holding that Defendants violated Mr. Billard's rights under Title VII and that Defendants do not have statutory or constitutional right to engage in sex discrimination against non-ministerial employees. CCHS appealed to the Fourth Circuit arguing Mr. Billard's role as a teacher was ministerial, an argument the Fourth Circuit agreed with today.\n\nThe ACLU, ACLU of North Carolina, and Tin Fulton Walker & Owen issued the following joint statement:\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking decision for our client who wanted nothing more than the freedom to perform his duties as an educator without hiding who he is or who he loves. Every worker should be entitled to equal protection under the law, and the Supreme Court held as recently as 2020 that this fundamental freedom extends to LGBTQ workers. While today's decision is narrowly tailored to Mr. Billard and the facts of his employment, it nonetheless threatens to encroach on that principle by widening the loopholes employers may use to fire people like Mr. Billard for openly discriminatory reasons.\"", "source": {"uri": "eriegaynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Erie Gay News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_exception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministerial exception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulton Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strict scrutiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal Protection Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.eriegaynews.com/images/logos/2023/North-Carolina-state-flag.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551143", "eventUri": "eng-9551143", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-10-", "textStart": 607, "textEnd": 619}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But the school stopped using him as a substitute teacher in 2014 after he posted on Facebook that he was marrying his male partner.\n\n\"The school just decided peacefully we're just not going to call him back as a substitute. No ill will, it's just if you're gonna teach at a Catholic school and pass on the Catholic faith to the next generation, you need to be supportive of Catholic Church teachings,\" said Luke Goodrich, an attorney for Charlotte Catholic High School.\n\nBillard sued in 2017 saying he was discriminated against because of his sexual orientation. Last year, a federal district court agreed with him, but on Wednesday, an appeals court reversed that decision.\n\nRELATED: Court of Appeals hears case of gay Charlotte Catholic teacher fired from job\n\nBillard's attorney pointed out that the school didn't argue for a \"ministerial exception\" in court and said that the law changed while the case was ongoing. That happened in a Supreme Court ruling on a case known as \"Our Lady of Guadalupe.\"\n\n\"That decision came out after [the judge's] order finding that Lonnie was not a minister under the prior supreme court ruling. So part of what the 4th Circuit is doing here is saying no, we have to apply this most recent supreme court ruling to Lonnie's facts,\" said Luke Largess, Billard's attorney.\n\nHe can still appeal for the 4th Circuit to hear the case again with a full panel of judges, and it could go to the Supreme Court.

{"id": 223681814, "title": "Bridesmaid Backed for Secretly Walking out of Bride's Dress Appointment", "text": "A bridesmaid has shared her dilemma after she walked out of a dress viewing after discovering damning texts between the maid of honor and bride.Reddit user u/Necessary-Wall-6446 shared her conundrum on Reddit, asking if what she did was wrong. The 23-year-old said the three were college roommates and stayed in the same city after graduation, but she added that Gaby, the maid of honor, and Shelly, the bride, are closer to each other than her.The poster said she went with Shelly to try on wedding dresses, but Gaby was called into work last minute, so she had the duty of taking photos and videos to share.When the poster was about to take a photo, a message from Gaby popped up. When she accidentally clicked on it, she was not prepared for what she saw.She wrote: \"I didn't mean to click on it and was instantly going to click back out when I saw one of my Instagram pictures in their private chat from earlier that morning.\"Both were making fun of me for the face I was making and my outfit choice. It didn't appear to be very good-natured.\"The woman said that curiosity got the best of her. She searched her name in the chat chain and found the duo ripping into photos she, her mom or boyfriend had posted, ranging from selfies to baby photos.The poster added: \"As someone who was bullied all through middle and high school, it just brought me back to a horrible place.\"Devastated, she slammed the phone back into Shelly's purse and gave it to a staff member, whom she asked to pass on the message that she had to leave.Shelly asked her where she had been, and later when they spoke on the phone, the hurt bridesmaid said that she had seen the texts between her friends.The bride allegedly defended her actions and said they were private texts all in good fun and that the poster should not have left the store without saying anything.Gaby called her to defend Shelly, saying the poster had invaded her privacy and hurt her by walking out.The bridesmaid said her mom and boyfriend think she did the right thing, but she wanted advice from an unconnected source.One user @hereforyounot commented: \"If I was in your place, I think I'd drop out of being in the wedding. It's one thing to jokingly make fun of someone one time but seems like they have done this to you a bunch of times.\"And it doesn't seem like it was lighthearted. If I was you I wouldn't feel bad about looking through those messages at all, she handed her phone to you and feels like fate took the opportunity to expose them to you for who they are.\"What Do the Experts Think?Rachel Goldberg, a psychotherapist from Los Angeles, California, told Newsweek about her take on the dilemma and agreed with @hereforyounot. She said that there are several reasons the author did the right thing.Firstly, Goldberg said that the bridesmaid needed time to process the pain induced by what she had just said. The psychotherapist agreed with the poster, who could have made a scene in confronting the bride in the store and been blamed for ruining the wedding shopping experience.Goldberg added: \"To make matters worse, instead of taking responsibility for how Shelly and Gaby had treated the relationship, they blamed the author for invading Shelly's privacy\u2014a reaction most people would have had in her situation when unexpectedly seeing their name used in such a hurtful manner.\"At this point, the author needs to rethink the relationship. It may be time for her to move on, heal, and find new friends,\" Goldberg added.Ricki Romm, a psychotherapist from New York, told Newsweek, that, although the author was wrong to open the chat, her hurt was extremely valid. She said it was concerning that neither of the friends acknowledged how hurtful the situation was.However, Romm added: \"I would love for the writer to give this another shot before walking away from the friendship.\"She said the poster should send this message: \"I'm sorry I read your private messages, I shouldn't have done that and would never do it again.\"I also feel really sad and angry about what I saw because I thought you were my friends and those texts sure don't sound like it. I wish you could acknowledge my feelings and tell me why you've been speaking behind my back.\"", "summary": "Trying on wedding dresses should be a happy occasion, but one bridesmaid said she walked out after a hurtful betrayal.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/wedding-dress-store-try-bridesmaid-maid-honor-1903420", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2397359/stock-image-wedding-dress-try.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:30:01", "author": "Lydia Patrick", "authors": ["Lydia Patrick"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.356}

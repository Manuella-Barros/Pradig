During the Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, June 7, the One Day at a Time star, 64, caught up with PEOPLE about her bicoastal relationship with Goodnough \u2014 and how the duo intend to spend their summers together. \"In the middle of making [summer plans], we'll see what happens. You know, but it is long distance and we'll just rack up some more miles,\" the celebrity chef said, before describing the pros \u2014 and the cons \u2014 of living so far apart. Goodnough lives on the East Coast, while the celebrity chef resides in Los Angeles. \"Well, the biggest pro is that every time you see each other, especially when you haven't seen each other for a week or two, it just feels great and all the butterflies kind of kick in again,\" she said. \"And [the] difficult [part] is, you just want to see each other all the time. I mean, I hate being apart from him.\" Goodnough, who made his red carpet debut with Bertinelli at the event, added that it \"feels great\" to support his partner at the Daytime Emmys. \"I mean, there's really, there's very little better than seeing somebody you love get the recognition, get the roses, it's just, it's a great night,\" he said. Bertinelli was nominated for two awards this weekend for her work on her now-canceled Food Network series Valerie's Home Cooking and explained to PEOPLE what it is that enables her to stay vulnerable with her audience. \"I just feel like whatever I say, whatever I do, this is me now. I mean, it's always been me, but I'm just a little bit more relaxed in who I am,\" she said. \"So, I'm super appreciative that people have welcomed me. So, I'll just keep being who I am, as authentically as I can.\" Goodnough, also known as Hoarse Whisperer on social media, previously described his thoughts on doing things long distance with his partner. Alongside a post on Instagram on April 30, Goodnough shared that \"the problem with long-distance relationships is, well, you know\u2026 the distance. Hard to be far when you just want to be close.\u201d \u201cOn the bright side, it makes the time together that much more valuable,\" he added.

They've since established a \u201cthree-week rule\u201d to ensure that they make time for visits. \u201cWe never go longer than that without seeing each other,\u201d the actress previously said. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s about finding the joy in life and sharing it.\u201d", "summary": "&#34;You just want to see each other all the time,&#34; the celebrity chef tells PEOPLE at the Daytime Emmys", "url": "https://people.com/valerie-bertinelli-on-doing-long-distance-with-mike-goodnough-exclusive-8660489", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/jtbMPO3aDWOrY-aFtfvnG1DiMUI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1020x368:1022x370)/Valerie-Bertinelli-Mike-Goodnough-060824-02-3ae6566f152948b78bed1641004bb6ca.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:10:18", "author": "Brenton Blanchet,Nathan Vinson", "authors": ["Brenton Blanchet", "Nathan Vinson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.623}

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes struck in and near a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name":

Police have been clearing a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University since dozens of protesters left the site and marched to President Ellen Granberg's home. The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department says arrests were made for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Mayor Muriel Bowser and MPD Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the District of Columbia's handling of the protest at a House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing on Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nUS paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion, official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns that Israel was approaching a decision on launching a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. That's according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nTrump in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in the courtroom listening to salacious details of an affair he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him on stage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an Apprentice-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia hits Ukraine's power grid with a 'massive' attack on a day marking the WWII defeat of Nazism\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. The attack occurred on the day Ukraine celebrates the defeat of Nazism in World War II. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nA ship carrying the Olympic torch arrives in Marseille amid fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Excitement is building in the southern French city of Marseille, where a majestic three-mast ship carrying the Olympic torch arrived from Greece ahead of a welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday. Paris Games organizers have promised \"fantastic\" celebrations in the city, where the Old Port has been placed under high security. The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a ship named Belem, which was first used in 1896, and spent twelve days at sea. About 8,000 police officers have been deployed around in the harbour where tens of thousands of spectators are expected to gather for the ceremony.\n\nMore from this section\n\nLong Time Ferret

Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nA ship carrying the Olympic torch arrives in Marseille amid fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Excitement is building in the southern French city of Marseille, where a majestic three-mast ship carrying the Olympic torch arrived from Greece ahead of a welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday. Paris Games organizers have promised \"fantastic\" celebrations in the city, where the Old Port has been placed under high security. The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a ship named Belem, which was first used in 1896, and spent twelve days at sea. About 8,000 police officers have been deployed around in the harbour where tens of thousands of spectators are expected to gather for the ceremony.\n\nMore from this section\n\nA look at commencement

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPolice clearing pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University, dozens arrested\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Police have begun to clear a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University, hours after dozens of protesters left the site and marched to President Ellen Granberg's home. According to event organizers, nearly 30 people were arrested as police used pepper spray to contain the crowd. The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department says arrests were made for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry, but a number of arrests wasn't immediately given. Mayor Muriel Bowser and MPD Chief Pamela Smith are set to testify about the District of Columbia's handling of the protest at a House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInside the courtroom where Trump was forced to listen to Stormy Daniels\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump squirmed and scowled, shook his head and muttered as Stormy Daniels described the unexpected sex she says they had in a hotel nearly two decades ago. It was a story Daniels has told before. This time, Trump had no choice but to sit and listen. Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia hits Ukraine's power grid with a 'massive' attack on a day marking the WWII defeat of Nazism\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. The attack occurred on the day Ukraine celebrates the defeat of Nazism in World War II. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nStorms battering the Midwest bring tornadoes, hail and strong winds\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms have battered parts of the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region. Tuesday's severe weather outbreak came a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person. Forecasters warned that the storms could could spill out of the region Wednesday morning. Tornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two of them blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and left more than 20,000 without power on Tuesday night. But officials say there weren't any serious injuries immediately reported.\n\nThe Olympic torch is being welcomed in French port city of Marseille with fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Paris Games organizers are promising \"fantastic\" celebrations to welcome the Olympic torch in the southern city of Marseille. The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices.

The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington, D.C., mayor and police chief say they decided to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment at George Washington University based on shifting information about increased threats to public safety. Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia hits Ukraine's power grid with a 'massive' attack on a day marking the WWII defeat of Nazism\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. The attack occurred on the day Ukraine celebrates the defeat of Nazism in World War II. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nA ship carrying the Olympic torch arrives in Marseille amid fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Excitement is building in the southern French city of Marseille, where a majestic three-mast ship carrying the Olympic torch arrived from Greece ahead of a welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday. Paris Games organizers have promised \"fantastic\" celebrations in the city, where the Old Port has been placed under high security. The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a ship named Belem, which was first used in 1896, and spent twelve days at sea. About 8,000 police officers have been deployed around in the harbour where tens of thousands of spectators are expected to gather for the ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\n33 are arrested at George Washington University as DC mayor's congressional hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The House oversight committee has canceled a hearing with the District of Columbia's mayor over a university pro-Palestinian encampment shortly after 33 protesters were arrested. Police cleared the George Washington University tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says arrests were made for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry and pepper spray was used against proters trying to break police lines. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing on Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia hits Ukraine's power grid with a 'massive' attack on a day marking the WWII defeat of Nazism\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. The attack occurred on the day Ukraine celebrates the defeat of Nazism in World War II. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nA ship carrying the Olympic torch arrives in Marseille amid fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Excitement is building in the southern French city of Marseille, where a majestic three-mast ship carrying the Olympic torch arrived from Greece ahead of a welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday.

The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington, D.C., mayor and police chief say they decided to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment at George Washington University based on shifting information about increased threats to public safety. Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden heads to Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is racing into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday is traveling to Racine, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center that's expected to create roughly 2,000 jobs. It's also the spot where former President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy as his own reelection campaign readies a new $14 million advertising blitz aimed in part at Black, Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nA scorching, rocky planet twice Earth's size has a thick atmosphere, scientists say\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- A thick atmosphere has been detected around a planet that's twice as big as Earth in a nearby solar system. Researchers reported Wednesday that the rocky planet 55 Cancri e is wrapped in a blanket of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, making it one of the few planets outside our solar system to have a thick atmosphere. While the planet is covered by magma oceans and is likely too hot for life to survive, scientists say it's a promising sign that other such rocky planets with bulky atmospheres could be more hospitable. The research was published in the journal Nature.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nA ship carrying the Olympic torch arrives in Marseille amid fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Excitement is building in the southern French city of Marseille, where a majestic three-mast ship carrying the Olympic torch arrived from Greece ahead of a welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday. Paris Games organizers have promised \"fantastic\" celebrations in the city, where the Old Port has been placed under high security. The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a ship named Belem, which was first used in 1896, and spent twelve days at sea. About 8,000 police officers have been deployed around in the harbour where tens of thousands of spectators are expected to gather for the ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. The attack occurred on the day Ukraine celebrates the defeat of Nazism in World War II.

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPolice clearing Pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University, dozens arrested\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Police have begun to clear a Pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University, hours after dozens of protesters left the site and marched to President Ellen Granberg's home. According to event organizers, nearly 30 people were arrested as police used pepper spray to contain the crowd. The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department says arrests were made for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry, but a number of arrests wasn't immediately given. Mayor Muriel Bowser and MPD Chief Pamela Smith are set to testify about the District of Columbia's handling of the protest at a House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInside the courtroom where Trump was forced to listen to Stormy Daniels\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump squirmed and scowled, shook his head and muttered as Stormy Daniels described the unexpected sex she says they had in a hotel nearly two decades ago. It was a story Daniels has told before. This time, Trump had no choice but to sit and listen. Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia launches a 'massive' missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy facilities\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nUS and Philippine forces sink a ship during largescale drills in the disputed South China Sea\n\nLAOAG, Philippines (AP) -- U.S. and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, have unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing. Military officials and diplomats watched the display of firepower from a hilltop on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last year, the Philippines approved a wider U.S. military presence in the archipelago. China opposed the move, which puts U.S. forces across the sea from Taiwan. The Philippines countered it has the right to defend its sovereignty.\n\nStorms battering the Midwest bring tornadoes, hail and strong winds\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms have battered parts of the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region. Tuesday's severe weather outbreak came a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person. Forecasters warned that the storms could could spill out of the region Wednesday morning. Tornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two of them blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and left more than 20,000 without power on Tuesday night. But officials say there weren't any serious injuries immediately reported.\n\nThe Olympic torch is being welcomed in French port city of Marseille with fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Paris Games organizers are promising \"fantastic\" celebrations to welcome the Olympic torch in the southern city of Marseille. The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name":

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPolice clear Pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University, dozens arrested\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Police have begun to clear a Pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., hours after dozens of protesters left the site and marched to President Ellen Granberg's home. GW Hatchet, the university's student-run newspaper said officers gave a third and final warning to demonstrators at about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday that all who remained at the encampment would be arrested. According to event organizers, nearly 30 people were arrested as police used pepper spray to contain the crowd. Mayor Muriel Bowser and MPD Chief Pamela Smith are set to testify about the District's handling of the protest at a House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInside the courtroom where Trump was forced to listen to Stormy Daniels\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump squirmed and scowled, shook his head and muttered as Stormy Daniels described the unexpected sex she says they had in a hotel nearly two decades ago. It was a story Daniels has told before. This time, Trump had no choice but to sit and listen. Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nRussia launches a 'massive' missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy facilities\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's president says Russia has launched a massive nighttime attack on energy facilities across Ukraine, targeting seven regions with more than 50 missiles and drones. Officials say the bombardment blasted targets in areas including Kyiv and parts of the south and west, damaging homes and the country's rail network. Three people, including an 8-year-old girl, were injured. Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the war that is stretching into its third year and has claimed thousands of lives. By taking out power, the Kremlin's forces aim to rob Ukrainian manufacturing of its energy supply, especially military plants, and crush public morale.\n\nUS and Philippine forces sink a ship during largescale drills in the disputed South China Sea\n\nLAOAG, Philippines (AP) -- U.S. and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, have unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing. Military officials and diplomats watched the display of firepower from a hilltop on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last year, the Philippines approved a wider U.S. military presence in the archipelago. China opposed the move, which puts U.S. forces across the sea from Taiwan. The Philippines countered it has the right to defend its sovereignty.\n\nStorms battering the Midwest bring tornadoes, hail and strong winds\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms have battered parts of the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region. Tuesday's severe weather outbreak came a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person. Forecasters warned that the storms could could spill out of the region Wednesday morning. Tornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two of them blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and left more than 20,000 without power on Tuesday night. But officials say there weren't any serious injuries immediately reported.\n\nThe Olympic torch is being welcomed in French port city of Marseille with fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Paris Games organizers are promising \"fantastic\" celebrations to welcome the Olympic torch in the southern city of Marseille. The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name":

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden visits Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has raced into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday traveled to Sturtevant, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center expected to create 2,000 jobs. It's the spot where then-President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy. Republicans say the Microsoft announcement is good for workers but Biden is using it to hide his record on failing to control rising inflation.\n\n3 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan, 1 man killed in Tennessee as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. National Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was shredded and more than a dozen mobile homes destroyed. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled.

The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden visits Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has raced into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday traveled to Sturtevant, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center expected to create 2,000 jobs. It's the spot where then-President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy. Republicans say the Microsoft announcement is good for workers but Biden is using it to hide his record on failing to control rising inflation.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes struck in and near a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Military officials and diplomats watched the display of firepower from a hilltop on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last year, the Philippines approved a wider U.S. military presence in the archipelago. China opposed the move, which puts U.S. forces across the sea from Taiwan. The Philippines countered it has the right to defend its sovereignty.\n\nStorms battering the Midwest bring tornadoes, hail and strong winds\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms have battered parts of the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region.

The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nMore from this section\n\nIMG Travel Protection Plans Are Now Available Through TravelInsurance.com A look at commencement ceremonies as US campuses are roiled by

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden lauds new Microsoft center on the same site where Trump's Foxconn project failed\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has laced into Donald Trump over a failed project that was supposed to bring thousands of new jobs into southeastern Wisconsin. Now on that site, construction will start on a new data center from Microsoft, whose president credits the Biden administration's economic policies. For Biden, it offers another point of contrast between him and Trump, who had promised a $10 billion investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that never came. Biden said Wednesday that \"Foxconn turned out to be just that -- a con.\" Republicans respond that Wisconsin voters have been hurt by inflation under the Democratic president's watch. Foxconn says its current Wisconsin operation \"greatly contributes\" to the company.\n\n3 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan, 1 man killed in Tennessee as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. National Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was shredded and more than a dozen mobile homes destroyed. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.\n\nMore from this section\n\nStack Sports launches Stack Rewards to Save Youth Sports Families $100M A look at commencement ceremonies as US campuses are

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael reopens key crossing for aid to enter Gaza that was closed over weekend rocket attack\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. But that limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The looming operation threatens to widen a rift between Israel and its main backer, the United States. Israel has linked the decision over launching a full-scale offensive to ongoing talks over a cease-fire and hostage release.\n\nInside the courtroom where Trump was forced to listen to Stormy Daniels\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump squirmed and scowled, shook his head and muttered as Stormy Daniels described the unexpected sex she says they had in a hotel nearly two decades ago. It was a story Daniels has told before. This time, Trump had no choice but to sit and listen. Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nGrit, humor, grief and gloom mix as Ukrainians face a dangerous new phase in the war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Grief, anger, humor, defiance and fear are some of the emotions Ukrainians are grappling with as they face a third year of war.

But most still believe Ukraine will win the war. Valentyna, who works at a power station targeted by Russian missiles, says Ukraine wants the world to remember \"that people are dying right now,\" Meanwhile, an art class for war widows helps women deal with bereavement.

Military officials and diplomats watched the display of firepower from a hilltop on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. Last year, the Philippines approved a wider U.S. military presence in the archipelago. China opposed the move, which puts U.S. forces across the sea from Taiwan. The Philippines countered it has the right to defend its sovereignty.\n\nStorms battering the Midwest bring tornadoes, hail and strong winds\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms have battered parts of the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region. Tuesday's severe weather outbreak came a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person. Forecasters warned that the storms could could spill out of the region Wednesday morning. Tornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two of them blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and left more than 20,000 without power on Tuesday night. But officials say there weren't any serious injuries immediately reported.\n\nSome colleges that had been permissive of pro-Palestinian protests begin taking a tougher stance\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Police in riot gear blocked access to the University of Chicago's Quad early Tuesday. President Paul Alivisatos acknowledged the school's role as a protector of freedom of speech but his message to the university community also took on an enough-is-enough stance. Just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities since April 18, according to figures based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Not all schools are taking such an approach. The president at Wesleyan University has commended the on-campus demonstration as an act of political expression.\n\nThe Olympic torch is being welcomed in French port city of Marseille with fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Paris Games organizers are promising \"fantastic\" celebrations to welcome the Olympic torch in the southern city of Marseille. The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name":

Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.\n\nMore from this section\n\nBoy Scouts of America changing name to more inclusive Scouting America after years of woes New Insurance Lead Generation Company Increases

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nToday's Top Headlines 1 killed in Wagener shooting; gunman not identified UPDATE: Lawyer for Aiken Mayor Milner releases statement on allegation of elder abuse 1 man dead after shooting on Aiken's Southside Aiken man accused of pointing gun at woman during parking spot dispute Warrenville woman charged after allegedly attempting to hit another person with a car Aiken Public Schools continue to discuss budget before next week's community input session Dougherty Road resurfacing project could cause traffic delays on Aiken's Southside Rotary Club of Aiken awards scholarships worth $172,500 to graduating students Mom pleads not guilty in killing of 11-month-old at Fort Eisenhower Business roundup: New Japanese restaurant opens, La Parisienne has new co-owner\n\nBiden visits Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has raced into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday traveled to Sturtevant, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center expected to create 2,000 jobs. It's the spot where then-President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy. Republicans say the Microsoft announcement is good for workers but Biden is using it to hide his record on failing to control rising inflation.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded a FedEx facility\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region. The severe weather outbreak started Tuesday and continued into Wednesday. Tornadoes were reported after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two reported tornadoes struck in and near a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported. The National Weather Service says crews are surveying storm damage in southwest Michigan but haven't confirmed tornado touchdowns in the region after the Grand Rapids office received 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and others.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com",

But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nWhy the US paused the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel ahead of a possible Rafah attack\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. has paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel over concerns that the country has not adequately taken civilian safety into account in its upcoming military operation in Rafah, and that the massive weapon would inflict additional civilian casualties. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the bombs were on hold and that a smaller diameter bomb may be a better choice to conduct limited strikes on Hamas fighters still in Rafah.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. The National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nLawyers' coalition provides new messengers for Black voter engagement\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Voting rights advocates have created a new initiative to increase Black voter turnout ahead of this fall's general election. The Young Black Lawyers' Organizing Coalition has recruited lawyers and law students from historically Black colleges and universities. They recently launched a four-state tour to engage with Black voters in Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. Their goal is to restore faith in democracy by better understanding their experiences with voter registration and ballot-box access. The coalition's law students will lead small focus groups in places like barber shops, churches, and union halls. It's an unusual role for lawyers, but the coalition is counting on their civic expertise.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.\n\nMore from this section\n\nFormer Addict

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting.

Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia.

Military officials, diplomats and reporters watched the display of firepower from a hilltop above Laoag City on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. In February last year, the Philippines approved a wider U.S. military presence in the archipelago. China opposed the move which puts US forces across the sea from Taiwan.

Tuesday's severe weather outbreak came a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person. Forecasters warned that the storms could could spill out of the region Wednesday morning. Tornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Two of them blitzed a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and left more than 20,000 without power on Tuesday night. But officials say there weren't any serious injuries immediately reported.\n\nSome colleges that had been permissive of pro-Palestinian protests begin taking a tougher stance\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Police in riot gear blocked access to the University of Chicago's Quad early Tuesday. President Paul Alivisatos acknowledged the school's role as a protector of freedom of speech but his message to the university community also took on an enough-is-enough stance. Just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities since April 18, according to figures based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Not all schools are taking such an approach. The president at Wesleyan University has commended the on-campus demonstration as an act of political expression.\n\nThe Olympic torch is being welcomed in French port city of Marseille with fanfare and high security\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Paris Games organizers are promising \"fantastic\" celebrations to welcome the Olympic torch in the southern city of Marseille. The arrival Wednesday of a majestic ship carrying the flame from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd around Marseille's Old Port, which is under high security. The flame was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem and spent 12 days at sea. Marseille's mayor said the city is proud and all efforts were made to ensure security. Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first carrier of the flame in France.\n\nFans are following Taylor Swift to Europe after finding Eras Tour tickets less costly there\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Thousands of Taylor Swift fans are following her across the pond after missing out on her U.S. concert tour last year or being put off by marked-up ticket prices. Swift is kicking off the 18-city Europe leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday. The Paris arena where she is performing says Americans bought 20% of the tickets. The Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm says about 10,000 people are coming from the U.S. for her shows. Some fans say they justified the expense after noticing that tighter restrictions on ticket fees and resales in Europe made flying overseas to see Swift no more costly and potentially cheaper than catching her closer to home.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name":

The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, according to the official, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael reopens key crossing for aid to enter Gaza that was closed over weekend rocket attack\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, a key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid.

An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing early Tuesday, and it remains closed.\n\nInside the courtroom where Trump was forced to listen to Stormy Daniels\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump squirmed and scowled, shook his head and muttered as Stormy Daniels described the unexpected sex she says they had in a hotel nearly two decades ago. It was a story Daniels has told before. This time, Trump had no choice but to sit and listen. Years in the making, the in-person showdown between the former president and the porn actor happened Tuesday in a New York courtroom that has been the stage for Trump's hush money trial. Trump denies her claims and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep quiet.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nGrit, humor, grief and gloom mix as Ukrainians face a dangerous new phase in the war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Grief, anger, humor, defiance and fear are some of the emotions Ukrainians are grappling with as they face a third year of war. Opinion researcher Anton Grushetsky says an increasing number of Ukrainians feel that \"the West is tired of Ukraine\" and allies aren't sending much-needed weapons. But most still believe Ukraine will win the war. Valentyna, who works at a power station targeted by Russian missiles, says Ukraine wants the world to remember \"that people are dying right now,\" Meanwhile, an art class for war widows helps women deal with bereavement.

Washington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea.

The floods have left at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing. Five of the city's six water treatment facilities aren't working. Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo pleaded on Tuesday with residents to comply with his water rationing decree. Melo ordered the rationing of potable water indefinitely.

The online portal already has received more than 10,000 submissions in its first week. The state auditor says none seem legitimate. Trans activists say the fake submissions are a form of peaceful protest meant to shield trans people who might be reported for possible violations.

Police broke up the nearly 2-week-old gathering on Wednesday.

National Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was shredded and more than a dozen mobile homes destroyed. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nLawyers' coalition provides new messengers for Black voter engagement\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Voting rights advocates have created a new initiative to increase Black voter turnout ahead of this fall's general election. The Young Black Lawyers' Organizing Coalition has recruited lawyers and law students from historically Black colleges and universities. They recently launched a four-state tour to engage with Black voters in Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. Their goal is to restore faith in democracy by better understanding their experiences with voter registration and ballot-box access. The coalition's law students will lead small focus groups in places like barber shops, churches, and union halls. It's an unusual role for lawyers, but the coalition is counting on their civic expertise.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nA scorching, rocky planet twice Earth's size has a thick atmosphere, scientists say\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- A thick atmosphere has been detected around a planet that's twice as big as Earth in a nearby solar system.

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden lauds new Microsoft center on the same site where Trump's Foxconn project failed\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has laced into Donald Trump over a failed project that was supposed to bring thousands of new jobs into southeastern Wisconsin. Now on that site, construction will start on a new data center from Microsoft, whose president credits the Biden administration's economic policies. For Biden, it offers another point of contrast between him and Trump, who had promised a $10 billion investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that never came. Biden said Wednesday that \"Foxconn turned out to be just that -- a con.\" Republicans respond that Wisconsin voters have been hurt by inflation under the Democratic president's watch. Foxconn says its current Wisconsin operation \"greatly contributes\" to the company.\n\n3 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan, 1 man killed in Tennessee as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. National Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was shredded and more than a dozen mobile homes destroyed. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 128 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Forecasters say that more storms are expected in the state, with lightning strikes and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph).\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nOlympic swimmer Florent Manaudou becomes first torch carrier in France as relay heads to Paris\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- French Olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou became the first Olympic torch carrier in France after the Olympic flame arrived in the southern French city of Marseille marking another milestone in the lead-up to the Summer Games in Paris. A majestic three-mast ship carried the Olympic torch from Greece for the welcoming ceremony at sunset Wednesday in the city's Old Port. The ship docked on the pontoon and Manaudou carried it to mainland France. The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Trump's defense wants to undermine the credibility of Daniels' testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys are getting another chance to question Daniels, whose account is central to prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence a presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump denies they had sex.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nNew storms pummel the South as a week of deadly weather marches on\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms has begun washing over parts of the South a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region. A heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour Thursday. Busy hub airports in Georgia and North Carolina reported delays. Tornado warnings were issued in the morning for parts of Tennessee and Alabama. The storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.\n\nMore from this section\n\nTikTok sues US to block law that could ban the social media

Police cleared the tent encampment Wednesday after dozens of protesters had left the site and marched to the university president's home. The Metropolitan Police Department says 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer. Mayor Muriel Bowser and police Chief Pamela Smith were preparing to testify about the district's handling of the protest at a House hearing Wednesday afternoon before it was canceled. Bowser says the district's response to demonstrations is \"rooted in public safety and responsibility.\"\n\nIsrael says it reopened a key Gaza crossing after a rocket attack but the UN says no aid has entered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but a United Nations agency says no aid has yet entered. The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms US has paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGeorgia appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nTrump is in no hurry as he leans into the pageantry of vice presidential tryouts\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump remains stuck in a New York courtroom listening to salacious details of an extramarital sexual encounter he denies. But another spectacle is playing out as his vice presidential tryouts get underway. The dynamic was on full display in Florida over the weekend at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club that doubled as a VP audition. Trump at one point invited many of the contenders to join him onstage and talked them up one by one. Trump is closely watching the candidates, turning his search into an \"Apprentice\"-style competition being judged on fundraising hauls, political speeches and television interviews.\n\nBiden visits Wisconsin to laud a new Microsoft facility, meet voters -- and troll Trump\n\nSTURTEVANT, Wisc. (AP) -- President Joe Biden has raced into yet another battleground state. Biden on Wednesday traveled to Sturtevant, Wisconsin, where he'll highlight a decision by Microsoft to build a $3.3 billion data center expected to create 2,000 jobs. It's the spot where then-President Donald Trump lauded a plan by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing facility that was supposed to eventually employ 10,000 people. Except it was never built. The Democratic president is continuing to push a contrast with the Republican ex-president on economic policy. Republicans say the Microsoft announcement is good for workers but Biden is using it to hide his record on failing to control rising inflation.\n\n3 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan, 1 man killed in Tennessee as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. National Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was shredded and more than a dozen mobile homes destroyed. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nMovie Review: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' finds a new hero and will blow your mind\n\nFans of the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise may still be mourning the 2017 death of Caesar, the charismatic ape leader. Not to worry: He haunts the next episode, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\" Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy calls the new movie thrilling. Screenwriter Josh Friedman has cleverly created a movie that examines how ancient stories can be hijacked and manipulated, like how Caesar's non-violent message gets twisted by bad actors. Unlike the last movie which dealt with man's inhumanity to animals -- concentration camps included -- ape-on-ape violence is in the cards for this one. The PG-13 movie hits theaters starting Friday.", "source": {"uri": "wsiltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSIL"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wsiltv.com", "name": "Associated Press",

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nNew storms pummel the South as a week of deadly weather marches on\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms has begun washing over parts of the South a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region. A heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour Thursday. Busy hub airports in Georgia and North Carolina reported delays. Tornado warnings were issued in the morning for parts of Tennessee and Alabama. The storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms.

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states.

Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative.

The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nWhy the US paused the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel ahead of a possible Rafah attack\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. has paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel over concerns that the country has not adequately taken civilian safety into account in its upcoming military operation in Rafah, and that the massive weapon would inflict additional civilian casualties. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the bombs were on hold and that a smaller diameter bomb may be a better choice to conduct limited strikes on Hamas fighters still in Rafah.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. The National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nLawyers' coalition provides new messengers for Black voter engagement\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Voting rights advocates have created a new initiative to increase Black voter turnout ahead of this fall's general election. The Young Black Lawyers' Organizing Coalition has recruited lawyers and law students from historically Black colleges and universities. They recently launched a four-state tour to engage with Black voters in Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. Their goal is to restore faith in democracy by better understanding their experiences with voter registration and ballot-box access. The coalition's law students will lead small focus groups in places like barber shops, churches, and union halls. It's an unusual role for lawyers, but the coalition is counting on their civic expertise.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton calls for justice in eulogy for Ohio man who died last month in police custody\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and family members of an Ohio man who died in police custody last month told mourners at his funeral that they and the community must fight to see that he gets justice. Sharpton gave the eulogy for Frank Tyson during the funeral Wednesday in Canton. The 53-year-old East Canton resident died April 18 after he resisted while being handcuffed and was left facedown on the floor of a social club. Police restrained Tyson -- including with a knee on his back -- and he immediately told officers he could not breathe.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

The past three days, streams of people fleeing the city with belongings have jammed roads leading out, on foot and in cars, trucks and donkey carts in a confused evacuation while continued Israeli bombardment boomed and raised palls of smoke.

Donald Trump, his leader of the Republican National Committee and other Republicans have warned Greene off the effort. But Greene, who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, wants to rebuke Johnson after passage of a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine as it fights Russia. Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York have said they would vote to table Greene's effort, essentially saving Johnson's job, for now.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. The National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton calls for justice in eulogy for Ohio man who died last month in police custody\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and family members of an Ohio man who died in police custody last month told mourners at his funeral that they and the community must fight to see that he gets justice. Sharpton gave the eulogy for Frank Tyson during the funeral Wednesday in Canton. The 53-year-old East Canton resident died April 18 after he resisted while being handcuffed and was left facedown on the floor of a social club. Police restrained Tyson -- including with a knee on his back -- and he immediately told officers he could not breathe.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.\n\nMore from this section\n\nIMG Travel Protection

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nNew storms pummel the South as a week of deadly weather marches on\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms has begun washing over parts of the South a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region. A heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour Thursday. Busy hub airports in Georgia and North Carolina reported delays. Tornado warnings were issued in the morning for parts of Tennessee and Alabama. The storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. The past three days, streams of people fleeing the city with belongings have jammed roads leading out, on foot and in cars, trucks and donkey carts in a confused evacuation while continued Israeli bombardment boomed and raised palls of smoke. With supplies cut off, humanitarian workers were running out of fuel and scrambling to help a population once again pushed into motion.\n\nHouse quickly rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has called for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers have quickly rejected it. Greene of Georgia pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels who are tired of the political chaos. Donald Trump, his leader of the Republican National Committee and other Republicans have warned Greene off the effort. But Greene, who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, wants to rebuke Johnson after the passage of a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine as it fights Russia. Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York had said they would vote to table Greene's effort, essentially saving Johnson's job, for now.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto his vehicle. The National Weather Service says tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were also confirmed in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Arkansas early Wednesday.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton calls for justice in eulogy for Ohio man who died last month in police custody\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and family members of an Ohio man who died in police custody last month told mourners at his funeral that they and the community must fight to see that he gets justice. Sharpton gave the eulogy for Frank Tyson during the funeral Wednesday in Canton. The 53-year-old East Canton resident died April 18 after he resisted while being handcuffed and was left facedown on the floor of a social club. Police restrained Tyson -- including with a knee on his back -- and he immediately told officers he could not breathe.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Trump's defense wants to undermine the credibility of Daniels' testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys get another chance Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence a presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. The Republican looked on in the courtroom Tuesday as Daniels described a sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they had sex.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nStorms threaten the South as a week of deadly weather punches through the US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Forecasters are warning a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South. Thursday's forecast comes a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed three people in Tennessee and North Carolina. The storms continue a streak of torrential rain and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and now the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. More than a quarter-million customers lack power across several states. Thunderstorms with torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.\n\nMore from this section\n\nNew Insurance Lead Generation Company Increases Online Visibility for Niche Insurance Agencies and Carriers How to Convert Spotify Music to MP3 320 Kbps with YT Saver?

President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to go ahead with such an operation over fears it would exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian enclave. On Wednesday, he said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for a Rafah offensive, raising pressure on Netanyahu. But in a statement released Thursday, Netanyahu said \"if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTrump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorney accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Attorney Susan Necheles is trying to persuade the jury in Trump's hush money trial that the key prosecution witness cannot be believed. But Trump's case doesn't rise or fall on Daniels' account. It's a trial about money changing hands in business transactions and whether those hush money payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country.

(AP) -- The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle say they want to correct a false narrative put forth by authorities about his death. The family of Senior Airmen Roger Fortson planned to view body camera video later in the day. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing the family. He says Fortson did not know it was sheriff's deputies who were breaking into his apartment and that he grabbed his \"legally owned firearm\" to protect himself. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office planned to hold a news conference later Thursday afternoon.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda.

Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nMore from this section\n\nTrump fined $1,000 for gag order violation in hush money case as ex-employee recounts reimbursements IMG Travel Protection

Trump's defense wants to undermine the credibility of Daniels' testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys are getting another chance to question Daniels, whose account is central to prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence a presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump denies they had sex.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nStorms threaten the South as a week of deadly weather punches through the US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Forecasters are warning a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South. Thursday's forecast comes a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed three people in Tennessee and North Carolina. The storms continue a streak of torrential rain and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and now the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. More than a quarter-million customers lack power across several states. Thunderstorms with torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to go ahead with such an operation over fears it would exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian enclave. On Wednesday, he said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for a Rafah offensive, raising pressure on Netanyahu. But in a statement released Thursday, Netanyahu said \"if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTrump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorney accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Attorney Susan Necheles is trying to persuade the jury in Trump's hush money trial that the key prosecution witness cannot be believed. But Trump's case doesn't rise or fall on Daniels' account. It's a trial about money changing hands in business transactions and whether those hush money payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nVideo shows Florida deputy announced himself prior to fatal shooting of Black airman\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Body camera video shows a Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle. Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden disputed assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself. Crump noted that the officer did not tell Roger to drop his gun before shooting.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul did not consent to California's extradition request during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York, with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nTechnology crushing human creativity? Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. The past three days, streams of people fleeing the city with belongings have jammed roads leading out, on foot and in cars, trucks and donkey carts in a confused evacuation while continued Israeli bombardment boomed and raised palls of smoke. With supplies cut off, humanitarian workers were running out of fuel and scrambling to help a population once again pushed into motion.\n\nHouse quickly rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has called for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers have quickly rejected it. Greene of Georgia pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels who are tired of the political chaos. Donald Trump, his leader of the Republican National Committee and other Republicans have warned Greene off the effort. But Greene, who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, wants to rebuke Johnson after the passage of a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine as it fights Russia. Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York had said they would vote to table Greene's effort, essentially saving Johnson's job, for now.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in. The National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton calls for justice in eulogy for Ohio man who died last month in police custody\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and family members of an Ohio man who died in police custody last month told mourners at his funeral that they and the community must fight to see that he gets justice. Sharpton gave the eulogy for Frank Tyson during the funeral Wednesday in Canton. The 53-year-old East Canton resident died April 18 after he resisted while being handcuffed and was left facedown on the floor of a social club. Police restrained Tyson -- including with a knee on his back -- and he immediately told officers he could not breathe.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was home alone when they saw he was armed with a gun. Air Force officials say Senior Airman Roger Fortson died Friday at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Attorney Ben Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. The past three days, streams of people fleeing the city with belongings have jammed roads leading out, on foot and in cars, trucks and donkey carts in a confused evacuation while continued Israeli bombardment boomed and raised palls of smoke. With supplies cut off, humanitarian workers were running out of fuel and scrambling to help a population once again pushed into motion.\n\nHouse quickly rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has called for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers have quickly rejected it. Greene of Georgia pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels who are tired of the political chaos. Donald Trump, his leader of the Republican National Committee and other Republicans have warned Greene off the effort. But Greene, who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, wants to rebuke Johnson after the passage of a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine as it fights Russia. Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York had said they would vote to table Greene's effort, essentially saving Johnson's job, for now.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross central US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S., killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto his vehicle. The National Weather Service says tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Tornadoes were also confirmed in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Arkansas early Wednesday.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani, will plead guilty in betting case\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case. Prosecutors alleged Ippei Mizuhara stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts. Mizuhara's scheduled arraignment Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles was postponed earlier Tuesday. The scandal shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara was initially charged with one count of bank fraud. Authorities say there was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to go ahead with such an operation over fears it would exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian enclave. On Wednesday, he said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for a Rafah offensive, raising pressure on Netanyahu. But in a statement released Thursday, Netanyahu said \"if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTrump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorney accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Attorney Susan Necheles is trying to persuade the jury in Trump's hush money trial that the key prosecution witness cannot be believed. But Trump's case doesn't rise or fall on Daniels' account. It's a trial about money changing hands in business transactions and whether those hush money payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nVideo shows Florida deputy announced himself prior to fatal shooting of Black airman\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Police body camera video shows a Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman in his apartment. Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden showed police body camera video of the May 3 shooting at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Earlier, the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys said they wanted to clear his name and disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. The video shows Fortson had a gun that was pointed downward. Noted civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing Fortson's family. He says the gun as legally registered and that the Constitution gave Fortson the right to own it and against unreasonable searches by police.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nTechnology crushing human creativity? Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDataNumen Unveils DataNumen Data Recovery 3.0: Multilingual Magic and More!

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels will return to the witness stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial, as the defense tries to undermine the credibility of the porn actor's salacious testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys will get another chance on Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to the prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence the 2016 presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump looked on in the courtroom as Daniels for hours on Tuesday described an unexpected sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they ever had sex.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nPowerful storms kill 3 as tornadoes tear through central and southeastern US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the central and southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says at least eight tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says that the three confirmed tornadoes there had touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Army General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, said his team is working at full steam before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman. Attorney Ben Crump says Senior Airman Roger Fortson was home alone Friday when deputies saw he was armed with a gun. Fortson died after the shooting at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFirst shipment of aid to the US-built floating pier in Gaza departs from Cyprus\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Cyprus' foreign minister says a shipment of humanitarian aid has left a port in Cyprus and is on its way to the U.S-built pier in Gaza, the first delivery to the newly built ramp. The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he won't supply offensive weapons Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden acknowledges \"civilians have been killed in Gaza\" by the type of heavy bombs the U.S. has been supplying. Biden said in an interview Wednesday with CNN the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But the Democratic president says if Israel goes into Rafah, the U.S. is \"not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\"\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nToday's Top Headlines UPDATE: Lawyer for Aiken Mayor Milner releases statement on allegation of elder abuse 'A dream come true:' Research project focuses on cemetery Aiken Scholars Academy receives high national rankings from U.S. News and World Report 1 man dead after shooting on Aiken's Southside Suspect arrested in fatal Wagener shooting; victim identified Great Oak Equine Assisted Programs holds spring horse show 1 killed in Wagener shooting; gunman not identified Dougherty Road resurfacing project could cause traffic delays on Aiken's Southside Aiken High Students in activism club discuss transformative California field trip experience Aiken Public Schools continue to discuss budget before next week's community input session\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nNew storms pummel the South as a week of deadly weather marches on\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms has begun washing over parts of the South a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region. A heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour Thursday. Busy hub airports in Georgia and North Carolina reported delays. Tornado warnings were issued in the morning for parts of Tennessee and Alabama. The storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman. Attorney Ben Crump says Senior Airman Roger Fortson was home alone Friday when deputies saw he was armed with a gun. Fortson died after the shooting at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. Her long-shot effort was swiftly and resoundingly rejected Wednesday by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. Johnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nPowerful storms kill 2 as tornadoes tear through central and southeastern US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Severe storms have torn through the central and southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says at least eight tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says that the three confirmed tornadoes there had touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

The key terminal for the entry of humanitarian aid was closed over the weekend after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. An Israeli tank brigade seized the nearby Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt early Tuesday, and it remained closed. The limited incursion does not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of the crowded southern city that Israel has repeatedly promised. The U.S. has urged Israel not to launch a full-on assault on Rafah because it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, and it paused a shipment of bombs to its close ally last week over those concerns.\n\nPentagon chief confirms U.S. has paused bomb shipment to Israel\n\nWASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has confirmed the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns the country was approaching a decision to launch a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S. Confirmed Wednesday, the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nGa. court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on Trump election case\n\nATLANTA -- An attorney for Donald Trump says the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to a Georgia appeals court that will review a ruling letting Fani Willis keep prosecuting the election interference case against him. The Republican ex-president and some other defendants had tried to get the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. The judge overseeing the case ruled Willis could continue if Wade stepped aside, which Wade did. The judge allowed Trump and the others to seek a review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday agreed to take the case. Willis hasn't commented.\n\nToday's Top Headlines 1 killed in Wagener shooting; gunman not identified UPDATE: Lawyer for Aiken Mayor Milner releases statement on allegation of elder abuse 1 man dead after shooting on Aiken's Southside Aiken man accused of pointing gun at woman during parking spot dispute Warrenville woman charged after allegedly attempting to hit another person with a car Aiken Public Schools continue to discuss budget before next week's community input session Dougherty Road resurfacing project could cause traffic delays on Aiken's Southside Rotary Club of Aiken awards scholarships worth $172,500 to graduating students Mom pleads not guilty in killing of 11-month-old at Fort Eisenhower Business roundup: New Japanese restaurant opens, La Parisienne has new co-owner TikTok sues U.S. to block law that could ban the social media platform\n\nTikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, are suing the U.S. government over a law that would ban the popular video-sharing app unless it's sold to an approved buyer. The lawsuit filed Tuesday might set up what could be a protracted legal fight over its future in the United States. The companies argue that the new law vaguely paints ByteDance's ownership of TikTok as a national security threat in order to circumvent the First Amendment, despite no evidence that the company poses a threat. It also says the law is so \"obviously unconstitutional\" that its sponsors are instead portraying it as a way to regulate TikTok's ownership.\n\nSevere storms batter the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- Severe storms are battering parts of the Midwest with heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes that forecasters warn could spill out of the region.

Two reported tornadoes struck in and near a Michigan city near Kalamazoo and shredded a FedEx facility. Officials say no serious injuries were immediately reported.

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Latest | Testimony in Trump's hush money trial forges ahead with more witnesses\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels has concluded her testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial after hours of questioning over two days. Daniels detailed, among other things, her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump and the money she was paid to keep quiet about it. The defense responded by attacking Daniels' credibility, accusing her Thursday of changing her story over the years and trying to extort the former president. Prosecutors say Trump and others schemed to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories that might hurt his campaign. He is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments by logging them as legal expenses. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIsraeli military says it has weapons it needs for Rafah ground operation\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's military spokesman says the army has the weapons it needs to press ahead with its offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari was asked at a news conference Thursday whether the army can conduct the operation without U.S. arms. \"The army has armaments for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah too -- we have what we need,\" Hagari said. Hagari spoke after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah. Hagari says relations with the U.S. remain close, and that disagreements should be resolved behind closed doors.\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case, or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, left the Larnaca port on Thursday morning. The voyage comes about two months after President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops have ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he will not supply offensive weapons that Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Porn actor Stormy Daniels is returning to the witness stand in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial. Trump's defense wants to undermine the credibility of Daniels' testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys get another chance Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence a presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. The Republican looked on in the courtroom Tuesday as Daniels described a sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they had sex.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nStorms threaten the South as a week of deadly weather punches through the US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Forecasters are warning a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South. Thursday's forecast comes a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed three people in Tennessee and North Carolina. The storms continue a streak of torrential rain and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and now the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. More than a quarter-million customers lack power across several states. Thunderstorms with torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nRussia celebrates victory in World War II as Putin accuses the West of fueling global conflicts\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wrapped itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II by hailing his forces in Ukraine and blasting the West for fueling conflicts around the world. Putin has turned the holiday into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few World War II veterans are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important symbol of the country's prowess. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI.

The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, departed from the Larnaca port with the aim of transferring as much aid to Gaza as possible through the maritime corridor. The trip comes some two months after U.S. President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast.

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels will return to the witness stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial, as the defense tries to undermine the credibility of the porn actor's salacious testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys will get another chance on Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to the prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence the 2016 presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump looked on in the courtroom as Daniels for hours on Tuesday described an unexpected sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they ever had sex.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nPowerful storms kill 3 as tornadoes tear through central and southeastern US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the central and southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says at least eight tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says that the three confirmed tornadoes there had touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Army General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, said his team is working at full steam before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nMore from this section\n\nNew Insurance Lead

One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nTornadoes tear through southeastern US as storms leave 3 dead\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Forecasters warn that the wave of storms could march toward parts of the South early Thursday. The storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that have cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. Officials say at least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nRussia's celebration of victory in World War II is a key pillar of Putin's rule\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is wrapping itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, a celebration of its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II that President Vladimir Putin has turned into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine. Even though few veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTorchbearers in Marseille kick off the Olympic flame's journey across France\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Torchbearers are carrying the Olympic flame through the streets of France's southern port city of Marseille a day after it arrived on a majestic three-mast ship. The torch began its 11-week journey across the country with about 10,000 bearers passing through more than 450 towns until the Games' opening ceremony in Paris on July 26. Former soccer player Basile Boli, who played with the Marseille team in the 1990s, kicked off Thursday's relay from the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica. Basketball player Tony Parker also took his turn in the relay. One of the torchbearers is Ukrainian gymnast Mariia Vysochanska. It's an expression of solidarity with Ukraine as well as a symbolic gesture marking Europe Day,\n\nMore from this section\n\nStack Sports launches Stack Rewards to Save Youth Sports Families $100M

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman. Attorney Ben Crump says Senior Airman Roger Fortson was home alone Friday when deputies saw he was armed with a gun. Fortson died after the shooting at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. Her long-shot effort was swiftly and resoundingly rejected Wednesday by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. Johnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nPowerful storms kill 3 as tornadoes tear through central and southeastern US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the central and southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says at least eight tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says that the three confirmed tornadoes there had touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nWhy the US paused the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel ahead of a possible Rafah attack\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. has paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel over concerns that the country has not adequately taken civilian safety into account in its upcoming military operation in Rafah, and that the massive weapon would inflict additional civilian casualties. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the bombs were on hold and that a smaller diameter bomb may be a better choice to conduct limited strikes on Hamas fighters still in Rafah.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman. Attorney Ben Crump says Senior Airman Roger Fortson was home alone Friday when deputies saw he was armed with a gun. Fortson died after the shooting at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse quickly rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called for the vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers have quickly rejected it. Greene of Georgia pressed ahead Wednesday with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels who are tired of the political chaos. Donald Trump, his leader of the Republican National Committee and other Republicans have warned Greene off the effort. But Greene, who is one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, wants to rebuke Johnson after the passage of a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine as it fights Russia. Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York had said they would vote to table Greene's effort, essentially saving Johnson's job, for now.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\n8 tornadoes confirmed in Ohio, 3 in Michigan as severe storms cross US\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three were confirmed in Michigan as severe storms continued barreling through the central and southeastern U.S., killing one person in Tennessee and one in North Carolina when trees fell on their vehicles. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says Wednesday that the tornadoes there touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nRape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized\n\nMEULABOH, Indonesia (AP) -- In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat that was carrying Rohingya refugees when it capsized off Indonesia. The U.N. says another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed. The Associated Press has interviewed eight surviving passengers who provided the first insights into what happened on board and why the boat capsized. They say the Indonesian captain and crew sexually assaulted four women and girls and grew angry when others refused to join the captain in his bedroom. Passengers say the captain then deliberately capsized the boat before fleeing with three crew members. Police say murder charges aren't being considered. They've charged four people with people smuggling but haven't found the captain.\n\nDogs entering US must be 6 months old and microchipped to prevent spread of rabies, new rules say\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New U.S. rules require all dogs coming into the U.S. to be at least 6 months old and microchipped to help prevent the spread of rabies. The new rules published Wednesday require vaccination for dogs that have been in countries where rabies is common. The regulations apply to dogs brought in by breeders or rescue groups as well as pets traveling with their U.S. owners. Worries about rabies resulted in a temporary order in 2021, suspending the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries. The new rules take effect on Aug. 1, as the temporary order expires.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

Netanyahu spoke after President Joe Biden said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for Israel's long-promised assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel says that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza and Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to invade the city, despite widespread international opposition due concerns over the more than 1 million Palestinian civilians are huddled in the city. \"If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" said. \"If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering.

Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Latest | Testimony in Trump's hush money trial forges ahead with more witnesses\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels has concluded her testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial after hours of questioning over two days. Daniels detailed, among other things, her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump and the money she was paid to keep quiet about it. The defense responded by attacking Daniels' credibility, accusing her Thursday of changing her story over the years and trying to extort the former president. Prosecutors say Trump and others schemed to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories that might hurt his campaign. He is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments by logging them as legal expenses. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nAttorney, family of Black airman fatally shot by Florida deputies say he was a patriot\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle say they want to correct a false narrative put forth by authorities about his death. The family of Senior Airmen Roger Fortson planned to view body camera video later in the day. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing the family. He says Fortson did not know it was sheriff's deputies who were breaking into his apartment and that he grabbed his \"legally owned firearm\" to protect himself. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office planned to hold a news conference later Thursday afternoon.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case, or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nTechnology crushing human creativity? Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name":

The U.S. vessel, loaded with much needed humanitarian assistance, departed from the Larnaca port with the aim of transferring as much aid to Gaza as possible through the maritime corridor. The trip comes some two months after U.S. President Joe Biden gave the order to build the large floating platform several miles off the Gaza coast. The relief is desperately needed, with the United Nations saying people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and as Israeli troops ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBiden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he will not supply offensive weapons that Israel can use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there. Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Porn actor Stormy Daniels is returning to the witness stand in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial. Trump's defense wants to undermine the credibility of Daniels' testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys get another chance Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence a presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. The Republican looked on in the courtroom Tuesday as Daniels described a sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they had sex.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nTornadoes tear through southeastern US as storms leave 3 dead\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Forecasters warn that the wave of storms could march toward parts of the South early Thursday. The storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that have cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. Officials say at least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country.

Even though few veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTorchbearers in Marseille kick off the Olympic flame's journey across France\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Torchbearers are carrying the Olympic flame through the streets of France's southern port city of Marseille a day after it arrived on a majestic three-mast ship. The torch began its 11-week journey across the country with about 10,000 bearers passing through more than 450 towns until the Games' opening ceremony in Paris on July 26. Former soccer player Basile Boli, who played with the Marseille team in the 1990s, kicked off Thursday's relay from the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica. Basketball player Tony Parker also took his turn in the relay. One of the torchbearers is Ukrainian gymnast Mariia Vysochanska. It's an expression of solidarity with Ukraine as well as a symbolic gesture marking Europe Day,", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors":

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nThe Latest | Rafah's hospitals will run out of fuel in 3 days, WHO says\n\nThe U.N. World Health Organization says it has only three days of fuel for its medical operations in southern Gaza, and shortages have already forced one of three hospitals in the city of Rafah to shut down. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt has been closed since Israel's military took control of the Palestinian side early Tuesday, blocking the entry of vital humanitarian aid. Israel said it reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing, the other main aid entry point, on Wednesday. However, the U.N. World Food Program says no aid has entered, and there is no one to receive it on the Palestinian side. The U.N. says northern Gaza is already in a state of \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels will return to the witness stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial, as the defense tries to undermine the credibility of the porn actor's salacious testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys will get another chance on Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to the prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence the 2016 presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump looked on in the courtroom as Daniels for hours on Tuesday described an unexpected sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they ever had sex.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nTornadoes tear through southeastern US as storms leave 3 dead\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Forecasters warn that the wave of storms could march toward parts of the South early Thursday. The storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that have cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. Officials say at least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Army General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, said his team is working at full steam before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.\n\nRussia's celebration of victory in World War II is a key pillar of Putin's rule\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is wrapping itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, a celebration of its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II that President Vladimir Putin has turned into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his move into Ukraine. Even though few veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nVatican and Rome enter final dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull and around-the-clock construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican is crossing a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis will preside over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of pilgrims visiting the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of public funds to carry out long-delayed public works projects.\n\nTorchbearers in Marseille kick off the Olympic flame's journey across France\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Torchbearers are carrying the Olympic flame through the streets of France's southern port city of Marseille a day after it arrived on a majestic three-mast ship. The torch began its 11-week journey across the country with about 10,000 bearers passing through more than 450 towns until the Games' opening ceremony in Paris on July 26. Former soccer player Basile Boli, who played with the Marseille team in the 1990s, kicked off Thursday's relay from the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica. Basketball player Tony Parker also took his turn in the relay. One of the torchbearers is Ukrainian gymnast Mariia Vysochanska. It's an expression of solidarity with Ukraine as well as a symbolic gesture marking Europe Day,", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

Netanyahu spoke after President Joe Biden said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for Israel's long-promised assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel says that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza and Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to invade the city, despite widespread international opposition due concerns over the more than 1 million Palestinian civilians are huddled in the city. \"If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" said. \"If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTrump attorney and Stormy Daniels trade barbs during questions about alleged 2006 sexual encounter\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorney accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Attorney Susan Necheles is trying to persuade the jury in Trump's hush money trial that the key prosecution witness cannot be believed. But Trump's case doesn't rise or fall on Daniels' account. It's a trial about money changing hands in business transactions and whether those hush money payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep.

That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nAttorney, family of Black airman fatally shot by Florida deputies say he was a patriot\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle say they want to correct a false narrative put forth by authorities about his death. The family of Senior Airmen Roger Fortson planned to view body camera video later in the day. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing the family. He says Fortson did not know it was sheriff's deputies who were breaking into his apartment and that he grabbed his \"legally owned firearm\" to protect himself.

The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nTechnology crushing human creativity? Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash.

Netanyahu spoke after President Joe Biden said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for Israel's long-promised assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel says that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza and Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to invade the city, despite widespread international opposition due concerns over the more than 1 million Palestinian civilians are huddled in the city. \"If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" said. \"If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails.\"\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. is warning that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries through with plans for an all-out assault on Rafah. The city is the last major militant stronghold in Gaza. The warning was backed by a fresh threat from President Joe Biden. He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering. The U.S. is making its sharpest moves yet to influence the decision-making of its ally in the ongoing war on the militant group triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nStormy Daniels spars with Trump defense attorney in tense exchange over cash-for-silence transaction\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorneys are grilling Stormy Daniels on the transaction at the center of the former president's hush money trial. The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate.

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nDefense attacks Stormy Daniels' credibility as she returns to the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels will return to the witness stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial, as the defense tries to undermine the credibility of the porn actor's salacious testimony about an alleged sexual encounter and the money she got to keep quiet. Defense attorneys will get another chance on Thursday to question Daniels, whose account is central to the prosecutors' case accusing Trump of scheming to illegally influence the 2016 presidential campaign by burying unflattering stories. Trump looked on in the courtroom as Daniels for hours on Tuesday described an unexpected sexual encounter she says they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump denies they ever had sex.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker, and Trump said at some point there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nTornadoes tear through southeastern US as storms leave 3 dead\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Forecasters warn that the wave of storms could march toward parts of the South early Thursday. The storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that have cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. Officials say at least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Army General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, said his team is working at full steam before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.\n\nRussia's celebration of victory in World War II is a key pillar of Putin's rule\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is wrapping itself in patriotic pageantry for Victory Day, a celebration of its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II that President Vladimir Putin has turned into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his move into Ukraine. Even though few veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War are still alive 79 years after Berlin fell to the Red Army, the victory over Nazi Germany remains the most important and widely revered symbol of the country's prowess and a key element of national identity. The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in the war, an estimate that many historians consider conservative. Thursday's festivities honor that sacrifice.\n\nCivilian casualties rise in Myanmar's civil war as resistance forces tighten noose around military\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Six months into an offensive against Myanmar's military government, opposition forces have made massive gains, but civilian casualties are rising sharply as regime troops increasingly turn toward scorched-earth tactics in the Southeast Asian country's bitter civil war. There is pressure on all fronts from powerful militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and newer resistance forces. Troops are retaliating with air, naval and artillery strikes on hospitals and other facilities where the opposition could be sheltered or aided. About 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the start of the offensive and more than 1,000 civilians have been killed.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nTorchbearers in Marseille kick off the Olympic flame's journey across the country\n\nMARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Torchbearers are to carry the Olympic flame through the streets of France' s southern port city of Marseille, one day after it arrived on a majestic three-mast ship for the welcoming ceremony. The torch begins its 11-week journey across the country Thursday. About 10,000 bearers will pass through more than 450 towns until the Games' opening ceremony in Paris on July 26. Participants were scheduled to run all day through the most emblematic places of the city to finally bring the torch on the roof of the famed Stade Velodrome, home to Marseille's passionate soccer fans. The city celebrated with great fanfare the flame's arrival Wednesday with a large crowd in the Old Port.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Latest | Testimony in Trump's hush money trial forges ahead with more witnesses\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels has concluded her testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial after hours of questioning. Daniels spent hours Tuesday detailing for jurors their alleged sexual encounter and the money she was paid to keep quiet about it. The defense in response attacked Daniels' credibility, accusing her of rehearsing her testimony and trying to extort the former president. The trial resumed Thursday. Prosecutors say Trump and others schemed to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories that might hurt his campaign. He is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments by logging them as legal expenses. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nShip loaded with aid heads for US-built Gaza pier, but it's unclear when or how it will be delivered\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The first aid ship bound for an American-built floating pier to be installed in Gaza has departed. But it's unclear when the corridor will be up and running, and humanitarian groups say there are still major obstacles to getting food to starving Palestinians in the war-ravaged enclave. Cyprus announced the ship's departure Thursday even though the U.S. military has not yet installed the pier and questions remain as to how the aid will be distributed. Even when the route is up and running, it won't be able to handle as much aid as Gaza's two main land crossings, which are currently inaccessible. The U.N. says most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians suffer from hunger and that northern Gaza is already experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard-line Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. But the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not end the political chaos. Greene is among Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress and stood on the House floor Wednesday to read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest. Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority kept Johnson in his job. But any lawmaker can try to remove the speaker. And Trump says there \"may very well be\" another bid to do so.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case, or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing.

He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes.

Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

Biden, in an interview Wednesday with CNN, says the U.S. is still committed to Israel's defense and will supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms. But he says that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.\" The interview marked Biden's toughest public comments yet about the potential Israeli military operation and followed his decision to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel last week.\n\nPalestinians flee chaos and panic in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Gaza's overcrowded southernmost city, Rafah, has been thrown into panic and chaos by Israel's seizure of the nearby border crossing with Egypt and as the possibility of a full-scale invasion looms. Tens of thousands of displaced and exhausted Palestinians have packed up their tents and other belongings, dragging families on a new exodus. The main hospital has shut down, leaving little care for people suffering from malnutrition, illnesses and wounds. And with fuel and other supplies cut off, aid workers have been scrambling to help a population desperate after seven months of war.\n\nFlorida deputies who fatally shot US airman burst into wrong apartment, attorney says\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- A civil rights attorney says deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman. Attorney Ben Crump says Senior Airman Roger Fortson was home alone Friday when deputies saw he was armed with a gun. Fortson died after the shooting at his off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office says a deputy responding to a disturbance call fired in self-defense after encountering an armed man. Crump said Wednesday that a woman who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the encounter believes deputies must have entered the wrong apartment.\n\nBiden administration will propose tougher asylum standards for some migrants at the border\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration plans to propose a new rule Thursday aimed at speeding up the asylum claims process for some migrants. It could come before President Joe Biden enacts a bigger crackdown at the border later this year. The proposal, which will be released Thursday, is meant to impact migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States. That's according to four people who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the plans. However, immigration advocates have previously raised questions about any changes to this part of the asylum process.\n\nHouse rejects Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from office\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried and failed to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. Her long-shot effort was swiftly and resoundingly rejected Wednesday by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos. One of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest, and Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling for a vote to table Greene's motion. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. Johnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nSouthern Brazil is still reeling from massive flooding as it faces risk from new storms\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in southern Brazil are rushing to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents are refusing to leave belongings behind while others are returning to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms. Authorities say the heavy rains and flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters. Army General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, said his team is working at full steam before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.\n\nPowerful storms kill 3 as tornadoes tear through central and southeastern US\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Severe storms are tearing through the central and southeast U.S., spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and another in North Carolina. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency was issued for an area south of Nashville. That is the National Weather Service's highest alert level. The weather service says at least eight tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in the state's southwest region. Weather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal says that the three confirmed tornadoes there had touched down in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nTransitional council in Haiti embraces new changes following turmoil as gang violence grips country\n\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A transitional council tasked with choosing new leaders for Haiti is changing the way it operates in a move that is surprising many as gang violence consumes the country. Two members who were not authorized to publicly share the changes because they had not yet been announced told The Associated Press late Wednesday that instead of a single council president, four politicians will take turns leading the council every five months. The members said the council also will now consider five members a majority, instead of four. The council is composed of nine members, seven of which have voting powers.\n\nPolice clear pro-Palestinian protest camp and arrest 33 at DC campus as mayor's hearing is canceled\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are welcoming a police crackdown that cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and led to the arrests of 33 protesters. But one of the students arrested in Washington, Moataz Salim, says authorities merely \"destroyed a beautiful community space that was all about love.\" Police broke up the gathering Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson said it should not have required \"threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress\" for police to end the protest. Mayor Muriel Bowser says city officials acted because the situation was becoming more volatile. She was to testify to a House panel about her handling of the protest but the hearing was canceled after the crackdown.\n\nJokic wins NBA's MVP award, his 3rd in 4 seasons. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the NBA MVP trophy is his again. The Denver Nuggets star from Serbia was announced Wednesday night as the league's Most Valuable Player. It's his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished. Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category, but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

The defense pressed Daniels on Thursday about why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. Daniels avoided eye contact with the former president as she walked into the Manhattan courtroom and made her way to the witness stand for a second day of testimony. Prosecutors argue that Trump and his allies snatched up potentially damaging stories and buried them in an illegal effort to influence the November results. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Latest | Testimony in Trump's hush money trial forges ahead with more witnesses\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stormy Daniels has concluded her testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial after hours of questioning over two days. Daniels detailed, among other things, her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump and the money she was paid to keep quiet about it. The defense responded by attacking Daniels' credibility, accusing her Thursday of changing her story over the years and trying to extort the former president. Prosecutors say Trump and others schemed to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories that might hurt his campaign. He is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments by logging them as legal expenses. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIsraeli military says it has weapons it needs for Rafah ground operation\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's military spokesman says the army has the weapons it needs to press ahead with its offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari was asked at a news conference Thursday whether the army can conduct the operation without U.S. arms. \"The army has armaments for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah too -- we have what we need,\" Hagari said. Hagari spoke after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah. Hagari says relations with the U.S. remain close, and that disagreements should be resolved behind closed doors.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job. But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Republican a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they may not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him. The episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating.\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country. That's according to an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown. The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases. The findings are in a report provided to The Associated Press that analyzed FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states. The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A research group that's trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda. Suggestions include making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia and banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government property. The book was shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday. It's the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. The group says it is independent from Trump's campaign. The campaign insists that the only Trump-backed policies are ones he articulates himself.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case, or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence. The fallen movie mogul denied consent for the extradition request from California during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York with the next appearance set for Aug. 7. Weinstein was released from a city hospital days ago. He showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nHoly Year or holy mess, Vatican and Rome begin dash to 2025 Jubilee with papal bull, construction\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican has crossed a key milestone in the runup to its 2025 Jubilee with the promulgation of the official decree establishing the Holy Year. Pope Francis is presiding over a ceremony Thursday in St. Peter's Basilica for the formal reading of the papal bull. The event also kicks off the final seven-month dash of preparations and public works projects to be completed by Dec. 24, when Francis opens the basilica's Holy Door and formally inaugurates the Jubilee. In the papal bull, Francis announces that he will also open a Holy Door in a prison, to give prisoners a sense of hope.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. \"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California and in the Army and an appearance as bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game.\" It reflects on his small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and fame as Thomas Magnum, a Vietnam war veteran-turned detective who zipped around Hawaii in a red Ferrari, lived in luxury and solved crimes. The show aired from 1980-1988. Selleck now stars in \"Blue Bloods\" on CBS.\n\nTikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal\n\nTikTok says it's going to start automatically labeling content that's made by artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms. TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform. TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

Attorney Susan Necheles is trying to persuade the jury in Trump's hush money trial that the key prosecution witness cannot be believed. But Trump's case doesn't rise or fall on Daniels' account. It's a trial about money changing hands in business transactions and whether those hush money payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records.\n\nTrump is limited in what he can say about his court case. His GOP allies are showing up to help\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is limited in what he can publicly say as his hush money trial is underway in New York. But he's getting help from some GOP allies who are joining him in court. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida was the latest surrogate to accompany Trump. Last week, it was Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who joined the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. The Republicans' courtroom presence can help Trump connect with constituents while he's stuck in court and feeling the pressure of a gag order placed on him by the judge.\n\nNetanyahu on US threat to withhold arms: Israel will fight with its 'fingernails' if needed\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a U.S. threat to withhold some arms would not prevent Israel from continuing its offensive in Gaza, indicating it might proceed with an invasion of the packed city of Rafah against the wishes of its closest ally. President Joe Biden has urged Israel not to go ahead with such an operation over fears it would exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian enclave. On Wednesday, he said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for a Rafah offensive, raising pressure on Netanyahu. But in a statement released Thursday, Netanyahu said \"if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.\"\n\nThe Biden-Netanyahu relationship is strained like never before. Can the two leaders move forward?\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have long managed a complicated relationship. But now they find themselves running out of space to maneuver as their interests diverge and their political futures hang in the balance. Their ties have hit a low point this week: Biden confirmed he ordered the suspension of delivery of heavy bombs to Israel as Netanyahu resists White House pressure to scrap plans to move forward with a widescale operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Netanyahu has grown increasingly resistant to Biden's public charm offensives and private pleading, prompting the president's more assertive pushback in the past several weeks.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate.

(AP) -- Body camera video shows a Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle. Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden disputed assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself. Crump noted that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting.\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence.

Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with experts noting that the campaign's execution missed the mark, showing instruments and tools cherished by many being mercilessly crushed by technology.\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash.

Some decisions were made that weren't approved by everyone,\" Bredau said after the race, leading many to believe he was referring to his girlfriend being left off the team.\n\nBild reported that the German Athletics Association stated in a press release, \"The decision for the final cast of the squad, with Alica Schmidt, Jean Paul Bredau, Manuel Sanders and Eileen Demes, was made unanimously by the DLV coach team with the leading national coach Julian Reus, Volker Beck, J\u00f6rg M\u00f6ckel and Sven Buggel, the home coach of Alica Schmidt, Luna Bulmahn and Jean Paul Bredau.\"\n\nAs a result of their comments, Luna Bulmahn, who was supposed to travel to Paris on Monday, was told to stay home and will not get to compete in the woman's 4\u00d7400 which begins on Friday, while Bredau has apologized to his team and has been placed on probation.\n\n\"There were disagreements beforehand,\" Schmidt said about the drama. \"I have to say, we are a team. We should stick together. We should trust what the coaches decide and be mentally ready accordingly. Everyone prepares here for three years. And anyone who stands here and doesn't fully support the relay - I find that difficult.\"", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "douglas_charles@brobible.com", "name": "Douglas Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alica_Schmidt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alica Schmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Athletics_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German Athletics Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Reus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Reus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Alica-Schmidt-and-Luna-Bulmahn-of-Team-Germany.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793084", "eventUri": "eng-9793084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

We mean... the woman does have over 5 MILLION Instagram followers and over 250k subscribers on her YouTube channel. Her celebrity is probably good for German sports.\n\nBut you could see why Luna was unhappy about it. The changeup not only meant she couldn't run, she also couldn't compete alongside her boyfriend Jean Paul Bredau in the event. Ouch.\n\nIs Luna really faster than Alica? And if so did it cost the team? They finished behind Team Great Britain in their final heat. And GB went on to compete in the finals, where they placed third, after the Netherlands and Team USA. (You can watch the race HERE!) So if they were a little faster could they have been up there on that podium getting bronze? Hmm...\n\nWhat do YOU think?

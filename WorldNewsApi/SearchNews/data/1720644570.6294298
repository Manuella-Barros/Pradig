Scott Morley, former proprietor of Morley\u2019s Magic Theater in Butler, was arrested May 15 for possession of images of child sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. Police recovered the disturbing images from his computer and found a pair of girls\u2019 underwear in his home. The 48-year-old was best known as Morley the Magician, working children\u2019s parties throughout the tri-state area. He and his soon-to-be ex-wife also owned and operated Morley\u2019s Magic Shop in Butler since 2014, offering after-school programs and magic and puppet-making workshops. During the holidays, Morley\u2019s Magic Theater welcomed children in for Christmas pictures \u2014 with the Morleys playing Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Since the bust, Morley has made his social media pages and website disappear. Morley\u2019s estranged wife, Britni Morley, sits on Butler\u2018s borough council. While she has not been charged with any crimes, seven Butler parents who spoke to The Post on condition of anonymity accused her of knowing about her ex-husband\u2019s crimes and demand she steps down. The Morleys share two young daughters, and all four performed as an act until late last year. The couple separated in February and Britni filed for divorce in March. An alleged witness came forward in April, according to an arrest affidavit. He was hired to paint the theater inside Morley\u2019s Magic Shop, and completed the job in 2022. At some point during the renovation, the worker allegedly stumbled upon a bag containing the underwear and a number of USB flash drives. The purported witness, authorities allege in the affidavit, confronted Morley about the horrific find, and the magician began smashing the thumb drives with a hammer. The affidavit doesn\u2019t mention why the accuser waited so long to come forward. Some in Butler believe Britni knew what was going on well before his arrest. The councilwoman\u2019s father, Walter Orcutt, is also an area politician, serving as Blairstown\u2019s deputy mayor. Britni Morley\u2019s divorce attorney, Andrew DeLaney, said his client cooperated fully with the investigation into her husband. \u201cAny suggestions of wrongdoing on her part are baseless, disgusting, and ultimately destructive to the criminal justice process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look to conclude the divorce so that my client can focus on raising her two children and providing for them financially and emotionally.\u201d Parents are expected to turn out in force for the next Butler council meeting on June 18 to demand Britni Morley\u2019s resignation. \u201cMy children attended the drop-off programs and we were deceived by Britni, who served our children up on a platter for Scott\u2019s fantasies,\u201d another mom told The Post. \u201cI am disgusted, appalled, saddened, and angry. Only because of his wife did I trust them with my daughter and son. \u201cHe needs to be put in jail along with his wife for knowing,\u201d the parent added. Another mother said the Butler community wants answers \u2014 including whether the magician had any pictures of their children. \u201cShe is still sitting on the council, and she still has access to children,\u201d the mom said. \u201cI am not sure why she hasn\u2019t been charged.\u201d \u201cTo find out about Scott and his sick secrets was gut wrenching,\u201d mom Candida Santee said to The Post. \u201cI think many of us are just so distraught over Britni and Scott\u2019s actions and lack of empathy towards the families.\u201d Prosecutors said the probe into Scott Morley began recently, \u201cwhen the Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received an anonymous tip.\u201d The affidavit alleges Morley told cops he had \u201capproximately 50 questionable images\u201d on his phone, but several\u201d more on different devices. When questioned about the images, he told cops he \u201cpreferred the young ones.\u201d The affidavit claims he allegedly admitted using the underwear and the illegal images for self-gratification. Morley also allegedly told investigators after his arrest he\u2019d been collecting child porn since 1996. He was released from custody without bail. He\u2019s prohibited from using the internet and cannot have any contact with minors. Morley did not respond to requests for comment. His attorney, Robert Bianchi, said his \u201cclient maintains his innocence, and we\u2019re satisfied that the court saw fit to release him over the objections of the prosecutor.\u201d Many of the parents who spoke to The Post claim they\u2019ve tried reaching out to Butler Mayor Ryan Martinez through his personal Facebook page as well as via calls and texts, asking if Morley plans to step down. They allege he\u2019s responded by blocking them. \u201cThere seems to be a big effort to silence the parents, and protect Britni,\u201d posited one of the anonymous parents. Martinez, an attorney, appointed Scott Morley to the borough\u2019s Economic Development Commission in February 2023. He\u2019s said to have referred Britni Morley to her divorce lawyer. He didn\u2019t return calls and emails seeking comment. Butler\u2019s borough administrator, Jim Lampmann, told The Post, \u201cThe Mayor, like all borough officials, certainly understands and shares the concerns and outrage these charges have generated. This matter is being addressed by the appropriate authorities and they, not Facebook, need to be the source for information and comment to prevent the dissemination of misinformation and protect the victims, families, and all involved in this matter.\u201d", "summary": "Angry parents in a New Jersey suburb are calling on a local politician to step down following the recent arrest of her ex-husband \u2014 a disgraced children's magician \u2014 on child-porn charges.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/disgraced-kids-magician-arrested-on-child-porn-charges/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/sunday-news-scott-morley-48-83362434.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:43:46", "author": "Chris Harris", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.069}

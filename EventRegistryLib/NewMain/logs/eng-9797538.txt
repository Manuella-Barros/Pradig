The helicopter had departed from Kathmandu and was en route to Syaphrubensi when it crashed, a source at the Tribhuvan International Airport told the Himalayan Times.\n\nSubash Jha, spokesperson of Tribhuvan International Airport, told Kathmandu Post that the 9N-AJD chopper belonging to Air Dynasty took off from Kathmandu at 1:54 pm for Syaprubesi, Rasuwa. The chopper was piloted by Captain Arun Malla and was carrying four Chinese nationals. A search and rescue team has been mobilised to the site, said an Army spokesperson.\n\nThe chopper lost contact just three minutes after the take-off at the Kathmandu Airport. The incident took place weeks after a small plane belonging to Saurya Airlines skidded off the runway of the TIA and crashed after takeoff on July 24, killing 18 people while the pilot was the lone survivor. The incident put the spotlight back on Nepal's poor safety record, as nearly 350 people have died in plane or helicopter crashes in the Himalayan country since 2000.\n\nThe plane, carrying two crew members and 17 technicians, was going for regular maintenance to Nepal's new Pokhara airport, which opened in January and is equipped with aircraft maintenance hangars, they said. \"Shortly after takeoff ... the aircraft veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway,\" the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement.\n\nEighteen of those on board were Nepali citizens while one engineer was from Yemen, Saurya said. \"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,\" said Tej Bahadur Poudyal, the spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. Authorities recovered the black box of the aircraft a day after the incident and handed it over to a probe team formed to inquire into the tragic accident.\n\nNepal's poor aviation safety record has been attributed to multiple reasons - from the rough mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, poor maintenance and aircraft training as well as lack of proper infrastructure and maintenance of aircraft. Furthermore, Nepal has some of the world's most strenuous and remote runways, which pose a challenge for even experienced pilots. This came to the limelight after a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara in January 2023, killing all 72 passengers on board.\n\nThe mountainous country sees frequent fluctuations in the weather and it is difficult to operate a flight without a proper weather forecasting mechanism. The deadliest aviation incident occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people. There have been more than 20 crashes in the last decade alone.\n\nALSO READ | Nepal's unfortunate history of plane crashes: A look at major aviation accidents since 2000 | LIST", "source": {"uri":

The crash has sent shockwaves through the region, prompting an outpouring of condolences and calls for investigations into the cause of the mishap.\n\nThe ill-fated helicopter, bearing the registration number 9N-AJD, belonged to Nepal Dynasty Airlines. Scheduled to fly to the Rhesus region, the aircraft took off from Kathmandu at 1.45pm on Wednesday, only to lose contact with the control tower just three minutes into the flight. It subsequently crashed in the Nuwakot area, where local residents witnessed smoke and flames billowing from the mountainside, prompting immediate alerts to authorities.\n\nAccording to the Tribhuvan International Airport Rescue Centre, the helicopter was carrying four Chinese passengers along with a Nepalese pilot. Rescuers on the scene have confirmed the discovery of all five deceased individuals, bringing a sombre conclusion to the search and rescue operations.\n\nIn response to the tragedy, the Nepalese Prime Minister's Office issued a press release on the same afternoon expressing profound sorrow and condolences for the victims of the crash.

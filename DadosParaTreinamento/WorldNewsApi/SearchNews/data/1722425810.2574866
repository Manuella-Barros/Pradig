{"id": 243228770, "title": "Iranians Await Results In Snap Presidential Vote Amid Mounting Anger Over Policies", "text": "Millions of ordinary Iranians, fed up with a flailing economy and the lack of social and political freedoms, are expected to stay at home when the country holds a presidential election on June 28. A low turnout, which experts say is likely, would underscore the challenge to the legitimacy of Iran\u2019s ruling clerical establishment amid rising anti-government sentiment. Among those who will boycott the upcoming election is Mojgan Ilanlou, a documentary filmmaker and women\u2019s rights activist based in Tehran. The outspoken Ilanlou was arrested and jailed for her involvement in the monthslong nationwide antiestablishment protests that rocked the Islamic republic in 2022. She was later released under an amnesty. Now, she says she will stay away from the polls as a form of peaceful civil protest against the authorities, who have cracked down on protesters with lethal force. \u201cI have no representative in this election to vote for\u2026so maybe when they realize they need my vote and that I don\u2019t easily sell my vote, something might change,\u201d Ilanlou told RFE/RL\u2019s Radio Farda. Elections in the Islamic republic are tightly controlled with candidates being preselected by an unelected body dominated by hard-liners. The six candidates cleared to run in the upcoming election are all men, most are hard-liners, and some have ties to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the elite branch of Iran\u2019s armed forces. \u201cNot only me but, I believe, a large group of people have reached the understanding that no change comes from the ballot box in Iran,\u201d Ilanlou said. She laughed off assertions that people boycotting the election were seeking to topple the clerical regime, arguing that the authorities \u201care ruling in such a way that they are taking care of it themselves.\u201d Women's Rights Not A Priority Unprecedented antiestablishment protests erupted in Iran following the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, in police custody after she was arrested for allegedly wearing her mandatory hijab, or head scarf, improperly. Ilanlou was among the first women to publicly ditch her hijab during the protests. Women, some of whom cut their hair and burned their head scarves in public, were at the forefront of the demonstrations. The 53-year-old was detained by security forces and jailed for four months for posting pictures of herself on social media without the hijab. During previous elections, Ilanlou said candidates would often talk about women\u2019s rights and make pledges on the campaign trail that they could not keep. But that is not the case this year. \u201cThis time around, the candidates don\u2019t even talk about women at all\u2026it is as though there is no such thing as women, women\u2019s demands, or equality,\u201d Ilanlou said. \u201cThey act like they don\u2019t need women\u2019s votes. They\u2019ll see the consequence at the ballot box.\u201d She said that the lone reformist, Masud Pezeshkian, is the only candidate so far to broach the subject of the notorious morality police, which enforces the strict Islamic dress code. But, she added, Pezeshkian had not actually said anything to excite voters. \u201cHe says he\u2019s opposed to the morality police. So what? We\u2019re opposed to it, too.\u201d Ilanlou said. \u201cFix the crisis, if you can.\u201d Written by Kian Sharifi based on an interview by Kianush Farid of RFE/RL\u2019s Radio Farda.", "summary": "Iranians await results on June 29 from a snap presidential election triggered by the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.", "url": "https://www.rferl.org/a/iranians-await-results-snap-presidential-vote-amid-mounting-anger/33013687.html", "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/17e8677d-865a-4c38-b4a6-e1a6a6d98039_w1080_h608.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:18:21", "author": "Rfe/rl's Radio Farda", "authors": ["Rfe/rl's Radio Farda"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.125}

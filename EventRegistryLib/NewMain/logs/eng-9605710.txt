(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nWith first-line center Roope Hintz in the lineup again, the Dallas Stars suddenly have one of their top goal-scorers back in form: linemate Jason Robertson.\n\nHintz had an immediate impact in his return after missing four games with a lower-body injury.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone doubted that there would be,\" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said. \"I think 'Robo' probably enjoyed it the most.\"\n\nAfter 10 games without a goal, Robertson had a playoff hat track in Game 3 of the Western Conference Final against Edmonton on Monday night. Hintz had the primary assists on the first two goals in a 2 1/2-minute span that got the Stars even, and was also on the ice for Robertson's third that was the game-winning goal.\n\n\"You could see the speed really drive our line through the neutral zone,\" Robertson said. \"It was a race (to the puck) and he won almost all of them, if not all of them. So, yeah, it was great.\"\n\nDallas takes a 2-1 series lead into Game 4 on Wednesday night, and maybe Hintz and Robertson are getting on track at the right time with the Stars trying to get to their second Stanley Cup Final in five seasons.\n\nHintz had only one goal without any assists in the first eight playoff games. He then broke through with a goal and three assists in Game 2 of the second-round series against Colorado, the most recent home game he played, and had another assist in the following game before leaving hurt in the first period of Game 4 at the Avalanche on May 13.\n\nThe 27-year-old has scored at least 30 goals in each of the past three regular seasons. He was the Stars' top scorer in the playoffs last year with 24 points (10 goals and 14 assists) when they got to Game 6 of the West final before a loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\"You take those type of players out of your lineup, it affects all kinds of parts of your games, and individuals in your lineup,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"That's the reality ... there's a trickle effect.\"\n\nDeBoer lauded the Stars for how they \"gutted it out\" when Hintz was watching the games instead of playing them. The coach said he was really proud of how they handled his absence.\n\n\"Just brings so much to our lineup,\" said Wyatt Johnston, their 21-year-old center. \"It hard to, you know, just kind of explain. He just does so much.\"\n\nRobertson didn't have a goal in any of the six games -- two in the regular season before the playoffs -- that Hintz has missed this season. Robertson has 116 goals over the past three regular seasons.\n\n\"Goal scorers like him, you need one to drop. And then all of a sudden it looks like a soccer net. He's always been streaky,\" DeBoer said. \"Obviously having Roope back helps, but, you know, I've liked Robo's game even with Roope out of the lineup. ... Without our No. 1 center, I thought everyone was doing some heavy lifting. Maybe it didn't show on the stat sheet, but, we won games against really good teams all kinds of different ways.\"\n\nAfter being the NHL's best road team in the regular season, the Stars are 6-1 on the road this postseason. That includes winning all three Game 3s in these playoffs. They also won their previous two Game 4s, road games at Vegas and Colorado, the past two Stanley Cup champions.\n\nDallas had late empty-net goals in each of the past two games against the Oilers to finish with two-goal wins. Edmonton was 6-4 in one-goal games this postseason before that. The Stars are 4-3 in one-goal games, and before this series had split four other two-goal games when there were late empty-net goals.\n\nNot a single hat was thrown on the ice after Robertson scored his third goal Monday night. Not surprising, since the Stars were far away from home.\n\n\"I mentally threw mine,\" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said.\n\nJoe Pavelski, Denis Gurianov and Joel Kiviranta have also had playoff hat tricks for the Stars at Rogers Place in Edmonton, but none of those were against the Oilers, and there weren't any fans in the stands then to throw hats.\n\nThat was during the 2020 playoffs in the

DeBoer credits Hintz's return in Game 3 of the Western Conference Final as a reason why Dallas won the contest. Hintz recorded two assists for Dallas in a 5-3 win over Edmonton.\n\n\"We gutted it out while (Hintz) was out of the lineup,\" DeBoer said, per ESPN. \"It wasn't pretty, it wasn't as pretty as it was tonight when he was out, but we still found ways. Guys still found ways to contribute without a key player.\n\n\"That's what I'm most proud of. It was great that he was back tonight, but I'm really proud of how we handled his absence.\"\n\nStars' series against Oilers\n\nDallas takes a 2-1 lead in the Western Conference Final against the Oilers, after winning Game 3. The Stars are on a tear, taking the last two games of the series. The Stars passed the puck around with ease in Game 3, as several players got involved in the high-powered offense. Hintz wasn't the only Star to finish the game with two assists, as Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn also had two each. The Stars also got a hat trick from Jason Robertson.\n\nHintz returned to the lineup for Dallas after missing the last several games with an upper-body injury. He hadn't played in any of the previous contests of the series. His last appearance was in Game 4 of the team's previous series against the Colorado Avalanche. Hintz gives the Stars another experienced puck handler, who can score and distribute. In this year's playoffs, Hintz has 8 total points including 6 assists.\n\nHow the season has gone for Hintz\n\nHintz's presence on the ice this season has helped Dallas finish at the top of the Central Division. Dallas notched a total of 113 points during the regular season, including 52 victories.\n\nThis campaign, Hintz recorded 65 points including 30 goals. He has played for the Stars since the 2018-19 campaign. He has spent his entire career in Dallas, and is searching for his first Stanley Cup Championship. The Stars only need two more wins in the series against the Oilers to make it a step closer to getting there.\n\nEven though he hasn't won a championship, Hintz has played a lot of postseason hockey. The center has played in 75 postseason games, and has 57 points in the playoffs. His plus-minus is +4 in the playoffs. It makes perfect sense that Dallas is a much better team when they have the center on the ice.\n\nThe Stars have only one Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. It was 25 years ago, in the 1998-99 season. The team last appeared in the NHL Finals in 2020, but lost the Stanley Cup to Tampa Bay. Hintz was on that club, and probably remembers that loss vividly. If Dallas keeps winning, the center will get a chance to redeem himself.\n\nGame 4 of the Western Conference Final is on Wednesday, at 8:30 Eastern.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_adducchio@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Benjamin Adducchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus\u2013minus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plus\u2013minus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Stars-news-Pete-DeBoer-drops-truth-bomb-on-Roope-Hintzs-Game-3-injury-return.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605710", "eventUri": "eng-9605710", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Hintz had the primary assists on the first two goals in a 2 1/2-minute span that got the Stars even, and was also on the ice for Robertson's third that was the game-winning goal.\n\n\"You could see the speed really drive our line through the neutral zone,\" Robertson said. \"It was a race (to the puck) and he won almost all of them, if not all of them. So, yeah, it was great.\"\n\nDallas takes a 2-1 series lead into Game 4 on Wednesday night, and maybe Hintz and Robertson are getting on track at the right time with the Stars trying to get to their second Stanley Cup Final in five seasons.\n\nHintz had only one goal without any assists in the first eight playoff games. He then broke through with a goal and three assists in Game 2 of the second-round series against Colorado, the most recent home game he played, and had another assist in the following game before leaving hurt in the first period of Game 4 at the Avalanche on May 13.\n\nThe 27-year-old has scored at least 30 goals in each of the past three regular seasons. He was the Stars' top scorer in the playoffs last year with 24 points (10 goals and 14 assists) when they got to Game 6 of the West final before a loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\"You take those type of players out of your lineup, it affects all kinds of parts of your games, and individuals in your lineup,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"That's the reality ... there's a trickle effect.\"\n\nDeBoer lauded the Stars for how they \"gutted it out\" when Hintz was watching the games instead of playing them. The coach said he was really proud of how they handled his absence.\n\n\"Just brings so much to our lineup,\" said Wyatt Johnston, their 21-year-old center. \"It hard to, you know, just kind of explain. He just does so much.\"\n\nRobertson didn't have a goal in any of the six games -- two in the regular season before the playoffs -- that Hintz has missed this season. Robertson has 116 goals over the past three regular seasons.\n\n\"Goal scorers like him, you need one to drop. And then all of a sudden it looks like a soccer net. He's always been streaky,\" DeBoer said. \"Obviously having Roope back helps, but, you know, I've liked Robo's game even with Roope out of the lineup. ... Without our No. 1 center, I thought everyone was doing some heavy lifting. Maybe it didn't show on the stat sheet, but, we won games against really good teams all kinds of different ways.\"\n\nAfter being the NHL's best road team in the regular season, the Stars are 6-1 on the road this postseason. That includes winning all three Game 3s in these playoffs. They also won their previous two Game 4s, road games at Vegas and Colorado, the past two Stanley Cup champions.\n\nDallas had late empty-net goals in each of the past two games against the Oilers to finish with two-goal wins. Edmonton was 6-4 in one-goal games this postseason before that. The Stars are 4-3 in one-goal games, and before this series had split four other two-goal games when there were late empty-net goals.\n\nNot a single hat was thrown on the ice after Robertson scored his third goal Monday night. Not surprising, since the Stars were far away from home.\n\n\"I mentally threw mine,\" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said.\n\nJoe Pavelski, Denis Gurianov and Joel Kiviranta have also had playoff hat tricks for the Stars at Rogers Place in Edmonton, but none of those were against the Oilers, and there weren't any fans in the stands then to throw hats.\n\nThat was during the 2020 playoffs in the Canadian bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kiviranta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Kiviranta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Gurianov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denis Gurianov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee9210c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+146/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2Fb8%2F8ce100e0de6a0b25c7d8935b3020%2F6276c1c747cd4b55a6915bd7e2683277", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605710", "eventUri": "eng-9605710", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1456, "textEnd": 1462}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

He's one of our best defensive players, one of our best penalty killers, creates offense.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the top-line centerman for the Stars for the last few years, Hintz has to be versatile in that way.

He brings such a speed element to a game. When I have a chance to play with him, I've always enjoyed it. He creates so much space.\n\n\"I think Robo probably enjoyed it the most.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHintz set up both of Jason Robertson's second-period goals to allow Dallas to climb back into the game after a lackluster first-period performance that saw Edmonton leading 2-0. The Stars were able to claim a 5-3 victory behind that second-period effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly in the second, Hintz skated along the boards and found Robertson approaching the left circle. That's where he hit him for the first goal. Just 2:30 later, Hintz fought for a rebound in front of Edmonton goalie Stuart Skinner before feeding it to Robertson, who scored on a backhanded shot.\n\n\"Obviously, you can see the speed really drive our line through the neutral zone,\" Robertson said of Hintz. \"He was first on pucks on the forechecks. It was a race, and he won almost all of them, if not all of them. It was a great game for him to come back. I know it's not easy coming back after having a week or two off, but it didn't look like he missed a beat.\"\n\nRobertson had gone 10 games without a goal before Hintz's return. He and his linemate had instant chemistry when they were reunited, even being on a new line with Seguin on the right wing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHintz had two shots on goal and generated 15 scoring chances.\n\nDefensively, Dallas regained one of its top defensive forwards and penalty killers. Hintz played 1:28 on the penalty kill during which the Stars shut out Edmonton, holding the Oilers 0-for-2 on the night. He had a blocked shot and a hit as well.\n\nHintz's presence also freed up other playmakers. DeBoer spoke about Wyatt Johnston on Sunday, who had gone scoreless in all four games without Hintz.\n\n\"I think he has a little more freedom offensively when Roope's in the lineup because that's the matchup he gets,\" DeBoer said of Johnston. \"He doesn't have to do that defensive heavy lifting that Roope usually does.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat impact was seen, as Johnston scored Dallas' third goal of the night to give his team the lead midway through the third period.\n\n\"He just brings so much to our lineup. It's hard to explain,\" Johnston said of Hintz. \"It affects everyone.\"\n\nNo one in the Stars' locker room doubted Hintz's ability to make a meaningful impact in his return. It will relieve some pressure on the rest of the team as the Western Conference finals series continues.\n\nBut what impressed DeBoer the most was what his team managed to do in the four games without him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When you consider what our team did playing the tail end of the Colorado series and the early part of this series without our No. 1 center, I thought everyone was doing some heavy lifting,\" DeBoer said. \"It wasn't pretty. It wasn't as pretty as it was tonight, but we still found ways. Guys still found ways to contribute without a key player. That's what I'm most proud of. It's great that he was back tonight, but I'm really proud of how we handled his absence.\"\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreStars-Oilers playoff central: How to watch, storylines, schedule and moreFull coverage: Stars outlast Oilers in Game 3 to take lead in Western Conference finals\n\nOn X/Twitter: @Lassimak\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Skinner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_rink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey rink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RFJFCDYK35DZNBZZJLHIMUP72I.jpg?auth=e43c104f689fe68af8dbfa59dacffe9834c80da75f05bebda03f4ed191fe717a&height=467&width=830&smart=true&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605710", "eventUri": "eng-9605710", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He used Skinner's skate as a ramp, allowing the puck to hit the goalie from behind and bounce into the net.\n\nIt was a move he learned from Stars goalie coach Jeff Reese.\n\n\"We work on a lot of stuff with our goalie coach, with [Scott Wedgewood], with [Jake Oettinger] in practice, trying to find ways to score goals,\" Robertson said postgame. \"It's hard when goalies are too good in this league. You try to find something that might work. I will say, having those couple of goals before gave me the confidence to try it and see what happens.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Stars hired Reese in 2015 as their goaltending coach from the Philadelphia Flyers. He has been with the organization through five head coaches and five starting goalies.\n\nHe played 11 seasons in the NHL for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, Hartford Whalers, Tampa Bay Lightning and New Jersey Devils in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nWhile Reese was hired to work with goalies like Jake Oettinger and Scott Wedgewood -- turning Oettinger into one of the rising stars at the position -- his knowledge now benefits the skaters as well.\n\n\"Reeser does a lot of work behind the scenes with those guys, just on tendencies and scouting reports and things,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"Robo and Matt Duchene, in particular, are two guys that spend a lot of time looking at those reports and then spending time with Jeff. They talk the same language, and I think Robo's a very analytical player as far as scoring goes. He sees the game differently than most people, including myself.

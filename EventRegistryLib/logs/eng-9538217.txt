Here, Norris walked behind the barricades, chanting and yelling at officers lined up on the opposite side of the barricades and in front of the Capitol building. Norris could be heard chanting, \"Stop the steal!\", \"Whose house?\", and \"Fight for Trump!\", among other things, almost always projecting his voice through a megaphone.\n\nUsing his megaphone, Norris yelled at officers and spoke with individuals in the crowd. Norris told one individual in the crowd, \"I got bad news. We're pushing through. You better get down with us or back off because we're pushing through.\" At approximately 1:45 p.m., together with other rioters in the crowd, Norris allegedly pushed the metal fencing that formed the barricade against U.S. Capitol Police Officers, who were attempting to prevent rioters from advancing towards the Capitol building.\n\nPhotos and videos from various angles allegedly depict Norris pushing the barricade against police officers.\n\nCourt documents say that Norris breached the barricades after the push. Still, officers were able to reestablish the police line and marshal rioters like Norris, who had broken through back behind the barricades. While pointing to the Capitol building, Norris again yelled at police officers, stating, \"We don't want you guys. We want them,\" referring to elected officials in the building.\n\nAt approximately 2:00 p.m., while Norris was still behind the barricades, third-party video and closed-circuit video from the Capitol show rioters pushing the metal barricades against U.S. Capitol Police on a second occasion. Norris allegedly moved some of these barricades, and rioters were able to breach and move toward the Capitol successfully. Norris then allegedly moved forward to join the advancing crowd of rioters.\n\nIt is alleged that Norris and other rioters advanced into the restricted area of the Capitol grounds and towards the Capitol building. According to a third-party video, Norris was one of the first rioters to reach the East Central Steps of the Capitol building. He ascended the East Central Steps, where another police line had formed halfway to the top. Norris was directly in front of the police line, and he continued to yell at police officers through a megaphone. Among other things, Norris motioned with his left hand towards the Capitol building and told police officers, \"Send those m -- f -- out to talk to us,\" referring to elected officials in the Capitol building.\n\nVideo footage shows that officers were unable to hold the police line and were forced to retreat to the terrace level of the Capitol building. Norris is alleged to have continued to advance toward the building and was one of the first rioters to reach the top of the East Central Stairs. Norris, along with other rioters, allegedly surrounded police officers near the Rotunda door and continued to rush towards the building. Norris can be heard yelling, \"Push forward!,\" and chanting, \"USA!\" Norris is accused of pushing into at least one officer's shield.\n\nEventually, Norris is seen in video footage close to the Rotunda doors attempting to get inside the building. U.S. Capitol Police later deployed gas, and Norris and others retreated from the doors into the larger crowd.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the FBI's Cleveland and Washington Field Offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland19.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.cleveland19.com"},

We're pushing through. You better get down with us or back off because we're pushing through,\" Norris reportedly told officers, according to his criminal complaint.\n\nPhotos and videos show Norris and other rioters pushing the barricade's metal fencing against Capitol Police officers who were trying to stop the mob's advance. At about 2 p.m., surveillance footage shows Norris move some of the barricades, allowing rioters to advance.\n\nThird-party video shows Norris was one of the first rioters to make it to the East Central Steps of the Capitol building. He and others ascended the steps and were met with another line of police officers. Norris stood out in front with his megaphone, shouting for officers to bring out the elected officials inside \"to talk to us,\" reads the release.\n\nWhen officers retreated to the terrace, unable to hold the line, Norris was one of the first to reach the top of the steps. He and others allegedly surrounded officers near the Rotunda door, continuing to push toward the building. Norris allegedly pushed into one officer's shield and could be heard yelling, \"Push forward!\" and chanting, \"USA!\"\n\nVideo footage shows Norris trying to get inside the Rotunda. Capitol police officers then deployed gas, and Norris retreated into the crowd, reads the release.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Norris was expected to make his initial appearance in Ohio's Northern District federal court later Friday.\n\nNorris' case is being investigated by the FBI's Cleveland and Washington field officers, according to the release.\n\nNearly 1,400 people from nearly all U.S. states have been charged in connection to the Jan. 6 attack, according to the Department of Justice, including nearly 500 people who have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, which is a felony.\n\nAnyone with tips regarding the Jan. 6 attack can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8

We had the perfect strategy. It all paid off,\" he added.\n\n\"I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,\" he added.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in the rain, costing him dearly.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres.\n\n\"They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close to it, but for one reason or another, he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job, and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nAs in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities.\n\nFormer France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race.\n\nTrump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race.\n\nNorris's parents were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris congratulations.\n\nNorris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com",

(AP) -- Lando Norris should take a lesson from his last big party perhaps tone down the celebration for his first career Formula 1 victory.\n\nHis reaction following the Sunday victory in the Miami Grand Prix showed the British driver probably doesn't plan to miss a beat.\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\n\"I'm just really proud. A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way,\" Norris said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race on Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning that he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nLando Norris has won his maiden Grand Prix (David Davies/PA)\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nMax Verstappen\u00b4s winning streak is over (AP)\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line 7.6 seconds clear.\n\nI guess that is how it is done. Finally. Oh, I am so happy Lando Norris\n\n\"Whooooooooooo, whooooooooo, I love you all,\" yelled Norris over the radio after becoming Britain's 21st Grand Prix winner. \"Thank you so much. We did it, Will (Joseph, Norris' race engineer). We did it.\n\n\"I guess that is how it is done. Finally. Oh, I am so happy. I knew it when I came in this morning. I said today is the day, full of opportunities. I nailed it, you nailed it, thank you so much.\n\n\"Thanks mum, thanks dad, this one is for my grandma, thank you very much.\"\n\nAfter stepping out of the machine that carried him to victory, Norris put down his yellow crash helmet before running and leaping into the arms of his mechanics.\n\nDaniel Ricciardo was quick to congratulate Norris (AP)\n\nThey hoisted him into the air as a host of drivers - including fellow Briton George Russell and Daniel Ricciardo, the last man to win for McLaren in Monza in 2021 - came over to congratulate Norris.\n\n\"About time, huh,\" said Norris, who was interviewed by 2009 world champion Jenson Button.\n\n\"What a race. It has been a long-time coming. Finally I have managed to do it. I am so happy I have delivered for the team. I am finally on top. I am over the moon.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type":

(AP) -- Lando Norris should take a lesson from his last big party and perhaps tone down the celebration for his first career Formula 1 victory.\n\nHis reaction following the Sunday victory in the Miami Grand Prix showed the British driver probably doesn't plan to miss a beat.\n\n\"Tonight's going to be a great time,\" Norris promised. \"I'm just really proud. A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\n\"I'm going to go all night,\" Norris promised of the post-race party. \"I may have more than a bandage on my nose.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race on Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning that he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nAs for his incident in the chicane, Verstappen tried to joke about it hitting the cone.\n\n\"I didn't like it. So I took it out,\" he said. \"And tested the front wing. So crash-test done.\"\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News

A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bear hug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\n\"I'm going to go all night,\" Norris promised of the post-race party. \"I may have more than a bandage on my nose.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead ahead Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6 seconds ahead of Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nAs for his incident in the chicane, Verstappen tried to joke about it hitting the cone.\n\n\"I didn't like it. So I took it out,\" he said. \"And tested the front wing. So crash-test done.\"\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory against Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long

A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\nF1 now makes 3 stops a season in the United States. Could Miami become a victim of oversaturation?\n\n\"I'm going to go all night,\" Norris promised of the post-race party. \"I may have more than a bandage on my nose.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race on Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning that he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nAs for his incident in the chicane, Verstappen tried to joke about it hitting the cone.\n\n\"I didn't like it. So I took it out,\" he said. \"And tested the front wing. So crash-test done.\"\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.", "source": {"uri": "thejewishvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"},

The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line 7.6 seconds clear.\n\n\"Whooooooooooo, whooooooooo, I love you all,\" yelled Norris over the radio after becoming Britain's 21st Grand Prix winner. \"Thank you so much. We did it, Will (Joseph, Norris' race engineer). We did it.\n\n\"I guess that is how it is done. Finally. Oh, I am so happy. I knew it when I came in this morning. I said today is the day, full of opportunities. I nailed it, you nailed it, thank you so much.\n\n\"Thanks mum, thanks dad, this one is for my grandma, thank you very much.\"\n\nAfter stepping out of the machine that carried him to victory, Norris put down his yellow crash helmet before running and leaping into the arms of his mechanics.\n\nThey hoisted him into the air as a host of drivers - including fellow Briton George Rusell and Daniel Ricciardo, the last man to win for McLaren in Monza in 2021 - came over to congratulate Norris.\n\n\"About time, huh,\" said Norris, who was interviewed by 2009 world champion Jenson Button.\n\n\"What a race. It has been a long-time coming. Finally I have managed to do it. I am so happy I have delivered for the team. I am finally on top. I am over the moon.\"", "source": {"uri": "rhyljournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rhyl, Prestatyn and Abergele Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AP\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nBreathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.\n\nVerstappen, who began on pole , had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.\n\nIt looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.\n\nAustralian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.\n\nCrucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.\n\nThe safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.\n\nNorris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.\n\nIt was the first time Verstappen has been beaten on track, when he finished the race, since Ferrari's Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year.\n\nNorris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.\n\n\"About time huh?\" said Norris, \"I knew on Friday that we had the pace&mldr;today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,\" he added.\n\n'He deserves it'\n\n\"I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,\" he added.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in rain, costing him dearly.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres.\n\n\"They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nLeclerc echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh.\n\nAs in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities.\n\nFormer France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,\" he added.\n\n- 'He deserves it' -\n\n\"I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,\" he added.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in rain, costing him dearly.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres.\n\n\"They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nLeclerc echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh.\n\nAs in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities.\n\nFormer France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race.\n\nsev/rcw\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments More than 2,100

We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,\" he added.\n\n\"I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,\" he added.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in rain, costing him dearly.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres.\n\n\"They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nLeclerc echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@citizen.co.za", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line 7.6 seconds clear.\n\n\"Whooooooooooo, whooooooooo, I love you all,\" yelled Norris over the radio after becoming Britain's 21st Grand Prix winner. \"Thank you so much. We did it, Will (Joseph, Norris' race engineer). We did it.\n\n\"I guess that is how it is done. Finally. Oh, I am so happy. I knew it when I came in this morning. I said today is the day, full of opportunities. I nailed it, you nailed it, thank you so much.\n\n\"Thanks mum, thanks dad, this one is for my grandma, thank you very much.\"\n\nAfter stepping out of the machine that carried him to victory, Norris put down his yellow crash helmet before running and leaping into the arms of his mechanics.\n\nThey hoisted him into the air as a host of drivers - including fellow Briton George Rusell and Daniel Ricciardo, the last man to win for McLaren in Monza in 2021 - came over to congratulate Norris.\n\n\"About time, huh,\" said Norris, who was interviewed by 2009 world champion Jenson Button.\n\n\"What a race. It has been a long-time coming. Finally I have managed to do it. I am so happy I have delivered for the team. I am finally on top.

Few disputed his stardom, particularly given his performances in the past couple of seasons with McLaren. As he recently told The Athletic, \"My time is coming.\"\n\nIt was a big surprise to come so soon, while Max Verstappen and Red Bull remain such a dominant force, with 15-second margins of victory being the norm. It may have come with a slice of luck to win from fifth on the grid, yet it was a race the McLaren driver executed perfectly.\n\nNorris always vowed that when the opportunity arose to win a race, he'd take full advantage. Through the delirium of his radio message on the cool-down lap, he reminded his race engineer, Will Joseph, of a comment he made earlier in the day. \"I knew it when I came in this morning, I said today is a day full of opportunities,\" Norris said. \"I nailed it. You nailed it.\"\n\nA race win was not something Norris had experienced since his first weekend in Formula Two in April 2018. But this was the one he'd been working his whole career -- his whole life -- to make happen.\n\n\"It's been a long time coming,\" Norris said. \"Finally, I've managed to do it.\"\n\nMcLaren arrived in Miami armed with a raft of updates for Norris's car -- teammate Oscar Piastri only had some of the new parts -- and Norris said afterward that victory would have been far less likely without the performance boost the new parts offered.\n\nThere were clear signs of pace from Norris before the race. His SQ2 lap would've been quick enough for sprint race pole, only for him to wind up ninth on the grid and get taken out at the first corner. He didn't feel there was anything more in the car to qualify better than fifth on Saturday evening. Progress would be possible, yet a podium seemed like the best result on offer today.\n\nFor a brief moment at the first corner, Norris feared he would be taken out again as Sergio P\u00e9rez's lock-up threatened to cause an incident and forced the Ferraris wide. That allowed Piastri to slip through to third, which quickly became second after he passed Charles Leclerc. Down in sixth, Norris wasn't in the picture.\n\nBut he quickly settled into a good rhythm, putting pressure on P\u00e9rez for fifth. Even with DRS, he didn't have the straight-line advantage to make it past, prompting him to ease off and opt to save his tires. Once P\u00e9rez pitted and put Norris into free air, Joseph told Norris their target wasn't P\u00e9rez but Carlos Sainz, almost five seconds up the road. \"I'll go get him,\" replied Norris.\n\nSo, he did. Norris was the fastest man on the track in free air, cutting the gap to Sainz in half in a handful of laps. Verstappen had by now pitted for a fresh set of hard tires but wasn't lighting up the timesheets; Norris kept the gap stable at around 11 seconds, his old mediums still holding up well. The podium was well in sight, particularly as he moved into the lead when Piastri and Sainz pitted on the same lap.\n\nOpen road ahead. \"Clean air,\" said Joseph. \"Let's go.\" It'd be an advantage that Norris took without making a single overtake, as he noted to Verstappen in the cool-down room after the race, and would not relinquish.\n\nHe still needed something to fall his way for the win to manifest. An errant bollard coming onto the back straight, knocked out of place by Verstappen at the chicane, only led to a brief Virtual Safety Car. Not enough to give Norris a chance. He needed to pit soon and overtake Sainz, Leclerc, and Piastri even to have Verstappen in sight.\n\nBut when Kevin Magnussen's overzealous move on Logan Sargeant led to contact that sent the Williams car into the barrier and the safety car was deployed, that something Norris needed had arrived.\n\nThe safety car deployment came a fraction too late for Norris to pit immediately, but it didn't hurt him too badly as he came in the next lap. With six-lap fresher tires, Norris had an advantage that even the pace of Verstappen's Red Bull would struggle to overcome.\n\nVerstappen only had one proper attack against Norris on the restart, lurking to the outside at Turn 1. Norris covered off the inside and broke away through the high-speed section that suited his McLaren so well. He was over a second clear before DRS was activated on the second lap after the restart; Verstappen was losing all his time at the first corner to Norris, telling his engineer, \"I can't get the car to turn, it's a disaster.\" For once, the Dutchman had no answer to a setback.\n\nThe laps ticked by, Norris getting faster and faster, the gap to Verstappen growing a few tenths per lap even though the McLaren driver felt he was \"cruising.\" Norris knew the win was his for the taking. \"I could get my head down and push on,\" he said. \"I was confident I could take it from there.\"\n\nNorris's mind wandered a bit, the walls feeling ever closer and beckoning him to make a mistake. It prompted him to focus on going for fastest laps -- a plan he abandoned in the very final stages, knowing the fear it would have put into team principal Andrea Stella on the pit wall. Piastri, running fresh tires down the order after damage forced him to pit, took the fastest lap instead.\n\nNorris even started to consider what he would say or do upon crossing the line, admitting post-race that he struggled to come up with a natural response. One thought was repeating a comment made by Valtteri Bottas after winning the 2019 Australian Grand Prix (\"to whom it may concern, f -- you,\" but Norris deemed that \"copyrighted\").\n\nAs he sped toward his first career win, Norris also considered the journey that got him to this point. \"(It's) a bit lonely out there at times,\" Norris said. \"It's nice to reflect on everything you've done to get to this point.\"\n\nSix years in F1 and 110 races later. A life dedicated to racing. Norris punched the air and placed his hands on his helmet in disbelief after crossing the line. At last, he was an F1 race winner. Unfiltered thoughts followed on the radio, along with a word for his parents and his grandmother, who has been unwell lately. Norris revealed he'd told her he would win a race; he never thought it would come so soon.\n\nAfter congratulations from many of his peers walking through parc ferme, Norris was taken to the podium to hear the British national anthem ring out, closing his eyes and mouthing along to the final notes of \"God Save The King\" as it played at an F1 race in his honor for the very first time.\n\nThe traditions complete, Norris kick-started the celebrations by completing his trademark bottle 'smash', the sparkling wine inside shooting skyward. He joked post-race that he was shivering because he'd been covered in champagne. It's unlikely to be the last alcohol he has tonight. After all, it's a moment he could only celebrate once. McLaren Racing's CEO, Zak Brown, quickly informed Norris that the plan to fly out of Miami in a few hours had changed.\n\n\"I'm not going to sleep, I'm going all the way!\" Norris said. \"Tonight's going to be a good night.\"\n\nNorris's wait for this win has, in his own words, become a thing. Be it fans shouting at him for viral TikTok videos or the 'Lando No Wins' tag that became part of F1 social media's lexicon, there has been a long-held collective breath from this sport's community for him to finally reach the top step.\n\nNorris had never let the lack of a win bog him down too badly. But as much as he wanted to say it wasn't a weight on his shoulders, it was. Even a little bit.\n\n\"I've of course had my moments where I've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win,\" Norris said. \"But I wasn't worried. As much as a lot of people doubted that I was going to be able to put it together and win a race, I wasn't worried.\"\n\nThat confidence had only grown through the early part of this year, particularly as McLaren, the team Norris committed his long-term future to in January, maintained its place among the front-runners after the mid-season surge last year. The spark had been there throughout this season, even on Friday. \"Today, it definitely came back and turned into a little fire.\"\n\nNorris even referred to 'Lando No Wins' on his cool-down lap over the radio. He's always been light-hearted about the banter, scrolling Instagram and liking the comments thrown his way. \"I freaking love it,\" Norris said. \"It makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando No Wins'.\" But these little digs helped fuel him, igniting that fire and motivation.\n\n\"For me to finally prove the people wrong and to prove it to the people who didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face today,\" Norris said. \"So I thank all of them.\"\n\nThe first Lando Norris F1 victory. It's very unlikely to be the last.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_smith@theathletic.com", "name": "Luke Smith", "type":

It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6 seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E, and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

Trump's presence at the Miami International Autodrome brought some 'much-needed luck' for McLaren as they won their first race in three years. More importantly, it was Lando Norris who grabbed his maiden win in F1. With Norris finally breaking his duck, Karun Chandhok has joked that Trump may take credit for the same.\n\nTaking to X (earlier Twitter), the former F1 driver wrote, \"Hmmm.... How long before Trump claims credit as McLaren's lucky charm??\" Previously, Norris and McLaren have often witnessed luck go against them.\n\nHowever, the Briton had the luck go his way on this occasion. Soon after the 24-year-old brilliantly extended his first stint on the medium tire, a safety car came out following the collision between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant, thereby essentially giving the McLaren driver a free pit stop for the hards.\n\nFollowing the pit stop, Norris came out in the lead of the race, ahead of Max Verstappen. However, Norris' job had not finished yet. Once the safety car period ended, Norris quickly escaped the DRS zone by extending his lead by over a second from Verstappen after just the first lap.\n\nFrom there on, Norris calmly managed his pace and crossed the line 7.6 seconds ahead of Verstappen to win his maiden race. And with his win, Norris finally ended the pain of an unwanted record that he had registered to his name.\n\nAfter Lando Norris finished on the podium in Australia, he registered an unwanted record of having the most podium finishes without a race win. That run extended from 14 to 15 after Norris grabbed another podium in China.\n\nWhile Norris may still hold that unwanted record, he is unlikely to care about it anymore as he can finally call himself a race winner! The Briton clearly was relieved after the Miami GP as he told his team on the radio after the race,\n\n\"About time! What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it\".\n\nWith Norris winning the Miami GP, it also meant that Max Verstappen failed to win a race for the first time this season when he crossed the chequered flag.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured third place.\n\nVerstappen, starting from pole position, had claimed victory in four of the season's first five races and maintained his lead in the world championship standings.\n\nInitially, it seemed to be another routine race for Verstappen, who had won the two preceding Miami races, as he led until lap 24 when he made a pit stop and Norris's McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, briefly took the lead.\n\nPiastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead, and the British driver never looked back.\n\nCrucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.\n\nThe safety car was deployed after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing out a yellow flag.\n\nNorris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car, and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.\n\nIt was the first time Verstappen has been beaten on track when he finished the race, since Ferrari's Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year.\n\nNorris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.\n\n\"About time huh?\" said Norris, \"I knew on Friday that we had the pace ... today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,\" he added.\n\n\"I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,\" he added.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tire change early in rain, costing him dearly.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about a lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tires.\n\n\"They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nLeclerc echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh.\n\nAs in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities.\n\nFormer France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and former U.S. President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@dailysabah.com", "name":

He beat both Ferraris and Red Bulls fair and square,\" said Sky Sports F1's Martin Brundle.\n\n\"That is what will be extra satisfying about this victory.\"\n\nFighting back tears as his jubilant McLaren team lifted him aloft in the pit lane as wild celebrations commenced, Norris said: \"About time! What a race. It's been a long time coming.\n\n\"Finally I've managed to do it.\"\n\nWith no answer to friend and rival Norris' speed after the restart, Verstappen had to settle for a rare second place - just the second time in the world champion's past 23 race finishes that he has been beaten on track.\n\nFerrari had been expected to be the biggest threat to Verstappen after qualifying second and third but their challenge was stymied at the race start when the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri overtook both of their cars.\n\nCharles Leclerc eventually took the final podium position in third, two seconds behind Verstappen, with Carlos Sainz crossing the line fourth in the sister car.\n\nBut Sainz was handed a post-race five-second time penalty, dropping him behind Red Bull's Sergio Perez to fifth, for an earlier collision with Piastri at Turn 17 which broke the McLaren's front wing and forced the Australian into an emergency pit stop.\n\nPiastri dropped out of the points as a result to finish 13th.\n\nLewis Hamilton finished in the highest position of his difficult season so far in sixth after a strong race for Mercedes, finishing within two seconds of Perez.\n\nPerez had nearly wiped out team-mate Verstappen at the start of the race when he locked up and ran wide into the first corner.\n\nYuki Tsunoda beat the second Mercedes of George Russell to eighth to add to RB's points haul in Miami, with Fernando Alonso recovering from his disappointing qualifying to take ninth for Aston Martin.\n\nAt the sixth time of asking in 2024, Alpine opened their points account with Esteban Ocon racing hard to 10th.\n\nIn the world championship standings, Verstappen - the winner of Saturday's Sprint - leaves Miami with an increased advantage of 33 points over Perez, although fourth-placed Norris is now within 20 points of the Mexican.\n\nQuestions as to when and where Norris would eventually win his maiden grand prix had been growing since the middle of last season when McLaren's big step forward in performance had seen the Englishman consistently deliver podium finishes amid Verstappen's domination of the cherished top step.\n\nTwo weeks after another runner-up finish to Verstappen in China, McLaren arrived in Miami with an MCL38 car for Norris featuring an impressive raft of 10 different upgrades.\n\nThe car's initial performance in practice and then the opening stages of Sprint Qualifying on Friday had looked very promising, but then things again fell away as Norris qualified only ninth for the Sprint before being collected as an innocent party in the first-corner chaos that followed at the start of Saturday's 19-lap race.\n\nAnd although qualifying fifth for the main Grand Prix represented progress, McLaren did not appear in the mix to take on the Red Bulls and Ferraris for victory.\n\nBut Miami's 57-lap grand prix on a street track that had proved difficult to master for drivers all weekend had other ideas.\n\nAlthough he lost a place to his fast-starting team-mate Piastri on the first lap, Norris' consistent pace thereafter behind the top five was such that McLaren could extend his first stint and steadily gain the track position that proved so crucial.\n\n\"Lando Norris is doing brilliant laps,\" noted Sky F1's Ted Kravitz during commentary.\n\n\"It's been recognised by his pit crew. Sainz is starting to feel the pressure from behind.\"\n\nFinding himself in the lead when the last of the leaders, Piastri, pitted on lap 27, Norris then held the race lead for real three laps later when he was able to duck into the pits under the Safety Car after Sargeant had hit the barriers at Turn Three in the wake of a clash with Haas' Kevin Magnussen.\n\nIn a further boost, the Safety Car had arrived on track in front of second-placed Verstappen, meaning the net gap between Norris and his chief rival only grew on the McLaren's lap to the pits with the Red Bull running to the further-reduced speed of the Safety Car.\n\nA slick service from the McLaren crew got Norris back out ahead, and although Verstappen initially challenged him on the first corners of the restart, a small error from the Dutchman gave the Briton the space he needed and he was able to move more than one second clear by the time DRS was enabled.\n\nNorris, in supreme form in his upgraded car, never looked back as he surged to his maiden F1 triumph.\n\nLando Norris, McLaren - 1st: \"I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it altogether.\n\n\"This is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and do believe in them. Today we proved exactly that.\"\n\nMax Verstappen, Red Bull - 2nd: \"Once they switched onto the hard tyre, they just had more pace, and especially Lando, he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint, but if a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\n\n\"I mean understeer, oversteer, just very low grip on four wheels, and that's something that we have to understand.\"\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari - 3rd: \"We did our best but the timing of the Safety Car wasn't great for us and we had the oldest tyres.\n\n\"But we managed everything quite well and P3 was the best we could do and we are satisfied with that.\"\n\nFormula 1 heads to Europe as Imola returns to the calendar following last year's cancelled race.

Verstappen pitted two laps later, and rejoined 10 seconds behind Norris.\n\nBut despite having fresher tyres, Verstappen did not close on Norris - in fact the McLaren started to pull away.\n\nAnd when the safety car was deployed Norris had a sufficient advantage to pit and come out still in the lead.\n\nThere was bit of confusion when the safety car picked up Verstappen rather than Norris and the field had to be let past to run around and catch up behind Norris, but now it came down to a straight fight between the McLaren and the Red Bull.\n\nUsually, Verstappen would have been expected to pass Norris, and the Briton made it difficult for himself with a nervy restart which gave Verstappen the chance to think about a pass at Turn One at the restart.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/4a59/live/07af72e0-0b2c-11ef-a94f-d9833abc615e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one.

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organisation its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021.\n\nIt also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realised the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bear hug.\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone on to the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategise a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in yesterday's sprint race.", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors":

We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off,\" he added.\n\nThe nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021.\n\nVerstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday's race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line 7.6 seconds clear.\n\n\"Whooooooooooo, whooooooooo, I love you all,\" yelled Norris over the radio after becoming Britain's 21st Grand Prix winner. \"Thank you so much. We did it, Will (Joseph, Norris' race engineer). We did it.\n\n\"I guess that is how it is done. Finally. Oh, I am so happy. I knew it when I came in this morning. I said today is the day, full of opportunities. I nailed it, you nailed it, thank you so much.\n\n\"Thanks mum, thanks dad, this one is for my grandma, thank you very much.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\n\"I'm just really proud. A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way,\" Norris said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States - tying a record with Ferrari - but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race on Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning that he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"},

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bollard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8202/4101223_1_articlelarge_GettyImages-2151608955_1_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

F***! Sorry! What a race! It's been a long time coming. Finally, I've managed to do it.\n\n'I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. The whole weekend has been good.

Sky quickly apologised after the interview for Norris' hilarious x-rated outburst.\n\nBut it's been a long journey for the Miami GP winner to get to this point and one that is all the sweeter as Norris and McLaren finally broke Red Bull's early-season stranglehold on the championship.\n\nNorris became the youngest-ever British Formula One driver when he made his debut in the competition in 2019 at just 19-years-old at the Australian GP after coming through the ranks of the garage as an FP2 star.\n\nA now seasoned star on the Formula One circuit and McLaren's number one driver, Norris was a driver always destined to reach the heights of present day as he stood drenched in champagne on the Miami street track.\n\nStarring on the go-karting scene, Norris was talent-spotted by McLaren and impressed by always breaking records even as a youngster with him remaining the youngest driver ever to set a pole position at a national meeting.\n\nHe went on to become a paddock star while racing on go-karts - where many Formula One world champions like Michael Schumacher, Max Verstappen, and Lewis Hamilton first discovered their racing talent and Norris in-turn became the youngest karting world championship winner at 14, a title previously held by Hamilton.\n\nNorris is an avid sports lover away from the racetrack and indulges in a busy lifestyle\n\nNorris shares a close friendship with Red Bull's F1 reigning world champion Max Verstappen (left)\n\nNorris is amongst Formula One's most-popular drivers and promotes a luxury lifestyle on his social media accounts\n\nPhotography appears to be one of Norris' favourite hobbies during his spare time\n\nHis family, father Adam, mother Cisca, elder brother Oli, younger sisters Flo and another Cisca, live in Glastonbury, Somerset, and Norris has moved to Monaco where he now resides amongst the sport's elite.\n\nNorris previously shared a flat with French-Argentine racing driver Sacha Fenestraz in Guildford, Surrey, less than 10 miles from the McLaren factory in Woking, but has since moved abroad.\n\nMcLaren always wanted Norris to become a champion amongst their ranks and his rise from former reserve driver and F2 star to becoming the team's senior driver just last year shows their faith is paying off.\n\nTeam principal Zak Brown once called an even-more youthful Norris to his office in 2019 to tell him the news that he was being given a contract and full-time seat in Formula One, telling him at the time: 'Welcome to Formula One.'\n\nNorris and McLaren team principal Zak Brown (left) shared an emotional hug after his win\n\nNorris has quickly become a figurehead for McLaren to put their faith into as his Miami victory proves\n\nThe Englishman took the news calmly at the time and has taken to the on and off-track demands that being one of the world's biggest sporting celebrities brings with it.\n\nFormula One's media moguls have wrangled their product as being the glitzy and most glamorous event as their recent success in Miami showed and Norris is central to their image - and McLaren's.\n\nThe energetic and motor-obsessed babyface of the sport has never looked unnerved by driving for McLaren and settled quickly in the sport, making podiums along the way but always falling short until passing the chequered flag first on Sunday.\n\n110 starts for McLaren finally came to their best moment yet in the season's seventh race of the calendar and Norris can now look to soaking in the American sunshine while toasting a first glorious GP victory.\n\nNorris was given a huge hug by former team-mate Daniel Ricciardo after the race\n\nHis age and combined millionaire status make celebrations a grander affair with Norris renowned for occasions where even recently he got injured accidentally while playing around partying.\n\nA night out in Amsterdam, Holland ahead of the Miami event saw Norris sustain a gruesome facial injury and was pictured sporting a cut on his face while on board a boat in the Dutch capital, having seemingly revelled in the King's Day celebrations.\n\nImages quickly circulated on social media showing Norris, 24, with a bloodied bandage stretched across his face - although he appeared in good spirits.\n\nAny signs of pain born from that injury were quickly doused in champagne by Red Bull's, Verstappen and Ferrari driver Charles LeClerc on the podium as the three celebrate and toasted to their success.\n\nNorris' popularity amongst his fellow competitors was evident more than ever to see at the end of the race as he embraced several drivers with whom he has become close-friends with over the years of lining up on the track alongside one another.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell - who finished eighth overall in Miami - put his arm around Norris as the pair enjoyed a brief moment of friendly conversation together amidst the chaos of post-race procedures and celebrations.\n\nFormer McLaren team-mate and now-RB Formula One Team driver - Daniel Ricciardo - was also pictured looking delighted while sharing a lengthy hug with Norris in the pits.\n\nLando Norris was recently spotted with Margarida Corceiro at the Monte-Carlo Masters final\n\nNorris met with former United States president Donald Trump who is currently trying to rally support ahead of this year's election\n\nMarks of Norris' face injury suffered while partying in Amsterdam in the build-up to race weekend could be seen while he celebrated\n\nMcLaren chief, Brown, looked like a dad full of pride when he roughly grabbed Norris and hugged his star driver who has finally delivered grand prix success for the team with a stunning win against the odds.\n\nAway from the track and once he has had time to revel in celebrations Stateside, Norris will likely return to Monaco and try to settle back in his usual routine where he leads a sports-obsessed lifestyle aimed at bearing success.\n\nNorris' social media channels shows he is a lover of fast-growing sport Paddel and golf, where he strikes a unique fashion sense as he takes time away from racing.\n\nThe riches of his McLaren contract reward him with up to \u00a320million-a-year, while his ever-growing profile as a rising social media star - where he often collaborates in videos with celebrity YouTubers - brings further endorsements give him the luxuries you'd expect from a F1 superstar.\n\nLando Norris was first spotted with Corceiro in Monaco in May 2023 via social media\n\nBarcelona forward Felix had been dating Portuguese model and actress Corceiro since 2019\n\nMeanwhile, regular sightings alongside the ex-girlfriend of Barcelona footballer Joao Felix, Margarida Corceiro, only add to speculation and discussion about his romantic life.\n\nThe pair were recently spotted at the Monte-Carlo Masters final amid her split from Felix last year. Norris and Corceiro were first spotted together last May in a video on social media showing the 24-year-old driving his Fiat Jolly with her in the back of the classic car.\n\nNorris and his close-friend and Mercedes star George Russell shared a warm brief interaction after his win\n\nNorris had previously been dating Luisinha Oliveira, with the McLaren driver beginning a relationship with the Portuguese model at the start of 2022.\n\nThe relationship ended in September that year, with Norris confirming the split on social media.\n\nSupercars and designer watches are amongst his collection that will now have to make room for a GP winners trophy that Norris was brave enough to dangle in the air - not least surprising after he smashed a trophy last year.\n\nHis time in Formula One is still relatively only at it's beginning and while much has been discussed about Norris' wait for a first victory, much should also be expected from his future as the Brit begins to purr inline with McLaren's improvements that are making them more competitive with each and every passing race.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

It's been a long time coming, but finally I've managed to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I finally delivered for them. A long day, tough race, but finally on top, so I'm over the moon.\"\n\nNotably, McLaren brought an extreme set of top-to-tail upgrades to the Miami Grand Prix which they were putting to the test. These include reshaped bodywork, a new sidepod inlet, underfloor and front wing, revised suspension and front brake ducts.\n\n\"I knew on Friday we had the pace, just a couple of mistakes here and there, but today we managed to put it together,\" Norris said in post-race interviews.\n\n\"We put the perfect strategy [together], it all paid off. Thanks to McLaren, everyone, and I have to give a shout-out to my mum and dad of course.\"\n\nWith Norris's race pace and subsequent victory, it is clear these revisions have worked. He was the only McLaren driver to receive this upgrade, while teammate Oscar Piastri is set to have them for the next race at Imola.\n\nNorris did have a tricky start to the Grand Prix weekend, retiring on the first lap of the sprint race, but saw Sunday as a clean slate to hit the ground running. McLaren then gambled on a medium tyre for qualifying which gave him a respectable fifth place on the grid.\n\nAt lights out, Norris initially fell back a place during a chaotic start that saw the Ferraris ahead fight for position while Max Verstappen bolted off the line. With tensions rising with the Ferraris, the second Red Bull of Sergio P\u00e9rez locked up in the first corner, opening the door for Piastri to rise to third in the running.\n\nVerstappen was as strong as usual until a rare mistake from the world champion then played perfectly into McLaren's hands. The Dutchman struck a bollard, carrying it on his front wing before leaving it lying on the track, prompting a virtual safety car to be instituted while a marshall removed it from the tarmac. Verstappen was forced to pit, handing the lead to Piastri.\n\nA few laps later, Piastri and Carlos Sainz behind him pitted as well. The two could not have known that mere moments later, a full safety car would be deployed when an incident between Kevin Magnussen and hometown hero Logan Sargeant saw the Williams driver smacking into the Tecpro barrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Norris inherited the lead from his teammate's pitstop, and now with a safety car in his favour, he could pit under much better conditions with a smaller time loss, emerging from the pit lane still at the front of the field.\n\nFrom then on he only had to hold onto his lead and keep Verstappen's Red Bull firmly in his rearview mirrors.\n\nThe McLaren upgrades did their work, as Norris clocked in speedy lap times that edged the world champion out of DRS range and then gradually increased his lead. By the time the chequered flag flew, Norris was 7.5 seconds clear of the Red Bull.\n\nVerstappen, who is not used to finishing anywhere other than first place, had only praise for his friend and rival.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nNorris first stepped onto the podium in Austria in 2020 - his second year of racing for F1 - inheriting third place after Lewis Hamilton received a five-second penalty and subsequently dropped to fourth.\n\nHe next tasted podium bubbly in 2021 with four finishes in the top three, most notably in Monza, where McLaren took their first victory since 2012. That time, however, it was Norris's teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, on the top step after leading home a spectacular 1-2 result for McLaren.\n\nAt the very next race, in Sochi, Russia, it looked to be Norris's turn for the spotlight with his eyes on a first victory. The British driver was the fastest in damp conditions in qualifying, taking a surprise pole position.\n\nOn race day Norris looked strong, holding off Hamilton's Mercedes behind. On race day though, rain and tough decisions were his downfall, when unexpected showers prompted others to dive into the pits while he stayed out on slick tyres. Norris ultimately slid out in a heartbreaking moment that allowed Hamilton to take his 100th win. Norris ended in seventh place.\n\nAlmost three years passed before Norris had another real chance at a victory over the weekend in Miami. He has racked up his fair share of top-three finishes - but Formula 1's newest race winner says it was all worth it.\n\n\"It's incredible... It was an amazing feeling seeing everyone applauding and cheering. Seeing the whole team there, so happy - I've let them down a few times, but I think today makes up for every moment that we've had together, the ups and downs. Today overtakes everything by a country mile,\" Norris said.\n\nWith his first win now under his belt, any incoming trips to the podium are likely to also be in McLaren papaya colours for the foreseeable future. Norris has spent his Formula 1 career with the Woking-based team, first climbing into the papaya car for a full season in 2019.\n\nSince then he has remained dedicated to the British outfit, most recently committing to an extended multiyear contract that stretches beyond 2025.\n\n\"This reflects the commitment and confidence we have together, with our shared ambition to ultimately win championships again in the future,\" McLaren F1 team principal Andrea Stella said at the beginning of the year.\n\n\"[Norris] has grown as a driver and a person since initially joining McLaren [...] he impressed last season, playing an important role in our progress throughout the year, securing seven podiums with many fantastic drives.\"\n\n\"I've grown up with McLaren and feel at home here, the team are like family to me,\" Norris said about the contract announcement.\n\n\"The journey so far has been exciting, we've had ups and downs, but last season showed our desire to get back to competing at the front of the grid.\"\n\nAfter this first victory Norris told the media winning a race was \"something I've dreamed of doing for a long time\".\n\n\"A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together, so this is all for the team.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news",

McLaren's Norris beats Red Bull's Verstappen at the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix", "body": "A fortunately-timed crash involving a Fort Lauderdale driver. A three-time world champion suddenly looking like an impatient Miami driver on Interstate 95. An upgraded car helping a driver with zero grand prix wins end one of the most dominant driver runs in a sport of dominant runs.\n\nThat was Sunday's 2024 Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix, won by McLaren's Lando Norris at the Miami International Autodrome at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\n\nA gleeful Norris screamed ecstatic joy into his radio afterwards, then jumped into a crowd of the Team McLaren personnel. He had run 109 F1 races with eight second-place finishes before Sunday.\n\nSaid Norris, who started fifth: \"It's about time, huh? What a race! It's been a long time coming, but finally, I've been able to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I finally delivered for them.\"\n\nMcLaren presented Norris with an upgraded car this week, but even CEO Zak Brown said he thought the upgrades would just get the team close to Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez. But, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who finished third, saw a lap Norris turned on Friday and thought McLaren looked strong for the weekend.\n\n\"I said on Friday, it felt good. I was confident on Friday,\" Norris said. \"Today, that feeling came back to me. A lot of Sundays recently, I've been strong. Today, I stepped it up even more.\"\n\nAnd, Norris flat outran by 7.6 seconds Verstappen, who either DNFs (Did Not Finish) or wins these days, and Leclerc. Verstappen won 17 of the last 18 races last year, had won the four races he had finished this year and qualified on pole for all six races this season.\n\nThe last time Verstappen got outraced, he started 11th after problems during qualifying and finished fifth last year in Singapore, ending a 10-race winning streak. When he sounded unhappy after winning Saturday's F1 Sprint race from pole, most observers dismissed it as Verstappen being his grumpy self.\n\n\"I never felt comfortable all weekend with it,\" Verstappen said of his car. \"I think on the medium (tires) it was okayish, but on the hard, it was quite a disaster. Low grip, just very tricky balancing the low speed, I couldn't lean on the rear. While at the high speed, I was understeering a lot. When you have these two issues, you can't also balance it out because you're chasing two different things.\"\n\nStill, Sunday, he rolled along with about a three-second lead on Lap 22, when he jumped the Turn 15 curb and ran over the kind of orange post that separates the express lanes from the general lanes on I-95.\n\n\"I didn't like it, so I decided to take it out,\" Verstappen deadpanned afterwards. \"There was no damage. The cone was out of the way for everyone, so it was basically a free for all.\"\n\nRed Bull said there was damage to the car, but Verstappen said he felt no change.\n\nThat was Lap 22. Soon after, Verstappen pitted, leaving Norris in the lead as the last of the top runners to pit. Then, Norris got a \"when it's your day, it's your day\" break.\n\nOn the 28th lap, Fort Lauderdale's Logan Sargeant tangled with Kevin Magnussen in Turn 3. Magnussen got the 10-second penalty for causing a collision, and Sargeant was out of the race, 20th out of 20.\n\nBecause that brought a full course yellow flag and the field slowing behind a safety car, Norris was able to pit and retain the lead. On the restart, Verstappen tried to slide outside Norris, but Norris slid wide to protect. Verstappen soon found himself falling back to Leclerc.\n\nVerstappen said once he heard Norris' lap times on the harder compound tire, he figured the McLaren would be hard to catch.\n\n\"Even with that safety car, we still had all the opportunities to win today, but we were not quick enough after that safety car,\" Verstappen said. \"Once I realized that, I just settled in and tried to come home in second.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Norris said he knew he had new tires, clean air and figured he could hold off Verstappen.\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald.

McLaren have been to rock bottom and back since Lewis Hamilton won their last world title back in 2008. The Woking team are starting to look seriously competitive once again.\"\n\nThe Sun's headline is: \"Gamble Land-ed.\" Its race report goes in with: \"LANDO NORRIS was the top Trump in the Miami Grand Prix after winning his first F1 GP. The brilliant Brit capitalised on a rare off day for the reigning world champion Max Verstappen to win this thriller at the Hard Rock Stadium.\"\n\nBild: He can be beaten!\n\nThe fact that a Grand Prix has not been won by Max Verstappen is the reason for a remarkable headline in the German Bild: 'Formel-1-Sieger is NICHT Verstappen', with the subtitle 'Big surprise in Miami'.\n\nThe race report then opens with the words: \"He's beatable! Max Verstappen wins the Miami Grand Prix - NOT!\" All this of course points to the continued dominance of Max Verstappen, which meant that few had expected a victory for anyone other than the Dutchman.\n\n\"Instead, Lando Norris surprisingly crosses the finish line first. Not only does he become the 114th driver in the history of the premier class of motorsport to win a race, he also avoids a negative record. If the Brit had stood on the podium for the 16th time in his career in Miami, he would have been the driver with the most grands prix between his first podium finish and his first victory. It didn't get that far.\"\n\nThe safety car really messed things up, as people in Germany also concluded: \"Verstappen had recently had his first tyre change and thus relinquished his (clear) lead. With the safety car, the McLaren driver gets a 'free pitstop'.\n\nThe Briton returns to the track ahead of Verstappen and retains the lead during the flying restart. The McLaren star, who had already been labelled as 'eternal talent' by some experts in the paddock, then drove sovereignly to victory.\"\n\nL'Equipe: A clear mistake\n\nIn France, the race report in the largest sports newspaper L'Equipe is headlined 'La surprise Norris'. Here too, the McLaren driver's victory was not expected.\n\n\"To beat Max Verstappen, you always need a bit of luck,\" the F1 reporter writes in the first paragraph.\n\n\"In Australia, Carlos Sainz and Ferrari benefited from the retirement of the three-time world champion. In Miami, Lando Norris scored his first ever F1 victory, thanks to a safety car at the wrong time for Verstappen.\"\n\nThis was the moment when everything fell in the right direction for the McLaren driver.\n\n\"By positioning itself in front of Max Verstappen's car and not in front of leader Norris, the safety car gave the team from Woking the opportunity to make a pit stop in peace and go out as the leader again. The safety car caught the entire field and slowed them down, especially Verstappen. An obvious mistake, but Norris was more than happy to unwrap the present. The Dutch giant still had to be defeated, but he did an excellent job.\"\n\nWith the usual grades, Norris was awarded a 9: \"Admittedly, the safety car made it a lot easier for him by coming in at the best time and not necessarily in the best place (which kept him in the lead despite his pitstop). But once in the lead, Lando Norris put on a show. Untouchable with his hard tyres, he needed nothing and no one to stay ahead of Max Verstappen, who was over seven seconds behind him.\"\n\nGazzetta dello Sport: Red Bull is not invincible\n\n'Finalmente Lando Norris!' opens the race report in the Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nIts report states: \"The usual winner Max Verstappen finished second this time, due to a car with which he was unable to attack the Englishman. Norris led the race due to a stroke of luck with the timing of the safety car. A touch of luck that does not detract from the merits of the 24-year-old British talent.\"\n\nHowever, people in Italy are also critical of the race management and the timing of the safety car, which meant that they did not catch leader Norris but pursuer Verstappen.\n\n\"Fortunately, this oversight by the FIA had no impact on the race. Norris had about 18 seconds ahead of Verstappen at the time of the neutralization, more than enough to make a pit stop under safety car conditions and maintain the lead. If the field had been closer together, this mistake could have been decisive.\"\n\nIn addition to the joy of a new race winner in the sport, people in Italy also draw another conclusion: \"This race has shown that Red Bull is not invincible. McLaren took a big step forward with the extensive package of updates. Ferrari will also provide updates during the next GP in Imola. Strange that this 'turnaround' took place during the first GP after Adrian Newey announced his departure from Red Bull. Coincidence?\", the author wonders.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Norris topped the timing sheets in both SQ1 and SQ2, but struggled in the third session on the softs, slipping down the order and qualifying in P9.\n\nHis F1 Sprint Race ended on the first turn Saturday, as he was washed out in a four-car incident that left his MCL38 with terminal damage.\n\nMcLaren was able to get his car ready for qualifying for the Miami Grand Prix later in the day, and Norris again showed decent pace, finishing that session in P5. But with Max Verstappen starting on pole position, it looked as if this Miami Grand Prix would end up like so many other races the past three-plus seasons, with the rest of the grid chasing down Verstappen in vain.\n\nBut that changed on Sunday.\n\nNorris was running in sixth through the early stages of the Miami Grand Prix, but as the laps ticked on, he continued to show tremendous pace. He posted what to that point was the fastest lap of the race on Lap 19, and was running near the front around the mid-way point of the race.\n\nThat's when Norris, who still needed to make his mandatory pit stop and tire switch, got the break he needed.\n\nA collision between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant spun the Williams driver into the barrier, eventually bringing out the safety car. That enabled Norris to pit under ideal conditions, and he came out on a set of hards in front of Verstappen. But with the Red Bull driver lurking, Norris needed to stick the restart and pull away from DRS range as quickly as possible to see the day through.\n\nHe did just that.\n\nOver the closing stages of the Miami Grand Prix Norris slowly built a lead, maintaining it into the final laps. As he was pulling away, Verstappen made it clear that he was not going to be able to chase down the McLaren in front of him. \"I can't get the car to turn,\" lamented Verstappen to his team in the pits. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nIt was anything but a disaster for the McLaren driver, who finally got to reach the top step for the first time in his F1 career.\n\n\"About time!\" exclaimed Norris after the race trackside to Jenson Button. \"What a race. It's been a long time coming, but finally I've managed to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I finally delivered for them. A long day, tough race, but finally on top so I'm over the moon.\n\n\"The whole weekend's been good, I've just had some little setbacks along the way,\" continued Norris. \"I knew on Friday we had the pace, just a couple of mistakes here and there, but today we managed to put it together. We put the perfect strategy [together], it all paid off. Thanks to McLaren, everyone, and have to give a shout out to my mum and dad of course.\"\n\nNorris was also asked about his team, who gave him his chance in racing. He did not hold back his gratitude.\n\n\"What do I say to them? I'm just proud really,\" Norris responded. \"A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them. Today proved exactly that.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_reduction_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag reduction system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenson Button"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mINS_vAuLKxEFfWTbngKGow5Ctw=/0x0:5707x2854/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25434743/2151621141.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\n\"I'm going to go all night,\" Norris promised of the post-race party. \"I may have more than a bandage on my nose.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nIt took him a few minutes of wiping his eyes clear before he slammed his own champagne bottle to the ground to force it into a heavy stream he used to soak his McLaren team below the podium. He also tossed the winning trophy into the air, but caught it.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Verstappen had been undefeated at Miami with wins in its first two races and the sprint race on Saturday.\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track Sunday morning that he'd end the day atop the podium.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nAs for his incident in the chicane, Verstappen tried to joke about it hitting the cone.\n\n\"I didn't like it. So I took it out,\" he said. \"And tested the front wing. So crash-test done.\"\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his fist in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Sargeant and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\n0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

I've had a few setbacks along the way. I knew on Friday we had the pace and just a couple of mistakes here and there but today we managed to put it together, we put the perfect strategy, it all paid off.\"\n\nIn addition to a bit of luck and timing, Norris' victory was based on genuine pace - he was the quickest car on track once he was released from behind the struggling Red Bull of Sergio Perez when the Mexican made an early pit stop for tyres on lap 17.\n\nFrom then until the safety car for a collision between Williams' Logan Sargeant and Haas driver Kevin Magnussen at Turn Three, Norris turned on the pace and set the foundations for his win.\n\nThe fact that this was not the usual cruise to victory for Verstappen was obvious when he missed the chicane on lap 21 and displaced a bollard. Red Bull said after the race it had damaged his floor and cost performance.\n\nThe virtual safety car had to be deployed for half a lap to clear the debris from the track. Verstappen pitted two laps later, and rejoined 10 seconds behind Norris.\n\nBut despite having fresher tyres, Verstappen did not close on Norris - in fact the McLaren started to pull away.\n\nAnd when the safety car was deployed Norris had a sufficient advantage to pit and come out still in the lead.\n\nThere was a bit of confusion when the safety car picked up Verstappen rather than Norris and the field had to be let past to run around and catch up behind Norris, but now it came down to a straight fight between the McLaren and the Red Bull.\n\nUsually, Verstappen would have been expected to pass Norris, and the Briton made it difficult for himself with a nervy restart which gave Verstappen the chance to think about a pass at Turn One.\n\nBut the combination of the pace of the upgraded McLaren and Verstappen struggling with a lack of front grip meant Norris was able to stretch away, turning the tables on Verstappen, on whom Norris inflicted the pain the Dutchman usually does on the rest of the field.\n\nIn doing so, and winning by nearly eight seconds, he became the first driver to beat Verstappen on track when he had finished the race since Ferrari's Carlos Sainz in Singapore in September last year.\n\nBehind them, Leclerc drove a strong race to stay within two seconds of Verstappen despite making his pit stop for tyres four laps before the Red Bull driver.\n\nHis team-mate Carlos Sainz finished fourth on the track, but lost that place after being penalised for colliding with McLaren's Oscar Piastri when passing the Australian with 17 laps to go.\n\nSainz had been angered by Piastri forcing him off the track when he passed the Ferrari at Turn 11 a few laps earlier, after which Sainz complained vociferously on the radio that he should be given the place back. But the stewards did not agree and felt Piastri had done nothing wrong.\n\nThe collision wrecked Piastri's front wing and he had to stop for it to be replaced. Sainz managed to get away with minimal damage but after the race the stewards penalised him five seconds, dropping him to fifth behind Perez.\n\nLewis Hamilton had an eventful race in his Mercedes, battling first with Nico Hulkenberg's Haas and then Yuki Tsunoda's RB to take sixth, just a second behind Perez, ahead of the Japanese and the second Mercedes of George Russell.\n\nAnd Fernando Alonso recovered from a poor qualifying in the Aston Martin - the Spaniard started only 15th - to take ninth place, passing the Alpine of Esteban Ocon, who took the final point for 10th place.\n\nRound seven of the Formula 1 season heads to Italy and the legendary Imola circuit, from 17-19 May.\n\nThe Emilia Romagna Grand Prix was added to the shortened calendar during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and was intended as a \"one-off\" event. It returned again in 2021 and 2022 but last year, the race weekend had to be cancelled because of major flooding in the region.\n\nWith 2024 marking 30 years since the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and three-time world champion Ayrton Senna during the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, tributes are expected to take place across the three days.\n\nOn race day, four-time F1 title winner Sebastian Vettel will be taking to the track to drive Senna's McLaren MP4/8 from 1993.", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

The win came in dominant fashion as Norris led for much of the second half of the race and cruised to the finish line several seconds ahead of the second-place Verstappen.\n\nAfter the third Miami Grand Prix, here's a look at the full rundown of Sunday's leaderboard:\n\nThe race was up for groups through the first 20 laps or so, but Norris and Verstappen created some distance from the rest of the group early in the second half of the race.\n\nNorris defended a push from Verstappen to remain the leader, and that attack was the last he would have to fight off as he won comfortably. Norris led by 4.9 seconds with 10 laps to go, and increased that lead to 5.9 seconds heading into the final five laps.\n\nHe was flawless in the final laps of the race and held on to get his first Grand Prix win.\n\nNorris started the race in fifth place but quickly climbed the leaderboard and showed pure dominance down the stretch. The win was a long time coming for the British driver and it seems he's on his way to an outstanding career.\n\nTaking down Verstappen, who won nine straight races earlier this year, is no easy task, but Norris did it with ease on Sunday and showed promise for his career ahead.\n\nAfter Norris finally notched his first Grand Prix win, fans praised the driver for his perseverance over the years.\n\nNorris has been close to his first win but could never take the top spot on the podium until Sunday.

"body": "Lando Norris earned his first Formula 1 victory, beating championship leader Max Verstappen at the Miami Grand Prix for McLaren's first win in three years.\n\nNorris shed his unwanted record for the most podiums without an F1 win in style, taking full advantage of a safety car, McLaren's new upgrade and some stellar driving along the way, to finally see the chequered flag first.\n\nA tardy start\n\nIt was the McLaren of Oscar Piastri who stole a march at the start, leaping his way from sixth to third as Sergio Perez misjudged his braking into Turn 1 and almost wiped out polesitting team-mate Verstappen.\n\nPiastri then passed Charles Leclerc into the Turn 17 left-hander while Norris dropped from fifth to sixth.\n\nThe picture out front remained largely static aside from Perez making an early switch to the hards on lap 17.\n\nFour laps later Verstappen made a rare error, skipping across the chicane and whacked the bollard out of place in the process.\n\nThat dislodged bollard warranted a virtual safety car but another incident would prove decisive....\n\nA gift for Norris\n\nNorris's pace when released by Perez put Verstappen, who Red Bull pitted two laps after his bollard incident, in something of a safety car danger zone window with a yet-to-stop Norris leading.\n\nAnd Verstappen's worst fear was realised when the safety car was deployed just after Norris crossed the line on lap 28.\n\nThe safety car was caused by yet another incident in Miami for Kevin Magnussen, who put his Haas down the inside of Logan Sargeant through Turns 2/3 and ended up tipping the Williams driver into a spin.\n\nThat allowed Norris to make his mandatory pitstop and come out still in the lead of the race while Verstappen was bottled up behind the safety car, which then released him.\n\nIt left Norris ahead of Verstappen on the safety car restart and a straight head-to-head fight for the second half of the race.\n\nNorris brings it home\n\nThe closest Verstappen got to overhauling Norris proved to be the restart where Norris didn't get the jump he'd have wanted and instead had to fend off Verstappen into Turn 1.\n\nBut thereafter Norris stretched his legs and built a comfortable leading margin over Verstappen.\n\nVerstappen was far from happy with the balance of his RB20 all weekend and that continued into the race.\n\nWhile Verstappen chased Norris he fumed: \"I can't get the car to turn, it's a disaster\".\n\nIt left Norris clear to take the victory that got away from him at the 2021 Russian Grand Prix in his 111th start in F1.\n\nFerrari third-best\n\nFerrari had to settle for third best in Miami with Charles Leclerc securing the final spot on the podium.\n\nTeam-mate Carlos Sainz survived a skirmish with Piastri to take fourth but the latter picked up front wing damage that had to be replaced.\n\nThat ruined any chance of points for Piastri and Perez instead picked up fifth ahead of Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes.\n\nRB's Yuki Tsunoda was another to benefit from the safety car but like Norris, he put himself in that position with a stellar opening stint.\n\nTsunoda took seventh ahead of the second Mercedes of George Russell, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon who picked up Alpine's first point of an otherwise miserable 2024 season so far.", "source": {"uri": "the-race.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Race"},

What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\n\n\"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\"\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the grand prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over his Perez.\n\nMercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso grabbed ninth while Esteban Ocon earned struggling Alpine their first point of the season crossing 10th.\n\nStarting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car.\n\nVerstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead.\n\nWith the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break.\n\nWilliams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right?\n\n\"Today was just a bit tricky. If a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/lando-norris-062755316-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=NVcuij.UykRMpldz.kH3cD1N07VoVDHq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

It's been a long time coming but finally I was able to manage to do it and I'm so happy for my whole team. Long day, tough race but I'm finally on top, so I'm over the moon.\"\n\nAfter taking the lead from Verstappen on a series of pit stops during a mid-race full course caution period, Norris easily pulled away from the two-time defending race winner -- ultimately extending his advantage to a 7.612-second victory. Scuderia Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished third -- his second podium in the three Miami races.\n\nCarlos Sainz and Sergio Perez rounded out the top five.\n\nVerstappen won four of the previous five races this season, having to retire early with mechanical issues in Australia. But Sunday, Norris just outpaced the reigning three-time series champion, who at one point radioed to his Oracle Red Bull team, \"I can't get the car to turn, it's a disaster.\"\n\nNorris' win broke Verstappen's six-race winning streak in the U.S. Verstappen failed to win in the Miami Grand Prix for the first time in its three races.\n\nPost-race, Verstappen -- who started from pole position and won the Miami Sprint Race on Saturday -- was full of perspective and the first to congratulate Norris after climbing out of his car.\n\n\"Once we switched up to the hard tire, they just had more pace, especially Lando, he was just flying,\" Verstappen said. \"... If a bad day is P2, I'll take it, right? I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming.\"\n\nNorris' previous 15 career podium finishes without a win were the most in the series. He'd competed in 109 previous F1 races without a win, and this was only the second win for McLaren in the last decade -- all of these factors only contributing to Norris' elation.\n\n\"What a drive,\" McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown said, still smiling. \"Gotta thank everyone back at McLaren and here, all the hard work p", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/daxekw/picture288335405/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Lando.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I'll take it right?\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, its been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nLeclerc echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"Very often he ran very close it but for one reason or another he didn't make it. But today he did an incredible job and the whole weekend he has been on it,\" said the Ferrari driver.\n\nSainz finished fourth with Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in fifth place but the pair swapped places after stewards imposed a post-race penalty of five seconds on the Spaniard for his collision with Piastri.\n\nMercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished sixth and eighth with RB's Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda ending seventh.\n\nAs in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities.\n\nFormer France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race.

He would run 109 F1 races with eight second-place finishes before Sunday.\n\nMcLaren presented Norris with an upgraded car this week, but even CEO Zak Brown said he thought it would just get the team close to Red Bull's Verstappen and Sergio Perez.\n\nSaid Norris, who started fifth: \"It's about time, huh? What a race! It's been a long time coming, but finally, I've been able to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I finally delivered for them.\"\n\nAnd, Norris flat outran Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who either DNFs (Did Not Finish) or wins during the past two seasons, and the third-place Ferrari of Charles Leclerc. Verstappen won 19 of 23 races last year, and had won the four races he had finished this year and qualified on pole for all six races this season.\n\nBut, Verstappen never seemed comfortable this weekend. Sunday, in Turn 15, he jumped the curb and ran over the kind of orange post that separates the express lanes from the general lanes on I-95.\n\n\"Yeah, I hit that cone in 15 -- check the front wing,\" Verstappen said on the radio.\n\nThat was Lap 22. Soon after, Verstappen pitted, leaving Norris in the lead as the last of the top runners to pit. Then, Norris got a break when, on the 28th lap, Fort Lauderdale's Logan Sargeant tangled with Kevin Magnussen. Turn 3. Magnussen got the 10-second penalty for causing a collision, but Sargeant was out of the race, 20th out of 20.\n\nBecause that brought a full course yellow flag, Norris was able to pit and retain the lead. On the restart, Verstappen tried to slide outside Norris, but Norris slide wide to protect. Verstappen soon found himself falling back to LeClerc.\n\nVerstappen said once he heard Norris' lap times on the harder compound tire, he figured the McLaren would be hard to catch.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_neal@miamiherald.com", "name": "David J.

The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\n\"I'm just really proud. A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way,\" Norris said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. Ricciardo was among the handful of drivers who found Norris for a congratulatory hug following the race.\n\nNorris is the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe song seemed to affect Norris, who closed his eyes as he turned his head to the sky with a huge grin on his face. When it came time for the champagne celebration, he was doused by runner-up Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc, who sprayed the champagne directly into Norris' eyes.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6 seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull. Ferrari drivers Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. finished third and fourth and were followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.

A competitive race saw Norris capitalise on Verstappen's troubles for victory. At the finishing line, Verstappen was quick to react to Norris' first-ever win, acknowledging him by giving him an applause.\n\nLando Norris ended the wait for his first-ever F1 race win, having come first in the Miami Grand Prix with a comfortable seven-second lead on second placed Max Verstappen.\n\nIt was a nerve-wracking last 10 laps for the Brit, who looked to finally claim a victory in his 110th race, and in doing so it was clear that it wasn't just McLaren fans rooting for Norris, as many drivers could be seen applauding him as they made their way over the finish line, most notably Max Verstappen.\n\nMiami Grand Prix Report It was a race to remember for McLaren's Lando Norris\n\nThe sixth race of the F1 season emanated from a very sunny Miami, where Max Verstappen was the odds-on favourite to win. No surprise there. Having already won four of the five races before Miami, racing fans have become accustomed to accepting the Dutchman is most likely to win, which is why moments like Carlos Sainz Jr's win in Australia are such big deals, although a DNF from the reigning champion did aid the Spaniard there.\n\nClose\n\nHowever, this time round, there were no excuses, as a very competitive race took place. The current F1 World Drivers' Champion, Verstappen, instantly flew away from the pack and looked to dominate the whole race from first, but that wasn't to be the case as his own Red Bull teammate, Sergio Perez, almost took him out on the opening lap, something that opened the race up.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: The Miami GP was Lando Norris' 110th start in a Formula 1 race.\n\nThe race then took another twist as Verstappen collided with a bollard, which led to a Safety Car intervention, and the race started to open up again. With Lando Norris not having pitted yet, he bided his time and went at the opportune moment, ensuring he benefited from Verstappen's self-proclaimed \"disaster\" car, and a crash between Logan Sargeant and Kevin Magnussen.\n\nRelated Miami Grand Prix Food Prices The cost of food at the Miami Grand Prix has gone viral after an image was posted online of the menu.\n\nLando had now recorded his fastest laps and saw his five-second lead on Verstappen turn into a seven-second lead in the final 10 laps, as the Brit secured his first-ever race win. Much to the delight of McLaren fans around the world, it was also evident just how beloved Norris is by the other drivers, as a very classy moment took place in the closing stages of the Miami GP.\n\nVerstappen & Hamilton React to Norris' Win Both drivers were seen applauding the Brit straight after the race\n\nFootage from inside Verstappen's Red Bull car showed the Dutch driver applauding at the cockpit where Norris was, signalling a huge moment of respect between someone who has experienced the joy of victory many times before. There is also footage of Lewis Hamilton doing the same thing, in what is another validating moment of respect for Norris, having a fellow Brit and the most successful F1 driver reach out and show love.\n\nIt speaks volumes to the respect these drivers have for one another, that in a moment where professional pride can bubble onto the surface, they put their pride aside to applaud a first-time winner in Lando Norris.\n\nWith the Miami GP marking the quarter mark of the F1 season, Verstappen still leads the standings with an impressive 136 points, 35 points ahead of second-placed Perez. For Lando, this victory has taken him up to fifth in the standings and with a trip to Italy next, the Brit will be hoping he continues this good form in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_lap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastest lap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-08-09-am-4210.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

WOOOOOOOOO! About f -- ing time!\" on the team radio.\n\n\"I guess that's how it's done. Finally! Finally! I'm so happy. I knew it when I came in this morning, I said today is the day of opportunity and I nailed it, and you nailed it.\"\n\nIt was a popular result, demonstrated by the fact most drivers congratulated Norris on either his victory lap back to the pits or once he had climbed out of his car.\n\nAfter the race Norris said: \"About time, huh? What a race, it's been a long time coming and finally I've managed to do it -- so I'm so happy for my whole team, I've finally delivered for them. A long day, tough race but finally on top so I'm over the moon.\n\n\"I am, [proud] the whole weekend has been good, we had some little set backs along the way. I knew on Friday we had the pace, and just a couple of mistakes here and there. But today we managed to put it together, we put the perfect strategy and it all paid off. Thanks to McLaren and everyone, I have to give a particular shout to to my mum and dad.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to give a message to the team, he said: \"I'm just proud really, a lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together, so this is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nFernando Alonso and former teammate Daniel Ricciardo were among the drivers who found Norris before the podium ceremony to congratulate him.\n\nVerstappen said on his second place: \"I mean, you win, you lose, we're all used to that in racing. Today was just a bit tricky. I think today on the mediums it didn't feel fantastic, we were pulling away but not like it should be and then once we made a pit stop. I heard what time the lap times the McLarens were doing and I was like 'yeah that's pretty quick'. Once they [McLaren] switched over to the hard tyre they were pretty quick, especially Lando, he was flying.\n\n\"If a bad day is P2, then I take it. I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming. This isn't going to be his last one, he deserves it definitely.\"\n\nComing into Miami, Norris held the unenviable record of the most podium finishes (15) without a victory, although he consigned that to the history books.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc finished third ahead of teammate Carlos Sainz, while Red Bull's Sergio Perez was fifth.\n\nLewis Hamilton, who joined the plaudits for Norris after the race, finished sixth ahead of RB's Yuki Tsunoda and George Russell.\n\nFernando Alonso finished ninth, while Esteban Ocon grabbed a memorable point for the Alpine.\n\nThe race appeared to be settling into a familiar rhythm, with Verstappen leading -- although he was unable to shake the chasing pack as he has at other events this year.\n\nEverything changed shortly after Verstappen's first pit-stop of the race when Magnussen tried an opportunistic move on Sargeant, putting both into the wall.\n\nNorris, who had not yet made his first stop, effectively was able to change tyres without losing the same amount of time he would have normally.\n\nThe British driver resisted an aggressive attack from Verstappen at the restart but it was the closest the Red Bull would be to his car again, with Norris able to pull away over the second half of the race and win by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe nerves were clear at McLaren.\n\nIn the final laps, teammate Oscar Piastri was fighting closely with RB's Ricciardo and almost came to blows with his former teammate at one stage.\n\nHis race engineer then told Piastri: \"Oscar, reminder, Lando is winning the race, we do not want to cause a Safety Car here...\"\n\nPiasti might well have joined Norris on the podium were it not for a collision with Sainz earlier in the race which forced him into an unscheduled stop for a new front wing.\n\nVerstappen leads the drivers' championship by 35 points, with 136, as Norris moves up to fifth with 83 points.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors":

It was the first time Verstappen had been beaten on track when he finished the race, since Ferrari's Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year.\n\nNorris came into Miami having had a record 15 podium finishes without a win, with eight of those second-place finishes.\n\nNear-misses, such as at Sochi in 2021 when he led late but paid the price for failing to switch tyres in time during heavy rain, led to some taunting of Norris including the online nickname 'Lando NoWins'\n\nWhile he was all smiles after his victory, he was not going to miss the chance for a defiant reply to his critics.\n\n\"I am happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong,\" he told his post-race press conference. \"I love it to go on Instagram and like all the comments from people abusing me, I freaking love it, makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando NoWins', that's become the thing.\n\n\"For me to prove those people wrong and prove (to) the people who didn't think I could go out and do it, it's going to be an even bigger smile on my face today, so I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris insisted that he had always had faith in his ability to win a Grand Prix and asked if it was a weight off his shoulders to finally clinch one, he couldn't deny the reality.\n\n\"As much as I want to say no, it's a yes. To get that first victory is always incredible. I've of course had my moments where I've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win,\" he said.\n\n\"But I wasn't worried. As much as a lot of people doubted that I was going to be able to put it together and win a race, I wasn't worried.\"\n\nNorris said he was able to find time to savour the moment when he finally broke through.\n\n\"I dream of these days sometimes. You never know when they're going to come towards you, but today was that day,\" he said. \"As much as my mind was going crazy, I was thinking a lot of things, I was also quiet. It's just a bit lonely out there at times and it's nice to reflect on everything you've done to get to this point.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/34WGQMNBSAHFZQWTLDWR6XQEGE.jpg?smart=true&auth=d06f2df9d4c73ad83c42311f98e42999096e83399b38fc5ab6725a5304d82ac4&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Granted, his Mercedes is a rather false reflection of his overall ability, evidenced by team-mate George Russell's struggles down in eighth.\n\nYet, this is a reminder that while Hamilton will not be getting any better in his ageing years - even if his 2025 Ferrari fires him up the grid - the likes of Norris will certainly be getting faster as they approach their prime, and now with race-winning experience. Britain has a new grand prix hero.\n\n\"Stop the count!\" There was no need for McLaren to jokingly tweet Donald Trump's infamous quote after the former American president visited their garage at the Miami GP, because their lead proved to be more than just fleeting.\n\nIn warm sunshine in Miami, the F1 world championship finally heated up as Lando Norris secured victory..\n\nAnd the best part of it all was the fact that Norris deserved the victory, there was no mechanical failure from the Red Bull to hand him the win.\n\nLando is now a race winner, but more importantly for fans of F1 this season, Max is not a race winner this weekend.\n\nA scorching Miami Sunday which started with a British winner and a McLaren on the podium in the F1 Academy race ended the same way in the F1 feature race - except this time round, the two were one and the same.\n\nLando Norris may have been a touch fortunate to have still been awaiting his pitstop when the safety car was brought out, but it's worth remembering that it's only thanks to his fantastic effort in blasting out times on his ageing medium tyres that he was able to take that rare opportunity.\n\nContinuity is an underrated commodity in Formula 1, but this McLaren team are set to have it for years to come. They have a young sprint race winner in Oscar Piastri and now a young feature race winner in Norris.\n\nFor all the hype and hoopla about Lewis Hamilton going to Ferrari and Mercedes looking to fight back in 2026, McLaren could well be the juggernaut of the future.\n\nTyler Rowlinson - F1 Journalist\n\nOne may be biased here, as a McLaren fan myself, but this is the day F1 fans have been waiting for!\n\nIt was never a case of whether Lando Norris would win a race, it was a matter of when. He has always had the ability to challenge for victory and, admittedly it has taken longer than anticipated, but now he's finally got one, surely there will be many more to come.\n\nThe safety car certainly played into the McLaren's hands, but even so, the team kept Verstappen honest and didn't allow him to pull away. Was it the tyres and the lack of grip that was the reason the unstoppable force of the Dutchman and Red Bull weren't their usual self? Whatever the case, McLaren's upgrades have proven today that they are the team that can challenge the defending champions.\n\nWe saw a more inspired and fiery Lewis Hamilton in Miami, as he kept close to Sergio Perez towards the end of the race, proving that he can stay competitive when the Mercedes machinery decides to not be so Mercedes-y.\n\nAlpine deserve an honourable mention this weekend. It's clear to see they have taken a huge leap forward since the opening round in Bahrain. It may just be the one point, but it's one point more than what they had before this race. Good signs of progress from the French team.\n\nOverall, for a track that is difficult to pass on and has produced some dull races in the past, the 2024 edition was a very enjoyable race in Miami.\n\nLando Norris, finally, you're a Formula 1 race winner!\n\nRhys Thomas - F1 Journalist\n\nI didn't imagine there'd be any point this season at which I'd be hoping Max Verstappen would pick up the pace.\n\nBut as Lando Norris extended his lead from three seconds, to four, then past five, part of me was cursing the one time the Dutchman seemed out of tune with his Red Bull.\n\nOf course, any non-Verstappen win is a cause to uncork the champagne, but the excitement of the moment fizzled out rather than fizzing up.\n\nF1 is all about jeopardy and even surprise wins can suffer through a lack of it - Carlos Sainz's win in Australia was largely as pedestrian as any Verstappen one.\n\nThat said, this race was different from the start, with action and incident all over the track.\n\nPerhaps it's a shame this didn't extend into the battle for first; perhaps the storyline didn't need that extra drama.\n\nThe fact that the end of the race saw a driver pulling further and further away from his rivals, and that driver wasn't Max Verstappen just shows what an incredible job the young Brit managed.\n\nYes he and his team were fortunate with the safety that allowed them to get a jump on the Ferraris and Verstappen, but what came next was phenomenal.\n\nNorris dominated the field after the safety car period, and the usually dominant Dutchman could not get near to the pace of the 24-year-old.\n\nA well deserved victory for McLaren, and one which will be celebrated throughout Britain as fans wake up on a Bank Holiday Monday revelling in a new motorsport star.\n\nJim Kimberley - F1 Journalist\n\nThis time last year we had one of the dullest F1 races. Not even a yellow flag troubled the Miami International Autodrome as the glitz and glamour of Liberty Media's hope for an American Monaco-esque event fell flat. Today was the opposite.\n\nFrom the very first corner where Perez was 2cm from destroying Verstappen's race, we had drama. It continued as the Alpines battled. And before we knew it, the best race of 2024 unfolded.\n\nNorris is an F1 race winner and looked every bit of the champion material that many have said he is. Yes, he enjoyed the benefits of a safety car, but fortune is all part of F1. Let's not forget how unfortunate he has been in Miami before. Karma works in mysterious ways.\n\nTake a moment to think of Piastri today, though. He was the McLaren who surged forward at Turn 1 and raced up to P2. He was the one that could've jumped up to P1 had the VSC appeared earlier or later. To end up with no podium... no points... must hurt. Yet that also says McLaren are returning back to the sharp end. What a potent pairing.

Norris comprehensively beat the triple world champion Max Verstappen into second place to take the flag for the first time after 110 race starts since making his debut in Australia in 2019.\n\nNorris has come close to a win since then, not least at the 2021 Russian GP where he was denied a likely victory only by the intervention of rain late in the race. But the 24-year-old has faced detractors and abuse online questioning his ability and whether he could beat Verstappen in a straight fight, including social media posts referring to him as \"Lando No-wins\". Norris responded definitively in Miami and insisted he had found the feedback an entertaining spur to push him on to greater things.\n\n\"I never lost faith, I never didn't believe in what I could go out and do,\" Norris said. \"So happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong, because as much as I love to see it and I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me, I freaking love it, it makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando No-wins'.\n\n\"For me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face today. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris benefited from a free pit stop under the safety car that ensured he held the lead over Red Bull's Verstappen andwhile having fresher tyres. From that moment on he not only outraced Verstappen but showed nerves of steel to maintain and extend his lead over the Dutchman to close out with a comfortable advantage of 7.6 seconds at the flag.\n\nSuch has been Verstappen's dominance over the last two years that at the post-race press conference he inadvertently sat in the middle seat reserved for the winner and laughed when reminded that for once he had not been the victor. The defending world champion went on to pay tribute to Norris, with whom he is good friends.\n\n\"I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today,\" Verstappen said. \"He definitely deserved it. He was just miles faster at the end there. It's great, winning your first race is always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards Formula One, and then you dream of being on the podium but then being on the top step.\"\n\nNorris had 24 laps to maintain his lead, which he did with absolute control, putting in a series of fastest laps to comfortably see off Verstappen by the flag for a memorable and long-awaited victory. He paid tribute to the support he had received from his mother and father and explained why he had dedicated the win to his grandmother.\n\n\"My parents have been so supportive, they're the ones who are with you from the start,\" Norris said. \"They allowed everything to happen. They're the ones that got me into racing, supported me, and allowed me to get to Formula One, reach my dream, and do what I've loved to do since I was a kid.\n\n\"My grandma, because she's not been so well lately. I saw her last week and I told her that I was going to win a race. I didn't say when, I just said I was going to win a race. I didn't think it would be coming this soon, so I'm just very happy that I was able to do it as quickly as I did.\"\n\nAn emotional Norris was welcomed with joy by his team as he climbed from his car after securing McLaren their first win since the Italian GP at Monza in 2021, with the raft of upgrades made to the car proving to have brought real improvements.\n\nIt was all the more impressive given they had expected to struggle in Miami with the preponderance of slow corners not to their car's strengths. This was very much a win against the odds and suggests they are in contention as the second best team on the grid, perhaps surpassing Ferrari, while Norris has cemented his place among the top flight of drivers.\n\n\"A lot of people doubted that I could go out and win races and perform under the pressure of leading the race, especially with Max behind you, but really this year I felt more confident than ever,\" Norris said. \"I'm doing a good job.

I guess people doubted me along the way, and I have made mistakes over the last five years, in my short career, but I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris was a popular winner, with Lewis Hamilton, who finished sixth, slowing down on his in-lap before taking both hands off the steering wheel to congratulate his countryman.\n\n\"Lando was flying,\" said Verstappen after he finished 7.6 seconds behind Norris. \"I am very happy for him.

Prior to the weekend's Miami Grand Prix, he had started 109 F1 races and won a grand total of zero.\n\nAt the 110th attempt, Norris finally delivered on the promise he has shown for years. And, after he held off Max Verstappen in the mighty Red Bull to do it, F1 could not have had a more popular race-winner than the McLaren star.\n\nVerstappen led the congratulations from his rivals as, one after another, they all sought Norris out to give him a huge hug. And millions more across Britain and around the globe who have been charmed by the 24-year-old would have wanted to do the same.\n\nDespite his young age, Norris has been a mainstay on the F1 grid for years now. Aged just 19, he was signed by McLaren and became Britain's youngest ever F1 driver having impressed in the junior categories - and it didn't take him long to settle in.\n\nA maiden podium came in the very first race of his second season in the sport, at the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix. Fourteen more have followed since, as Norris equalled the all time record for the most podium finishes without having the experience of standing on the top step.\n\nBut he finally shook off his 'always the bridesmaid' moniker with a stellar driver in front of Hollywood stars in Miami. And, as his racing career finally begins to live up to the promise it has shown for years now, his personal life has become equally impressive.\n\nMcLaren's celebrations began after the race\n\nNorris boasts a huge income thanks to a mega-money contract signed earlier this year. McLaren, in a bid to ward off interest from rivals Red Bull, tied the Brit down to a four-year deal worth \u00a380million which ensures he is well compensated for his talent and the risk he takes every time he is strapped into the cockpit of his 1,000 horsepower racing machine.\n\nNorris has always managed to live a comfortable life thanks to his father Adam's career as a successful businessman which means he has a nine-figure fortune. Norris grew up with his father and Belgian mother Cisca in Glastonbury, Somerset, and went to a local school - but didn't get any qualifications as he focused on his racing.\n\nHis McLaren salary alone would be more than enough for a life of luxury but, on top of his F1 career, Norris has become a successful businessman in his own right. In November 2020, he launched his own gaming and lifestyle brand Quadrant which has become huge among his army of global fans.\n\nNorris is rumoured to be dating model Margarida Corceiro Corceiro previously dated footballer Joao Felix\n\nHe owns a \u00a320m Surrey mansion but, like most F1 drivers, spends most of the time that he is not on the road living in Monaco. And for years now there has also been plenty of speculation about his love life.\n\nNorris dated Portuguese model Luisinha Oliveira from the start of 2022 but, later that year, he confirmed on social media that the relationship had ended. These days, he has been spotted cosying up to Margarida Corceiro, also a Portuguese model.\n\nShe is the ex-girlfriend of former Chelsea footballer Joao Felix, who now plays for Barcelona. A relationship with Norris is not confirmed, but they have been spotted together plenty of times including recently at the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament.\n\nThe one thing that was missing from Norris' life was a trophy for winning an F1 race. At the end of last year he was increasingly frustrated over the wait, especially after a run of podium finishes - no matter how well he drove, Verstappen and Red Bull were simply too strong to beat.\n\nCorceiro, 21, is a Portuguese actress and model She boasts almost 1.9million followers on Instagram\n\nBut the opportunity arose in Miami and the 24-year-old grabbed it with both hands. The safety car came out at the right time for him and meant he was able to grab a cheap pit stop and still come out ahead of Verstappen, who had pitted a few laps earlier for fresh tyres.\n\nMany would have expected Verstappen to roar past the McLaren once the race resumed. But the team had armed Norris with a hugely upgraded car which gave him the pace he needed not only to fend off the Dutchman, but to pull away and win the race by more than seven seconds.\n\nVerstappen is not used to being beaten in a straight fight, but was the first to congratulate Norris, who he has previously described as his best friend in the F1 paddock. The Red Bull racer gave his rival a huge hug before saying: \"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last one so yeah, he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nMax Verstappen was quick to congratulate Norris for his win\n\nThere were also hugs and words of congratulations from the the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Daniel Ricciardo. And McLaren chief executive Zak Brown cancelled Norris' flight home and rebooked him onto another plane the following day, so that he could party the night away with his colleagues in Florida.\n\nHis father Adam, so often at the track to watch his boy in action, had not made the trip. He spoke to Sky Sports live from the family home in Somerset, struggling to hold back his emotions having watched young Lando finally achieve his boyhood dream.\n\nAs for Norris, he will hope it is the first victory of many and, aged 24, time is very much on his side. His achievement in Miami will also serve as a confidence boost for the rest of the F1 grid - Verstappen and Red Bull have dominated the sport for so long now, but Norris proved once and for all that they are not invincible.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author",

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Prior to the weekend's Miami Grand Prix, he had started 109 F1 races and won a grand total of zero.\n\nAt the 110th attempt, Norris finally delivered on the promise he has shown for years. And, after he held off Max Verstappen in the mighty Red Bull to do it, F1 could not have had a more popular race-winner than the McLaren star.\n\nVerstappen led the congratulations from his rivals as, one after another, they all sought Norris out to give him a huge hug. And millions more across Britain and around the globe who have been charmed by the 24-year-old would have wanted to do the same.\n\nDespite his young age, Norris has been a mainstay on the F1 grid for years now. Aged just 19, he was signed by McLaren and became Britain's youngest ever F1 driver having impressed in the junior categories - and it didn't take him long to settle in.\n\nA maiden podium came in the very first race of his second season in the sport, at the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix. Fourteen more have followed since, as Norris equalled the all time record for the most podium finishes without having the experience of standing on the top step.\n\nBut he finally shook off his 'always the bridesmaid' moniker with a stellar driver in front of Hollywood stars in Miami. And, as his racing career finally begins to live up to the promise it has shown for years now, his personal life has become equally impressive.\n\nNorris boasts a huge income thanks to a mega-money contract signed earlier this year. McLaren, in a bid to ward off interest from rivals Red Bull, tied the Brit down to a four-year deal worth \u00a380million which ensures he is well compensated for his talent and the risk he takes every time he is strapped into the cockpit of his 1,000 horsepower racing machine.\n\nNorris has always managed to live a comfortable life thanks to his father Adam's career as a successful businessman which means he has a nine-figure fortune. Norris grew up with his father and Belgian mother Cisca in Glastonbury, Somerset, and went to a local school - but didn't get any qualifications as he focused on his racing.\n\nHis McLaren salary alone would be more than enough for a life of luxury but, on top of his F1 career, Norris has become a successful businessman in his own right. In November 2020, he launched his own gaming and lifestyle brand Quadrant which has become huge among his army of global fans.\n\nHe owns a \u00a320m Surrey mansion but, like most F1 drivers, spends most of the time that he is not on the road living in Monaco. And for years now there has also been plenty of speculation about his love life.\n\nNorris dated Portuguese model Luisinha Oliveira from the start of 2022 but, later that year, he confirmed on social media that the relationship had ended. These days, he has been spotted cosying up to Margarida Corceiro, also a Portuguese model.\n\nShe is the ex-girlfriend of former Chelsea footballer Joao Felix, who now plays for Barcelona. A relationship with Norris is not confirmed, but they have been spotted together plenty of times including recently at the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament.\n\nThe one thing that was missing from Norris' life was a trophy for winning an F1 race. At the end of last year he was increasingly frustrated over the wait, especially after a run of podium finishes - no matter how well he drove, Verstappen and Red Bull were simply too strong to beat.\n\nBut the opportunity arose in Miami and the 24-year-old grabbed it with both hands. The safety car came out at the right time for him and meant he was able to grab a cheap pit stop and still come out ahead of Verstappen, who had pitted a few laps earlier for fresh tyres.\n\nMany would have expected Verstappen to roar past the McLaren once the race resumed. But the team had armed Norris with a hugely upgraded car which gave him the pace he needed not only to fend off the Dutchman, but to pull away and win the race by more than seven seconds.\n\nVerstappen is not used to being beaten in a straight fight, but was the first to congratulate Norris, who he has previously described as his best friend in the F1 paddock. The Red Bull racer gave his rival a huge hug before saying: \"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last one so yeah, he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nThere were also hugs and words of congratulations from the the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Daniel Ricciardo. And McLaren chief executive Zak Brown cancelled Norris' flight home and rebooked him onto another plane the following day, so that he could party the night away with his colleagues in Florida.\n\nHis father Adam, so often at the track to watch his boy in action, had not made the trip. He spoke to Sky Sports live from the family home in Somerset, struggling to hold back his emotions having watched young Lando finally achieve his boyhood dream.\n\nAs for Norris, he will hope it is the first victory of many and, aged 24, time is very much on his side. His achievement in Miami will also serve as a confidence boost for the rest of the F1 grid - Verstappen and Red Bull have dominated the sport for so long now, but Norris proved once and for all that they are not invincible.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type":

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nOn Lando Norris winning:\n\nDonald Trump was in the McLaren garage before the race, so will he take any credit for Lando's win? Here is with Lando after the race:\n\nOn his message for McLaren:\n\nYou beaty Lando! He comes home to win the Miami Grand Prix to take his first win in Formula One! The first of many!\n\nLando has just one lap remaining. You can do it Lando. He has over seven seconds on Verstappen.\n\nNorris is nearly seven seconds clear of Verstappen and he is getting closer and closer to his maiden win in F1. Keep going Lando!\n\nRicciardo is putting Albon under pressure for 15th and into turn 11 Albon locks up and goes way too deep, losing numerous places.\n\nPiastri has been told on his team radio that with Lando in the lead not to cause a safety car by taking too big a risk with an overtake.\n\nThere are just five laps remaining. Here are the current top five with gaps:\n\nA glimpse into the McLaren garage shows some nerves with Lando just over five laps away from a first win in F1. Come on Lando! Everyone is cheering on Lando and it will be such a popular win. Lando's lead over Verstappen is now over six seconds.\n\nThe stewards are going to investigate the incident between Sainz and Piastri after the race.\n\nNorris is just 10 laps away from his first win in F1. His lead over Verstappen is now over five seconds. This is a phenomenal performance from Lando.\n\nNorris is driving brilliantly in his quest for a first win in Formula One. He is now nearly four seconds ahead of Verstappen.\n\nThey have been fighting hard for the last few laps and Sainz gets past Piastri into turn 17. Sainz goes deep and there is a small amount of contact between Piastri's front wing and Sainz's rear wheel. Piastri gets back past Sainz with DRS down the main straight but Piastri goes deep so Sainz takes fourth back.\n\nPiastri has damage to the front wing and is overtaken by Perez and Hamilton into turn 11. Piastri is forced into the pits to change his front wing. As we are not long after the safety car, Piastri drops to the back. Such bad luck for Piastri.\n\nNorris is driving superbly here and sets a new fastest lap of the race. He is now two seconds ahead of Verstappen and has the advantage of younger tyres.\n\nBehind Sainz has been calling over the team radio for Piastri to give him the position after the battle at turn 11 but rightly so the stewards have decided no further investigation is necessary.\n\nSainz tries to go around the outside of Piastri at turn 11 but the Australian holds firm. Norris has got more than a second ahead of Verstappen so has crucially got out of the DRS range.\n\nWe are back racing. Norris stays ahead of Verstappen into turn one.\n\nInto turn 11 Leclerc looks like he is going for an audacious move up the inside of Verstappen but he pulls out as he is not close enough.\n\nK-Mag received plenty of penalties during the sprint yesterday and he now has a 10-second penalty for that crash with Sargeant.\n\nThe safety car is coming in at the end of this lap.\n\nThe safety car has come at a brilliant moment for Norris and McLaren as he comes in and out still in first place.\n\nSargeant and Magnussen have collided in turn three which brings out the safety car. The McLaren pit crew are out for Norris but he has gone past the pits. Crucially for him he gets past the Safety Car before it emerges from the pits so this could be massive for Norris.\n\nThe current top two both come into the pits so Norris inherits the lead. Verstappen is up into second and Leclerc in third. Piastri's tyres are nearly 10 laps younger than Leclerc's.\n\nNorris has just set a new fastest lap of the race and is now just over two seconds behind Sainz, who is just under three seconds behind current race leader Piastri.\n\nThe Dutchman comes in just after the VSC ended and changes to the hard tyre. He was worried about his front wing after hitting the bollard but Red Bull do not change the front wing. Piastri inherits the race lead as Verstappen is now in fourth after his stop.\n\nVerstappen has to cut the chicane at turn 15 as he gets out of shape and he hits the bollard. The virtual safety car comes out to pick up the debris that was on the track. But it does not last long so the frontrunners do not have the time to come into the pits under the VSC. A few of the runners further down like Fernando Alonso do come in though.\n\nNow that Norris has got free air, he has got permission from his team to go after Sainz. The gap between Sainz in fourth and Norris in fifth is four and a half seconds.\n\nFerrari have brought Leclerc into the pits to put the hard tyre on. He comes back out onto the track in sixth, just ahead of Russell crucially for Ferrari.\n\nRed Bull bring Perez in, with Norris putting him under huge pressure. Norris is therefore sent into free air whilst Perez comes out in tenth place on the hard tyre.\n\nRed Bull have told Verstappen to pick up the pace as Piastri is around three seconds behind the current race leader, showing good pace.\n\nHis teammate Norris is putting Perez under pressure for fifth place.\n\nIt seems unlikely a number of drivers will be able to execute a one-stop as Hulkenberg and Gasly are the latest to change tyres, onto the hards.\n\nThat Albon stop has set of a chain reaction as Stroll, Sargeant and Bottas all come in to change tyres.\n\nMeanwhile Russell has got past Hulkenberg into turn 11 and he is up into eighth place.\n\nWe are only just over ten laps into the race but we have the first pit-stop in the shape of Williams' Alex Albon. We think it will be a one-stop race but Albon will have to take his hard tyres nearly 50 laps.\n\nThe stewards have decided that there is no further investigation necessary for Perez regarding a possible false start.\n\nLewis had plenty of fights with a Haas yesterday in the sprint in the shape of Magnussen and he is fighting with Hulkenberg at the moment. Hulkenberg has re-passed Hamilton after a huge lock-up by Lewis at turn 17.\n\nThe Mexican is currently being investigated for a potential false start.\n\nCarlos Sainz has told his team he believes Perez should be receiving a penalty for flying up the inside of turn one on the opening lap. Yesterday in the sprint Hamilton did exactly the same but the stewards decided not to penalise Hamilton.\n\nTalking of Lewis, he has just got past Hulkenberg into turn 11 and into seventh place.\n\nPiastri gets DRS down the back straight and into turn 17 he gets the move done on Leclerc. The Ferrari driver does get DRS down the main straight but Piastri holds onto second place.\n\nVerstappen is over a second ahead of Leclerc so the Monagasque does not have DRS, but behind him Piastri does. This has been a terrific start from Piastri, who started sixth.\n\nThe seven-time world champion is under pressure in the early stages as he is on the slower hard tyres. Hulkenberg goes around the outside of Hamilton at turn one and gets the move done. He is up into seventh place.\n\nVerstappen holds first after a good start and Leclerc is unable to put pressure. There is a huge lock-up from Perez, who nearly goes piling into the back of his teammate. Piastri is the one who makes major gains as he is up from sixth to third. Super start from the Australian.\n\nWe are under way in Miami.\n\nWe are expecting a one-stop race today. Most drivers are starting on the mediums, but the only driver in the top ten who is not is Lewis Hamilton, who starts on the hard tyres. We have a few hard and soft tyres towards the back of the grid.\n\nThe drivers are now making their way around on the formation lap. We are just moments away from lights out.\n\nThe many, many celebrities on the grid are going to have to get off the track to make way for the main attraction. We are just five minutes away from lights out in Miami.\n\nThe stars are out in Miami and here is Sky's Martin Brundle speaking to popstar Camila Cabello.\n\nWill.i.am and Camila Cabello are two of many celebrities in attendance in Miami. But you feel most of the attention will be on Donald Trump.\n\nAs has been the case at every Grand Prix so far this season, Max Verstappen will start on pole for today's Miami Grand Prix. The Red Bull driver secured his seventh straight pole position, dating back into last season, and he made it six poles out of six to start the 2024 season. Despite taking pole, Verstappen was not entirely happy with his car.\n\n\"We definitely improved the car a bit,\" Verstappen said. \"I don't know what it is, every single year we come here, I find it extremely difficult to be consistent with the car feeling, the tyre feeling over one lap. It's super hard to make sure that Sector 1 feels good, then Sector 3 at the end of the lap. To make that happen together is incredibly tough.\n\n\"Again today, it was about finding that balance. I think we did OK. It wasn't the most enjoyable lap of my career because of how slippery it is and you're not very confident on the lap. But we are on pole, and that's the most important thing.\"\n\nVerstappen's seven straight poles takes him to within one of Ayrton Senna's all-time record of eight. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start on the front-row alongside Verstappen, which mirrors the front row from the sprint yesterday. Leclerc's teammate Carlos Sainz starts in third with Sergio Perez fourth. The McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri line up alongside each other on the third row. They are followed by the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton on the fourth row, with Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda rounding out the top ten. Both Aston Martins failed to get out of Q2.\n\nBefore qualifying took place yesterday, we had the sprint which Verstappen won from sprint pole ahead of Leclerc. Norris and Stroll had to retire after an incident at turn one which also involved Fernando Alonso and Hamilton. Mercedes failed to score a point in the sprint as Hamilton received a 20-second penalty for a pitlane infringement.\n\nThe race gets under way at 9pm BST.

While it was looking like yet another season which will be dominated by one man, Norris pretty much came out of nowhere to register a win that is sure to open the table up while also instilling the belief that Verstappen is far from being invincible.\n\nNorris, who was competing in the 110th race for McLaren, got the better of Verstappen beating the Red Bull driver by over seven seconds. It was Ferrari's Charles Leclerc who finished third and completed the set of podium finishes. Despite Norris' win, Verstappen who had started the Miami GP 2024 on pole and has won four of the opening five races of the season, leads the world championship standings.\n\nREAD HERE | Indian Oil Corporation To Produce F1 Racing Fuel In Next Three Months\n\nLando Norris Social Media Reaction After Maiden F1 Win Goes Viral\n\nMclaren's Lando Norris, excited about his maiden Formula 1 win, took to social media to react.

Norris was exceptional, he took some good fortune from the timing of a safety car but then had to deliver for 24 laps with flawless precision, as the triple world champion Verstappen loomed in his mirrors.\n\nNorris not only held his nerve but demonstrated, as he has made clear in the past, he has no fear of taking on Verstappen as long he is in a straight head to head fight. This was the moment and Norris had to deliver through perhaps the most intense, pressurised, 24 laps of his life.\n\nRelated: Formula One: Lando Norris wins Miami Grand Prix - as it happened\n\nIt has been some time coming, the debut win for the 24-year-old from Glastonbury was taken at his 110th grand prix after he made his debut at the Australian GP in 2019. He has claimed eight second places and might have had a win in Russia in 2021 only to be unlucky with late rain but he has repeatedly demonstrated the skill and verve to compete with the best at the very front.\n\nFor Norris then, who has long shown exceptional promise, this was the vindication for a driver who is much admired. Verstappen had looked to be in control out front until the race was turned on its head around the mid point. McLaren had taken a chance on leaving Norris out long before his pit stop and from where he inherited the lead.\n\nVerstappen had pitted on lap 24 and when Logan Sargeant crashed out, tangling with Kevin Magnussen on lap 29, it prompted a safety car under which Norris gained a free stop, ensuring he emerged once more in the lead from Verstappen.\n\nHe duly held his lead at the restart on lap 33 as Verstappen struggled to bring his tyres up to speed and Norris opened a gap with his fresher rubber but it was impossibly tense as the British driver put in a series of flawless laps he knew were vital.\n\nA series of fastest laps followed, they began ticking away and as unlikely as it seemed, Verstappen it appeared had nothing more to bring, complaining he lacked grip. For once it was Norris in complete command at the front, delivering on what he has always said he could do.\n\nThe safety car had fallen in his favour but Norris held his nerve with an absolute iron will to close out like a champion. The lead grew as the laps counted down until he took the flag and a historic first victory by 7.6 seconds from Verstappen.\n\nHis laughter and shrieking celebration from the cockpit was exultant and he was sportingly clapped by Lewis Hamilton as the seven-time champion drew level with him on the in-lap.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much. We did it Will,\" he bellowed to his race engineer Will Joseph. \"I guess that's how it's done, finally. I knew it when I came in in this morning, I said today is the day for opportunities. Thanks Mum, thanks Dad, this one's for my Grandma.\"\n\nHe then threw himself upon his team, crowdsurfing into their welcoming arms.\n\nThe crowd too stood to acknowledge his feat with absolutely raucous approval. For three years the fans have been coming to the track which winds its way round the Hard Rock stadium in Miami Gardens and they have yet to see anyone but Verstappen take victory here. That the Dutchman's stranglehold was broken by a driver so popular in the US and in making history as he did so was the sporting drama they appreciated with enormous acclaim.\n\n\"I am very happy for Lando it's been a long time coming and its definitely not going to be his last one, he deserved it today,\" said Verstappen, who nonetheless extended his lead in the title race to 35 points from Red Bull teammate P\u00e9rez who was fifth.\n\nBy the time the champagne was flowing, that the fans had a good time was palpable. Finally a new winner in Miami and proof positive there is a place for bopping about in a bikini while quaffing cocktails in F1 just as there is a place for standing in a waterproof in sheets of rain on a grassy knoll at Spa, as long as there is a great show on track and for the first time both Miami and Norris delivered in spades in that department.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were third and fourth. Sergio P\u00e9rez was fifth for Red Bull, Hamilton and his teammate George Russell sixth and eighth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda seventh for RB, Fernando Alonso ninth for Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon tenth for Alpine.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One",

It's been a long time coming and after taking the chequered flag, Norris' first reaction pretty much said it all, \"Oh about time?\" McLaren managed to halt the Red Bull juggernaut as Max Verstappen came second ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n\nF1 Miami Grand Prix: Norris takes the chequered flag\n\nOn his 110th Formula 1 race, Lando Norris finally shed the tag of having maximum podiums without a win. It wasn't a blistering start as some were hoping for the Briton who started fifth on the grid. With his teammate Oscar Piastri having a flying start, McLaren opted for a watch-and-wait strategy by extending his opening run and going for a late pit stop. The race gods were smiling down upon the McLaren man as Williams' Logan Sargeant's crash on Lap 29 forced the safety car to emerge on the track. After finishing one lap behind the safety car, McLaren told Norris to box and with a lightning-quick pitstop, he was back on the track ahead of Verstappen.\n\nOnce the race restarted on Lap 33, Verstappen was on McLaren's heels and was threatening to overtake, but Norris showed skill and maturity as he continued to defend his place and ensured he was nowhere near the DRS zone. As the British driver started to increase his lead from around six seconds to eventually crossing the finish line with a lead of 7.61 seconds, Verstappen was dealing with his demons as the car had understeering issues. The 24-year-old Norris finally laid to rest his almost-winning 2021 Russian Grand Prix moment and gave McLaren its first win since Daniel Ricciardo at the Italian Grand Prix in 2021. In that race, Norris came second.\n\nF1 Miami Grand Prix: All is not rosy for Ferrari and Piastri\n\nFerrari was expected to throw the gauntlet and be Red Bull's worst nightmare after starting second and third. Sadly, both Leclerc and his teammate Carlos Sainz were slow off the block allowing McLaren's Pistari to overtake them at the start of the race. After the restart, Piastri was involved in two racing incidents with Sainz. The second episode on Lap 39 became a bit nasty as the Ferrari man lost control of his car and hit Piastri.\n\nThis resulted in a broken front wing for the McLaren driver and the Australian had no choice but to pit due to this he finished 13th. Due to this collision, Sainz was handed a five-second penalty by the stewards and the Ferrari man lost his fourth place to Sergio Perez as he had to contend with fifth. It was a quiet race for Leclerc as he couldn't match Verstappen's pace and took the final podium spot.\n\nF1 Miami Grand Prix: The top 10\n\nWith such an underwhelming season so far, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff stated that with all the problems the team is currently facing, even the genius engineer Adrian Newey of Red Bull would struggle to find solutions. There was something to cheer about as Lewis Hamilton secured his season-best finish as he came sixth at the Miami GP.

I guess people doubted me along the way, and I have made mistakes over the last five years, in my short career, but I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris was a popular winner, with Lewis Hamilton, who finished sixth, slowing down on his in-lap before taking both hands off the steering wheel to congratulate his countryman.\n\n\"Lando was flying,\" said Verstappen after he finished 7.6 seconds behind Norris. \"I am very happy for him.

But only people who didn't properly recognise Norris' qualities doubted him.\n\n\"I wasn't worried,\" Norris said, \"and I knew my time was coming.\"\n\nNorris is the son of a millionaire stock market trader. But his talent has been obvious from a very early age, and the closer he got to F1 through his junior career, the more it became obvious he was marked out for great things.\n\nAged 18, early in 2018, Norris was team-mate to Alonso at the Daytona 24 Hours sportscar race. It was hardly the point of their appearance, but Norris set himself a private target of leaving the event with a faster lap time than Alonso - and did it.\n\nAt the time, Norris was McLaren's F1 reserve driver and Alonso was racing for them. Later that year, after McLaren had said they would promote Norris from reserve driver to their race team for the 2019 season, the Briton generated a few laughs in a wet practice session at the US Grand Prix in Austin by playing the boy and taking Alonso a cuppa while everyone waited for the track to dry.\n\nBut it did not take long once he was into a full-time F1 seat for Norris to shed the image of an apprentice. He went toe-to-toe with Carlos Sainz in their two seasons together and gave nothing away.\n\nHe came close to a win in Russia in 2021, when he put the McLaren on pole and led most of the race confidently before mistakenly choosing to stay out on dry-weather slicks when it rained late on.\n\nSainz left for Ferrari at the end of 2020 and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, then a seven-time race winner for Red Bull.\n\nThe talk before the partnership started was of how the pressure was all on Norris to prove he could match up. But from the off it was Norris who was the quicker driver.\n\nWhen McLaren finally achieved the win that cemented their re-emergence as a front-running team after a few difficult years, it was Ricciardo who took it, on a rare strong weekend in Monza. Norris was quicker, but he'd qualified a place behind.\n\nAnd when Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen crashed out together and left the McLarens running one-two, Norris dutifully followed team orders not to fight with his team-mate.\n\nRed Bull's domination of the past three years had made a win look far away, especially after McLaren slipped back in 2022 and early 2023. But since a change of leadership heading into 2023, the team have been on a rapid upward trajectory, and by the second half of last year had emerged as one of the leading challengers to Red Bull.\n\nTheir progress in the past year can be seen by the fact that Norris and his team-mate Oscar Piastri qualified 16th and 19th in Miami in 2023. This year, they arrived at the race with an upgrade they hoped would bring them closer to Red Bull.\n\nNorris had had a scrappy weekend until the grand prix. But once clear of Sergio Perez's Red Bull in the first stint, he was the quickest guy on track. He ran long, and an opportunely timed safety car vaulted him into the lead, and he had more than enough pace at the restart to pull away from Verstappen, albeit that Red Bull said the car had been damaged when the Dutchman hit a bollard just before his pit stop.\n\n\"I took it easy (at the start),\" Norris said. \"I could see Max and when you can see Max, there is hope.\n\n\"I knew there would be opportunities. Everyone boxed (pitted) ahead of me and I was able to use all the pace I had and that turned into that little bit of luck. Sometimes you have to have a bit of luck on your side but I will take it happily.\"\n\nThe win augurs well for McLaren for the rest of the year. They won't expect to challenge Verstappen regularly, But this, the latest in a line of upgrades dating back to last summer, confirms their strong trajectory under team principal Andrea Stella, who has been a revelation since he was promoted from performance director over the winter of 2022-23.\n\n\"I said at the beginning of the year we could win races,\" Norris said. \"A lot of people doubted that but I was confident. The team have done an amazing job. We weren't even in Q2 last year; the fact we have won a race shows the team have done an insane job to go from there to where we are today.\"\n\nThere was a certain symbolism to the fact that the first race this season in which Verstappen has been beaten in a straight fight was at the event after it was announced that Adrian Newey was leaving Red Bull.\n\nAnd it only served to emphasise a certain end-of-the-empire feeling swirling around Red Bull.\n\nThe weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium was dominated by Newey, and the turmoil at Red Bull, which many in F1 feel is giving every impression of a team slowly imploding.\n\nNewey's decision to leave was partly influenced by the controversy surrounding team principal Christian Horner, who has been accused of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour by a female employee.\n\nHorner denies the allegations, and has been cleared by one internal investigation. Another is ongoing after the complainant appealed, and while that is also expected to end with the same result, there will be further developments as time goes by.\n\nThis was not Newey's only concern. He has also been annoyed by what he perceives as attempts by certain figures in the team to publicly play down his influence in their current success, while he considers that the 2022 RB18 car that laid the foundations for the team's success - the 2023 and 2024 cars are evolutions of it - was very much his design.\n\n\"(I've been considering leaving for) a little while now, if I'm honest,\" he told Sky Sports in his only on-the-record interview in Miami.\n\n\"I guess over the winter a little bit and then as events have unfolded this year I thought I'm in a very lucky position where I don't need to work to live.\n\n\"I work because I enjoy it. I just felt that now was a good time to step back and take a bit of a break and take stock of life, and go travelling a bit.\"\n\nHorner was asked after the race whether he should consider his position in the light of Newey's decision. He deflected the question and insisted the team were well set for the future.\n\nOther senior figures at Red Bull are known to be unsettled. McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown predicted that Newey would not be the last to leave, while Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff confirmed he was waiting on deciding on his 2025 driver line-up because \"we want to take our time, see where Max's thinking goes\".\n\nVerstappen is contracted to Red Bull to the end of 2028. But he admitted he would have \"preferred\" Newey to stay and is known to have been unsettled by the Horner situation.\n\nThe big question is whether he is unsettled enough to leave. This is considered unlikely by senior sources in time for next season but a real possibility for 2026, when F1's rules change for both engines and chassis.\n\nVerstappen and his management are said to have concerns as to whether Red Bull's new engine arm will be able to compete with the car manufacturers who will be its opposition.\n\nIf Verstappen wants to go, he can do so whenever he wants.\n\nHe has a contractual arrangement with Red Bull that means that if motorsport adviser Helmut Marko leaves, so can Verstappen.\n\nA dispute between Marko and Horner is part of the power struggle at Red Bull that has broken out into the open since the Horner allegations.\n\nSenior sources have told BBC Sport that Marko has promised Verstappen that he will do whatever he wants - so if Verstappen wants to leave, Marko will make it possible by quitting.\n\nAnd if Verstappen follows Newey out of the door, Red Bull will have lost the greatest designer in F1 history and the driver most in F1 consider to be the best on the grid right now.\n\nAll dominant teams run out of steam in the end. The end of this Red Bull era will not be this year, but in the circumstances it's not hard to imagine how it could come about.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first

There was an element of fortune involved, with the timing of the Safety Car lifting Norris from a contender into the leader, but the young Briton had rapid pace in the upgraded MCL38, which he was able to unleash once freed from the train of cars ahead.\n\nExtending his first stint longer than his rivals catapulted Norris from fifth place into the lead, from where he was advantageously able to make his sole pit stop under the Safety Car, re-emerging still at the front.\n\nAt the restart, Norris was able to pull clear of second-placed Verstappen, and the Red Bull driver had no answer for Norris' pace, with the McLaren driver eventually chalking up win number one by seven seconds.\n\nUnsurprisingly there was a deluge of emotions from Norris as he crossed the line, screaming on the radio, before leaping into the arms of his McLaren mechanics in parc ferme. The host of drivers who lined up to congratulate him -- the likes of Lewis Hamilton, former team-mates Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz, and Fernando Alonso -- highlighted how rivals were genuinely delighted that he finally mounted the top step of the podium.\n\n\"To get that first victory is always incredible,\" said Norris. \"I've of course had my moments where I've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win. But I wasn't worried. As much as a lot of people doubted that I was going to be able to put it together and win a race, I wasn't worried. I've been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes and the team has got what it takes. It was an incredible race.\"\n\nIt was a sign of how far McLaren had come in the last 12 months that Norris was knocked out of Q1 and raced to only 17th place in Miami last year.\n\n\"I said it at the beginning of the year that we can win races,\" said Norris. \"Deep down, I knew that we had our time coming. We're on top, we've won a race, the team have done an insane job to go from where we were to where we are now. And we've chipped away.\"\n\nNorris was meant to be on a flight back to Europe straight after the race on Sunday evening but McLaren chief Zak Brown gave the all-clear to delay that another day to celebrate.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win,\" said a smiling Norris, adding \"I might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow,\" referring to a cut he sustained while in Amsterdam last weekend.\n\nVerstappen Still Extends Title Lead\n\nGiven that Max Verstappen was eliminated from the Australian Grand Prix through reliability, this was the World Champion's first on-track defeat since the Singapore Grand Prix last September.\n\nThe timing of the safety car was fortuitous for Norris, but through most of the weekend Verstappen was never fully comfortable behind the wheel of the RB20 -- despite claiming Sprint victory and pole position, and did not display the usual commanding authority.\n\nVerstappen led the opening half of the Grand Prix on Sunday, but his margin over then nearest rival Oscar Piastri rarely extended to more than a few seconds, while he wiped out the bollard on the apex of Turn 14 after running wide.\n\nVerstappen had no answer to Norris' pace in the second half of the race, and briefly had to keep an eye on third-placed Charles Leclerc, though despite the rarity of not winning Verstappen still extended his title advantage to 35 points.\n\nVerstappen was circumspect at the manner of the defeat, congratulating good friend Norris, before laughing that he wanted to test the durability of the front wing by hitting the bollard.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"We're all used to that in racing, right? Today was a bit tricky. I think already on the Mediums it didn't feel fantastic, we were pulling away but not like it should be.\n\n\"Then once we made a pit stop I heard what the lap times McLaren were doing and I was like, 'Well, that's pretty quick! Once then they also switched onto the Hard tire, they just had more pace, especially Lando he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint but if a bad day is P2 I take it.\"\n\nHaas' Magnussen Closer to Race Suspension\n\nKevin Magnussen earned penalties for playing the team game on Saturday, but on Sunday it was a clumsy piece of driving that brought the Dane yet another sanction.\n\nMagnussen collided with sole U.S. representative Logan Sargeant into Turn 3, pitching the Williams driver into the wall and consequent retirement, bringing to an end what had been a quietly effective weekend for the Floridian.\n\nMagnussen received a 10-second time penalty but also copped two penalty points for the incident, and was then also handed a 20-second time penalty for failing to serve the penalty correctly.\n\nThe Sargeant clash brings Magnussen up to 10 penalty points, all of which have been earned in 2024, meaning he must navigate the remainder of the season -- 18 races and 4 Sprint races -- without picking up another two penalty points. Drivers receive a one-event suspension if they amass 12 penalty points within a 12-month period and while no driver has hit that threshold since the system was introduced, Magnussen is now as close as anyone has ever been.\n\nHe also faces a sizeable period of time in which he must avoid another error.\n\n\"It wasn't a good day, again,\" said Magnussen. \"Hopefully I can get some clarity on things going forward. What happened today, of course it's not good, but nonetheless we try to move on and have a better weekend next weekend.\"\n\nHaas would need a replacement driver for one weekend in the event of Magnussen picking up another two penalty points between now and Abu Dhabi; Ferrari youngster Oliver Bearman is Haas' reserve driver.\n\nHaas went away empty-handed from Sunday's race as Nico Hulkenberg finished 11, one position outside of the points, with Alpine's Esteban Ocon picking up his and the team's first top 10 finish of the campaign.", "source": {"uri": "autoweek.com",

The McLaren driver was naturally grinning from ear to ear after winning the 2024 Miami GP. After enjoying the champagne and confetti on the podium, Norris confessed in the post-race press conference that he would party to the fullest on Sunday night.\n\nNorris expressed how he would have liked to win his maiden race in Silverstone, his home Grand Prix. However, on this, Max Verstappen jumped in to say, \"It's definitely better here [Miami] mate to go out\", hinting how the night party in Miami would be much better than in Silverstone.\n\nNorris promised how it was going to be a \"good night\" of partying. Now, it was natural that Verstappen would join Norris to celebrate the latter breaking his duck of wins. The duo reportedly went to a club and a Twitter (now X), video shows them dancing in the club.\n\nThe 24-year-old had been getting a lot of criticism and trolling for not winning a Grand Prix, unlike his peers. So, his Miami victory helped him to shut that narrative down, once and for all.\n\nNorris has been living with the regret of not capitalizing on his advantageous position to win in Sochi back in 2021. The Briton had been the star of that weekend, taking pole in rainy conditions by over half a second. In the Grand Prix too, Norris was leading comfortably before a late shower spoilt his party.\n\nHis decision of not pitting for intermediate tires at the right time cost him his maiden win back in Russia three years ago. Cut to May 2024, it is understandable why Norris changed his flight plans, given celebrating his maiden win was warranted after such a long wait.\n\nGoing into the Miami Grand Prix, many expected Max Verstappen to continue his winning run. While there were murmurs of Ferrari being competitive and challenging the Dutchman, McLaren was just looking to hone their new upgrade package.\n\nHowever, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were in the thick of things at the top as the race got underway. While Piastri suffered after pitting just before the safety car, Norris was lucky to get the benefit of a free pit stop under the safety car.\n\nNow, at this stage, many still thought that Verstappen would eventually catch up to Norris and overtake him for the lead. However, with the benefit of fresher hard tires and a highly upgraded MCL38, the McLaren driver kept extending his advantage at the front.\n\nVerstappen himself was happy to see his friend take the win away from him, given he knew how much the Briton was yearning for it. Eventually, the three-time champion settled for a P2 finish, seven seconds behind Norris taking the chequered flag.\n\nThe Dutchman mentioned that he was quite impressed to see McLaren's pace on the hard tires in the last stint of the race.

(AP) -- Lando Norris needed 110 starts and a mistake by Max Verstappen to earn his first ever Formula 1 race on Sunday and end Verstappen's dominance at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars. McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren before the start of the race hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free

The McLaren driver's triumph marks a significant milestone in his career and adds excitement to the ongoing championship battle in the world of motorsport.\n\nLando Norris secured his first Formula 1 win by edging out Max Verstappen in a thrilling race at the Miami Grand Prix. Verstappen, a close friend of Norris, commended the McLaren driver for his impressive achievement.\n\nCapitalizing on a stroke of luck, Norris seized the opportunity to claim victory at the Miami Grand Prix, fending off Verstappen's challenge throughout the race.

It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--KDNx99aY--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1714947547/4KQLZCC_063_2151615254_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He has confidence. He is fast. He is funny. He has a great personality.\n\n\"I feel like for a while now it's been like 'someday he's going to win a championship' and it's very, very cool to see him win his first race.\n\n\"I'm sure it feels so sweet too with how many high points, and lows, he's had in the last couple of races.\"\n\nNorris' first win at the 110th attempt in F1 was just three fewer races than it took Jenson Button to climb the podium's top step, at the 2006 Hungarian GP.\n\nButton went on to win 15 grands prix and the 2009 world title before joining Sky Sports.\n\n\"Very proud of him,\" said Button, who was McLaren's reserve driver when Norris joined the Woking outfit's young driver programme aged 17 in 2017.\n\n\"It has been a long time coming. It feels like forever when you are in the sport and you haven't won a race.\n\n\"He's had a couple of opportunities, it hasn't gone his way, so it's lovely to see him on the top step.\n\n\"That memory sticks with you forever. You still need the car to perform and get that result again. For me it took three years [between first and second win], hopefully it won't take him that long to win his second race.\n\n\"But it doesn't change the way he's going to go racing. He's a confident driver, he's very skilled and he's a team player. So I expect to see them winning more over the years to come and I just hope it's sooner rather than later so we can have this fight between Red Bull and McLaren, which would be amazing.\"\n\nPatrick agreed that, while clearly a significant moment in his career, Norris was already clearly on an upward trajectory.\n\n\"Sometimes you learn how to win,\" she added. \"You have the right mentality for it and everyone starts picturing and seeing you that way, which has its own momentum and energy.\n\n\"But I'm not sure it really changes a whole lot because we all saw this coming. He's almost won many times and everyone believes we are going to see him win so many more, and eventually a championship.\n\n\"So this is the beginning of something really fun.\"\n\nOne notable aspect of Norris' Miami triumph was the way in which his peers on the grid, including some of F1's most successful ever drivers, warmly congratulated him on the long-awaited success both in person and through their own post-race interviews.\n\n\"They mean it too,\" said Martin Brundle.\n\n\"They searched him out to say congratulations. He's a nice lad in the car and out of the car, but fiercely competitive too of course. It's a popular victory all round.\n\n\"He deserves it. He's earned it the hard way and it is a big moment.\"\n\nAlthough eight of his 15 career podium finishes up to Miami had come since last July - including an impressive seven second places - it has been unfortunate timing in many respects for the ever-improving Englishman.\n\nThat's because those strong results have coincided with Max Verstappen's near-total dominance of the sport.\n\nPerhaps gallingly for Norris and many of the grid's other leading names was the fact that, up until Miami, on both occasions in the previous 25 races that Verstappen didn't win, it was Ferrari's Carlos Sainz who beat them to it. At last September's Singapore GP, Norris finished a tantalising 0.8 seconds behind Sainz, his former McLaren team-mate, in second place.\n\nBut what was truly Norris' greatest victory near-miss came at the Russian GP of 2021.\n\nOn the weekend he became Britain's youngest-polesitter, Norris led Lewis Hamilton at the front with three laps to go yet finished only seventh after suffering late-race heartache in the rain.\n\nThe McLaren driver's race spectacularly unravelled on the decision not to pit for intermediate tyres as rain started to fall late on in Sochi. Like Norris, Hamilton was initially of the same mind to stay out on slicks but Mercedes overruled the seven-time champion and brought him in, whereas McLaren kept their less-experienced man out.\n\nBut with the rain only intensifying from there, Norris spun off the road at the first corner on his slicks with two laps to go, with Hamilton on his grippier tyres moving ahead and going on to secure his 100th win. By the time the McLaren was in the pits and put on the right tyres, it was all too little, too late.\n\n\"I'm unhappy, devastated in a way,\" said Norris afterwards. \"It was my decision, I thought it was the way to go.\n\n\"It was the wrong one at the end of the day but I made the decision just as much as the team.\"\n\nThat Sochi race and agonising end result came two weeks after Norris had seen an unexpected first victory chance pass him by when he finished second to then-team-mate Daniel Ricciardo at Monza in McLaren's first win since 2012.\n\nAs was the case for most of their two years together, Norris had outqualified Ricciardo in Italy and lined up fourth for the Saturday Sprint. But he was beaten by the sister car in the 18-lap mini-race, a result which proved crucial to the outcome a day later.\n\nWith the results of the Sprint at that time setting the starting order for the Sunday Grand Prix, Ricciardo started as the lead McLaren on the main grid and as he took the race lead from pole-sitter Verstappen at the start, Norris dropped behind Hamilton, and the tone was set for the Australian to go on and claim his eighth career win.\n\nNorris ended up finishing 1.7s behind Ricciardo in second after Verstappen and Hamilton's second controversial collision of the season had taken both title contenders out, bringing out the Safety Car.\n\nFifty-eight races later, McLaren are back in the winner's circle - and this time the moment is undisputedly Norris'.\n\nFormula 1 heads to Europe as Imola returns to the calendar following last year's cancelled race.

Norris moved his way to second as the cars ahead of him made pit stops and was clicking off fast laps on his medium compound tires.\n\nHe took over the lead after Verstappen pitted just before Carlos Sainz and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri did. Once Piastri pitted, Norris took over the race lead and was leading the race when Magnussen and Sergeant collided in the first sector.\n\nThe safety car allowed Norris to make his only pit stop of the day and stay ahead of everyone else when he left the pit lane.\n\nSimply put, Norris wouldn't have won the race if the crash hadn't happened when it did. But his win wasn't solely due to the safety car either. Norris pulled a second ahead of Verstappen a lap after the restart and then drove away from the three-time defending world champion over the final 24 laps of the 57-lap race.\n\nNorris, 24, is also the first driver not named Verstappen to win a race in Miami. Verstappen entered Sunday's Grand Prix as the winner of the first two races on the circuit around Hard Rock Stadium and won Saturday's sprint race rather easily.\n\nBut Verstappen's car simply didn't have any performance over the final stint of the race. He complained over his radio of a lack of front grip and found himself much closer to third-place finisher Charles Leclerc than Norris by the end of the race. Verstappen was 7.6 seconds adrift of Norris at the finish line and just 2.3 seconds ahead of Leclerc.\n\nNorris is just the third driver outside of Verstappen to win a race since the start of the 2023 season. Verstappen won 19 of 22 races a season ago, while his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez got two wins and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz won once. Entering Sunday's race, Sainz was the only driver other than Verstappen to get a win through the first five races of 2024 after Verstappen was forced to retire early from the Australian Grand Prix because of a brake issue.\n\nThe victory is also McLaren's first since 2021 and just the team's second since 2012. Until Sunday, Daniel Ricciardo's win at Monza three seasons ago was the only time in the past 12 seasons that the team had gotten the top step of the podium.\n\nBut the team had been inching closer and closer to a win since the second half of the 2023 season. After a miserable start to the 2023 season -- Norris finished 17th in the first two races and had four 17th-place finishes over the first seven races of the season -- McLaren's upgrades paid some serious dividends as the season went on.\n\nNorris went on to score seven podiums and have an average finish of eighth last season with just one finish outside the top nine over the final 13 races of 2023.\n\nMcLaren's speed carried over to 2024 too. Though the team has been third-best on the grid overall behind Red Bull and Ferrari, Norris finished third in the Australian Grand Prix and was second in the Chinese Grand Prix. He hasn't finished worse than eighth in any of the first six races of this season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Formula One World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test driver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/quN5GLCwBA5SlATU1nStSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/51bd9850-0b25-11ef-abf6-7b35ac947007", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-06T025455Z_1842222318_MT1USATODAY23200564_RTRMADP_3_FORMULA-ONE-MIAMI-GRAND-PRIX-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He (Trump) said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris's mother and father were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them.\n\n\"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven-times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest.\n\nWorld champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130.\n\nNorris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more.

Perhaps not. After the chequered flag, everybody under the sun wanted to congratulate Lando Norris: his jubilant McLaren team, his fellow drivers, even Donald Trump, present at the Hard Rock Stadium, seemed outshone by the boy from Bristol and his unshakable smile at the end of the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nThe phrase on everyone's lips was that it had been a \"long time coming\" for the 24-year-old. That's true. 110 races, 15 podiums and one excruciating mishap in Russia three years ago speak to that. But Norris has finally entered the winners' circle, on Sunday becoming the 21 Brit to win a Formula 1 race. For the first time in 18 months, God Save the King was belted out at the F1 podium ceremony.\n\nAs often is the case in the slender margins of elite sport, fortune played its role in the Florida heat. Norris started fifth on the grid, a day after crashing out on lap one of the sprint race, with optimism perhaps surprisingly high. He'd stated in the team briefing on Sunday morning that it was a day \"full of opportunities.\" Yet with Max Verstappen on pole position once again, overhauling the Red Bulls and Ferraris out in front seemed a daunting task.\n\nBut Norris, and his unfortunate team-mate Oscar Piastri whose race was ruined just as Norris saw victory ahead, showed excellent pace throughout this 57-lap grand prix. The Australian stormed up to second after a few laps and, strikingly, kept the Ferraris behind him. Norris, like a predator ready to pounce, stayed behind the front four.\n\n\"I'll go get him,\" he said to race engineer Will Joseph, when tasked with overtaking Carlos Sainz ahead. As he later pointed out, he'd actually need not overtake any cars on track.\n\nIt was lap 28, minutes after Norris had taken the lead with his competitors pitting, when the size of the opportunity suddenly dawned. A crash between backmarkers Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant resulted in a safety car and, effectively, gave Norris a free pit stop. He came in for fresh rubber and once the safety car picked up the then 19-car pack, the race had a new leader in papaya colours.\n\nMcLaren rolled the Miami dice. And it came up trumps.\n\nCould Norris keep Verstappen behind him with 25 laps to go? The trickiest moment came right at the start, with the Dutchman hustling his close friend right up to the home straight. Norris held the inside line, and his nerve, to stay ahead. Little did we know then, but that secured his maiden win.\n\nBecause contrary to the forecasts, Verstappen did not haul Norris in. The Briton quickly (and vitally) strode on ahead by more than one second, leaving the Red Bull without the extra pace given with DRS. From there, lap-by-lap, Norris increased his lead.\n\nHe then went unchallenged; Red Bull were powerless.\n\nThe closing stages were nervy - you'd need only look on the tense faces in the McLaren garage - but Norris was not to be denied. So often the nearly man, smiling on the podium with a lingering sense of unfulfillment, this was to be his time. His joy and relief was palpable.\n\nHe screamed over team radio: \"We did it Will! I guess that's how it's done. Finally, ah so happy! We did it.\" He jumped over his adoring mechanics, who hoisted him into the air, as McLaren celebrated their first victory since Monza in September 2021.\n\nIt is a huge obstacle for Norris to finally overcome, the proverbial monkey off his back. It speaks volumes to the rapid ascension of Zak Brown's McLaren team, too. The American CEO - who gave a tour of the garage to Trump pre-race - and Italian team principal Andrea Stella have galvanised the Woking-based outfit in the last year or so, desperate for the former giants of F1 to return back to their perch.\n\nArmed with the third-quickest car after the first five races, McLaren brought a hair-raising 10 upgrades to this race. The stunning results come Sunday afternoon were on the timesheet. Not just Ferrari, but Red Bull could not cope. With three different winners in the first six races after Carlos Sainz's win in Australia, could this season be more competitive than we first feared?\n\nThat remains to be seen but amid the media interviews and selfies and commendations from his peers - Lewis Hamilton was adamant that Norris had to change his planned Sunday night flight out of Miami to celebrate - the unmistakable image was this: Norris, overwhelmed, emotional and ecstatic with pure joy, grinning from ear-to-ear.\n\n\"I'm not going to sleep,\" he said of Sunday night's celebrations in Miami, flight seemingly already cancelled. \"I'm going all the way!\" Fair enough, Lando. Like they've all said, it's been a long time coming.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Lando Norris finally ended his wait for a Formula 1 win on Sunday night as he secured victory for McLaren at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nStarting down in fifth on the grid, the British driver was expected to challenge for the podium places, yet not challenge Max Verstappen who had dominated the Sprint and qualifying.\n\nHowever, Norris took advantage of a safety car to get his nose in front, and he never relented as Red Bull's Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc struggled to keep pace with him during the closing 27 laps.\n\nThe win marked McLaren's first time at the top of the podium since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix, when Norris finished second behind Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nHow did Norris, McLaren, Verstappen react?\n\nNorris's triumph built on the second that he earned last time out in China, and the 24-year-old felt that his team managed to put together \"the perfect strategy\".\n\nSpeaking after the race, Norris said: \"The whole weekend has been good. I've had a few setbacks along the way.\n\n\"I knew on Friday we had the pace and just a couple of mistakes here and there but today we managed to put it together, we put the perfect strategy, it all paid off and thanks to McLaren and everyone and I have to give a shout out to my mum and dad of course.\"\n\nAddressing McLaren, he added: \"What do I say to them huh? I'm just proud really, I mean a lot of people doubted me along the way, I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career but today we put it altogether so this is all for the team.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nTeam principal Andrea Stella could also not hide his delight at the win, heaping praise on the team as a whole as they delivered one of their most famous victories in recent memory.\n\nHe said: \"The victory for Lando, he deserved it so much and we always said as soon as we give him the right material he's going to make it and he made it.\n\n\"I know what kind of work is behind it, it's so deserved for the McLaren team, I hope everyone enjoys this moment.\"\n\nAlthough Verstappen failed to win an F1 race for the second time this season, the Dutchman was magnanimous in defeat, accepting a rare second place on a day when the consensus was that Red Bull were not at their best.\n\nHe said: \"You win, you lose. We're all used to that in racing. Today was already quite tricky. The medium tyres didn't feel fantastic. Once we made a pitstop, I heard the lap times the McLarens were doing and thought 'wow, they're quick'.\n\n\"The hard tyres had more pace. Lando was flying. It was incredibly hard for us in that stint. If a bad day is P2, I'll take it. I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not gonna be his last one. He definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nHow does the Drivers' standings look?\n\nEven with the win in the United States, Norris only moves up to fourth place in the standings, alongside Carlos Sainz Jr on 83 points.\n\nVerstappen was still able to extend his lead over Sergio Perez to 33 points, with Leclerc now just five points adrift of the second-placed man.\n\nFurther down the rankings, Oscar Piastri is the best of the rest in sixth, yet a massive 42 points adrift of his McLaren teammate and Sainz Jr.\n\nID:543018:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect6633:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_plant@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Darren Plant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_motorcycle_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 Italian motorcycle Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stella_(engineer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stella (engineer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/19/lando-norris.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

(AFP)\n\nIt is doubtful there has been a more popular winner of a Formula One race in recent years than McLaren's Lando Norris, who was celebrated by everyone for Max Verstappen to Donald Trump following his victory at the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for Norris, who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), including an agonizing eight runner-up finishes, in 110 grand prix making the likeable Briton easy to root for.\n\nEven Verstappen, Red Bull's triple world champion who hates to lose and was denied a hat-trick of Miami wins by the McLaren driver, was among the first to congratulate Norris, who was mobbed by his team, crowd surfed along pit land and drenched in a shower of champagne.\n\n\"It was a long time coming, and I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today,\" smiled a genuinely pleased Verstappen. \"He definitely deserved it.\n\n\"It's great winning your first race. It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He (Trump) said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris's mother and father were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them.\n\n\"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven-times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest.\n\nWorld champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130.\n\nNorris was still finalizing plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more.

And it came at the expense of his friend Verstappen who failed to win for just the second time so far this season.\n\nThe Brit was helped to do so by the timing of a safety car period. It was called out when Logan Sargeant crashed, not long after Verstappen had pitted to yield the lead to Norris, who was yet to stop.\n\nThat afforded the McLaren driver a cheap pit stop and meant he was still leading when the race resumed. With fresh tyres and an upgraded car, he was able to pull away from the Red Bull and finally secure his first F1 win at the 110th attempt.\n\nIt is difficult to predict whether Norris would have had the pace to beat Verstappen had he not been able to take the lead with help from the safety car. When asked for his thoughts, the Dutchman directed the question to his rival.\n\n\"I don't know what the gap was, to be honest, before the safety car. How far were you behind me?\" he asked Norris, who replied: \"It would have been tough. I would have had to overtake two Ferraris, a Red Bull, Oscar [Piastri]. Oscar was doing a very good job, so hats off to him.\"\n\nAnd that was when Verstappen rather bluntly pointed out that it really doesn't matter. He said: \"I mean, it's always if, if, if, right? If my mum had balls, she would be my dad. So, yeah. I mean, it's how it goes to racing. Sometimes it works out for you, sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nIn response, Norris looked away from Verstappen and buried his face in his arm before hunching over as he laughed. And Charles Leclerc next to them was also giggling along with several members of the media in the room.\n\nIn the same press conference, Verstappen took the time to heap praise on his friend Norris. He said: \"I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today. He definitely deserved it. He was just miles faster at the end there. So, yeah, it's great. You know, winning your first race is always, I think, quite emotional.\n\n\"It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards Formula 1, and then you dream of being on the podium, but then being on the top step.

I'm just happy, proud. It feels like it's been a long time coming,\" Norris told Sky Sports F1.\n\n\"I feel like we've had many opportunities. We've been getting closer and closer.\n\n\"We've never been able to put it altogether and today was that day. We've been good all weekend.\n\n\"As much as we had some setbacks - Friday Qualifying, the Sprint, not the best Qualifying on Saturday, I stayed positive. And that's rare!\n\n\"It all just came together. We were quick all day. I had a good strategy, a good plan. I stayed out of the way of trouble in Turn One because it was very close. I just focused on our race and we were quick.\n\n\"Of course, we got a bit lucky with the Safety Car. But even after, the pace was the best on track by quite a long way.\n\n\"I have to say thanks to the team. Without this, it wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNorris had the full upgrade package in Miami from McLaren and looked quick immediately from first practice.\n\nHowever, Norris was on the wrong end of a first corner collision in Saturday's Sprint and qualified in fifth for Sunday's race.\n\nIt initially looked like a fight for the win between Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz and Norris' team-mate, Oscar Piastri, but Norris took advantage of a the Safety Car, for Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant's collision, before cruising away from Verstappen.\n\n\"As soon as the Safety Car came out. Even before I felt very good. The pace was amazing, the pace was better than Max and everyone,\" said Norris.\n\n\"I was a long way back but knew there could have been opportunities. Hard work turned into luck. It wasn't just luck. Things were going well and that little extra thing helped me out.\n\n\"As soon as the Safety Car came out I wasn't like 'Max is going to have me here'. I was confident.\n\n\"I didn't do the best of jobs on the restart. I defended into Turn One and from that point on it was fairly straightforward.\"\n\nNorris was initially meant to fly out from Miami after the race, but moved his flight back to Monday, in order to continue the celebrations.\n\nFollowing the race, he was congratulated by almost the entire field as he celebrated victory with his McLaren team.\n\n\"It's incredible. That's the best thing of all, the people you have respect for and the people you race against, when Fernando comes up to you and Lewis comes up to you, those are people I've looked up to since I was I kid,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact I'm racing against them and... they are probably not deep down happy for me, but they are happy for me and I respect that a lot and I'm thankful for that.\"\n\nNorris also paid tribute to former McLaren sporting director and consultant Gil de Ferran, who died at the end of last year.\n\nDe Ferran offered Norris advice when the British driver getting used to life in F1, after joining the championship in 2019.\n\n\"He helped us a lot. He said I was going to win a race in the next couple of years and I managed to do that, so a big shout out to Gil as well,\" said Norris.\n\n\"My dad probably wishes he came here! But this was for my family, not just my mum and dad.\n\n\"I've travelled a lot, I spend a lot of time away. They have helped me since the very beginning - my brother, my sisters, my grandparents, it's all for them.\"\n\nFormula 1 heads to Europe as Imola returns to the calendar following last year's cancelled race.

Instead of being salty about finishing P2 behind the McLaren driver, Verstappen hails him as his successor in the years to come.\n\nSpeaking to the Dutch media (as sourced on X), Verstappen revealed that he wants Norris to compete for regular race wins moving forward.\n\n\"If someone has to beat me, it can be Lando [Norris].\"\n\nMcLaren executed a perfect strategy in Miami, which was also aided by Verstappen's misfortune. The Dutch driver entered the pits after damaging his front wing on a cone, just moments before a Safety Car came out.\n\nThe latter provided Norris with a virtually free pit-stop which also allowed him to stay ahead of Verstappen. Norris kept his cool and didn't make any mistakes for the remainder of the race, grabbing his first-ever F1 win in the process.\n\nWhile Verstappen was very happy for Norris and even showed his admiration for the McLaren driver on social media, his own performance did not leave him smiling.\n\nBattling balance issues for the majority of the race, Verstappen finished in P2, 7.6 seconds behind the race winner. He conceded that it wasn't the best of days for him or Red Bull.\n\nAfter the race, Verstappen revealed that he had floor damage to his RB20. He hit a cone and carried it after his incident on the turn 14/15 chicane, and this affected his pace a lot.\n\nVerstappen was unaware of the floor damage until his team found it out after the race. However, he did know about the problem with his front wing.\n\nOverall, the RB20 lacked pace compared to Norris' car, and issues with tire grip (which affected his pace all weekend), led to understeer making him uncomfortable on the track.\n\nRegardless, Verstappen doesn't take anything away from Norris' win. He brought the spotlight back on the 24-year-old, insisting that he deserved to win the race.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_gopal_srivastava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Naman Gopal Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understeer_and_oversteer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Understeer and oversteer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/3f0c515a-f1-2024-05-06t110225.191.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Lewis Hamilton claimed his best result of the season, crossing the line sixth.\n\nNorris, who has emerged as one of the grid's brightest stars following his debut as a teenager in Melbourne in 2019, has so often been the nearly-man.\n\nJust last month, he became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to finish on the podium 14 times, having never taking to the top step. And in China a fortnight ago, he drove brilliantly only to finish runner-up to Verstappen.\n\nBut the race here in Miami - with former United States president Donald Trump a visitor in the McLaren garage two hours before the lights went out - belonged to Norris.\n\nVerstappen cruised to sprint victory on Saturday, and then secured his sixth pole in as many rounds and looked on course for a comfortable win when he nailed the start to assume the lead.\n\nHe also escaped damage when he clattered into a red and white traffic bollard at the chicane on the 22nd lap.\n\nVerstappen pitted a lap later for new tyres to relinquish the lead but the race dramatically turned on its head - and in Norris' favour - with 30 laps remaining when Haas driver Kevin Magnussen clattered into the back of Logan Sargeant.\n\nNorris had assumed the lead of the race by virtue of not stopping for tyres and when the safety car was deployed to retrieve Sargeant's damaged Williams, Norris was handed a golden opportunity.\n\nWith the chasing pack neutralised, Norris dived in for his only change of rubber to keep hold of his lead. Not only was he at the sharp end of the pack, but he had fresher tyres to boot, too.\n\nAfter four laps, the safety car peeled in, and Norris' nerves were put to the test with Verstappen, in his superior Red Bull machine, breathing down his neck.\n\nVerstappen followed Norris on the 180mph drag to the opening corner, but the British driver put his papaya orange machine on the apex of the right-hander to keep the Dutchman at bay.\n\nNorris then turned in the fastest lap of the race so far to establish a one-second lead over Verstappen, crucially putting him out of DRS-reach.\n\nSuddenly the improbable looked possible with Norris continuing to increase his margin. One second became two, which became three and with 10 laps to go he was four seconds clear.\n\nNorris' mind might have cast back to Sochi in 2021 when a late downpour and a refusal to switch to wet tyres cost him the win.\n\nBut the contrast could not have been greater here under clear blue skies in the Sunshine State as Norris came of age to take the flag, raising both hands in the air as he crossed the line.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car",

He was quickly followed by third-place man Charles Leclerc, two-time champion Fernando Alonso, Mercedes' George Russell and more.\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, the list was long. This was a popular victory for a popular driver but also one that everyone recognised had been too long in coming, and was well deserved.\n\nHeading into the Miami weekend, he held the all-time record for podium finishes without a win. Inevitably, then, there were those who were beginning to utter doubts as to whether Norris would ever stand on the top step. But only people who didn't properly recognise Norris' qualities doubted him.\n\n\"I wasn't worried,\" Norris said, \"and I knew my time was coming.\"\n\nNorris is the son of a millionaire stock market trader. But his talent has been obvious from a very early age, and the closer he got to F1 through his junior career, the more it became obvious he was marked out for great things.\n\nAged 18, early in 2018, Norris was team-mate to Alonso at the Daytona 24 Hours sportscar race. It was hardly the point of their appearance, but Norris set himself a private target of leaving the event with a faster lap time than Alonso - and did it.\n\nAt the time, Norris was McLaren's F1 reserve driver and Alonso was racing for them. Later that year, after McLaren had said they would promote Norris from reserve driver to their race team for the 2019 season, the Briton generated a few laughs in a wet practice session at the US Grand Prix in Austin by playing the boy and taking Alonso a cuppa while everyone waited for the track to dry.\n\nBut it did not take long once he was into a full-time F1 seat for Norris to shed the image of an apprentice. He went toe-to-toe with Carlos Sainz in their two seasons together and gave nothing away.\n\nHe came close to a win in Russia in 2021, when he put the McLaren on pole and led most of the race confidently before mistakenly choosing to stay out on dry-weather slicks when it rained late on.\n\nSainz left for Ferrari at the end of 2020 and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, then a seven-time race winner for Red Bull.\n\nThe talk before the partnership started was of how the pressure was all on Norris to prove he could match up. But from the off it was Norris who was the quicker driver.\n\nWhen McLaren finally achieved the win that cemented their re-emergence as a front-running team after a few difficult years, it was Ricciardo who took it, on a rare strong weekend in Monza. Norris was quicker, but he'd qualified a place behind.\n\nAnd when Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen crashed out together and left the McLarens running one-two, Norris dutifully followed team orders not to fight with his team-mate.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Daytona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "24 Hours of Daytona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_F1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren F1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_orders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team orders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/e4e3/live/b4e5b890-0b39-11ef-a7a0-13f4491c64ec.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

And it came at the expense of his friend Verstappen who failed to win for just the second time so far this season.\n\nThe Brit was helped to do so by the timing of a safety car period. It was called out when Logan Sargeant crashed, not long after Verstappen had pitted to yield the lead to Norris, who was yet to stop.\n\nThat afforded the McLaren driver a cheap pit stop and meant he was still leading when the race resumed. With fresh tyres and an upgraded car, he was able to pull away from the Red Bull and finally secure his first F1 win at the 110th attempt.\n\nIt is difficult to predict whether Norris would have had the pace to beat Verstappen had he not been able to take the lead with help from the safety car. When asked for his thoughts, the Dutchman directed the question to his rival.\n\n\"I don't know what the gap was, to be honest, before the safety car. How far were you behind me?\" he asked Norris, who replied: \"It would have been tough. I would have had to overtake two Ferraris, a Red Bull, Oscar [Piastri]. Oscar was doing a very good job, so hats off to him.\"\n\nAnd that was when Verstappen rather bluntly pointed out that it really doesn't matter. He said: \"I mean, it's always if, if, if, right? If my mum had balls, she would be my dad. So, yeah. I mean, it's how it goes to racing. Sometimes it works out for you, sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nIn response, Norris looked away from Verstappen and buried his face in his arm before hunching over as he laughed. And Charles Leclerc next to them was also giggling along with several members of the media in the room.\n\nIn the same press conference, Verstappen took the time to heap praise on his friend Norris. He said: \"I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today. He definitely deserved it. He was just miles faster at the end there. So, yeah, it's great. You know, winning your first race is always, I think, quite emotional.\n\n\"It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards Formula 1, and then you dream of being on the podium, but then being on the top step. So, yeah, of course, I'm not very happy with my day, but you can appreciate and respect what Lando has done today, and I'm very happy for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32745908.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Norris was exceptional, he took some good fortune from the timing of a safety car but then had to deliver for 24 laps with flawless precision, as the triple world champion Verstappen loomed in his mirrors.\n\nNorris not only held his nerve but demonstrated, as he has made clear in the past, he has no fear of taking on Verstappen as long he is in a straight head to head fight. This was the moment and Norris had to deliver through perhaps the most intense, pressurised, 24 laps of his life.\n\nIt has been some time coming, the debut win for the 24-year-old from Glastonbury was taken at his 110th grand prix after he made his debut at the Australian GP in 2019. He has claimed eight second places and might have had a win in Russia in 2021 only to be unlucky with late rain but he has repeatedly demonstrated the skill and verve to compete with the best at the very front.\n\nFor Norris then, who has long shown exceptional promise, this was the vindication for a driver who is much admired. Verstappen had looked to be in control out front until the race was turned on its head around the mid point. McLaren had taken a chance on leaving Norris out long before his pit stop and from where he inherited the lead.\n\nVerstappen had pitted on lap 24 and when Logan Sargeant crashed out, tangling with Kevin Magnussen on lap 29, it prompted a safety car under which Norris gained a free stop, ensuring he emerged once more in the lead from Verstappen.\n\nHe duly held his lead at the restart on lap 33 as Verstappen struggled to bring his tyres up to speed and Norris opened a gap with his fresher rubber but it was impossibly tense as the British driver put in a series of flawless laps he knew were vital.\n\nA series of fastest laps followed, they began ticking away and as unlikely as it seemed, Verstappen it appeared had nothing more to bring, complaining he lacked grip. For once it was Norris in complete command at the front, delivering on what he has always said he could do.\n\nThe safety car had fallen in his favour but Norris held his nerve with an absolute iron will to close out like a champion. The lead grew as the laps counted down until he took the flag and a historic first victory by 7.6 seconds from Verstappen.\n\nHis laughter and shrieking celebration from the cockpit was exultant and he was sportingly clapped by Lewis Hamilton as the seven-time champion drew level with him on the in-lap.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much. We did it Will,\" he bellowed to his race engineer Will Joseph. \"I guess that's how it's done, finally. I knew it when I came in in this morning, I said today is the day for opportunities. Thanks Mum, thanks Dad, this one's for my Grandma.\"\n\nHe then threw himself upon his team, crowdsurfing into their welcoming arms.\n\nThe crowd too stood to acknowledge his feat with absolutely raucous approval. For three years the fans have been coming to the track which winds its way round the Hard Rock stadium in Miami Gardens and they have yet to see anyone but Verstappen take victory here. That the Dutchman's stranglehold was broken by a driver so popular in the US and in making history as he did so was the sporting drama they appreciated with enormous acclaim.\n\n\"I am very happy for Lando it's been a long time coming and its definitely not going to be his last one, he deserved it today,\" said Verstappen, who nonetheless extended his lead in the title race to 35 points from Red Bull teammate P\u00e9rez who was fifth.\n\nBy the time the champagne was flowing, that the fans had a good time was palpable. Finally a new winner in Miami and proof positive there is a place for bopping about in a bikini while quaffing cocktails in F1 just as there is a place for standing in a waterproof in sheets of rain on a grassy knoll at Spa, as long as there is a great show on track and for the first time both Miami and Norris delivered in spades in that department.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were third and fourth. Sergio P\u00e9rez was fifth for Red Bull, Hamilton and his teammate George Russell sixth and eighth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda seventh for RB, Fernando Alonso ninth for Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon tenth for Alpine.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giles_richards@theguardian.com", "name": "Giles Richards", "type": "author",

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first

(AP) - Lando Norris needed 110 starts and a mistake by Max Verstappen to earn his first ever Formula 1 race on Sunday and end Verstappen's dominance at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\n\"Five seconds?\" Norris radioed his team. \"Am I alive?\"\n\nIndeed he was as an ecstatic McLaren squad celebrated a rare victory on a weekend in which it debuted significant upgrades on its two cars.

The Dutchman, who had won Saturday's Sprint event and led the early stages of the Grand Prix, also cut the chicane on lap 22 and struck a plastic bollard, with Red Bull saying the incident cost him some performance.\n\nBehind the top two, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc rounded out the top three, with teammate Carlos Sainz fourth after overtaking Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri, who subsequently needed to pit for a new front wing, ruining his chances of points.\n\nVerstappen's teammate Sergio Perez had a low-key run to fifth place, ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in sixth.\n\nYuki Tsunoda had a fine drive to seventh in his RB, with Hamilton's teammate George Russell following in eighth.\n\nFernando Alonso took ninth for Aston Martin, and Esteban Ocon scored the beleaguered Alpine squad's first point of 2024 with tenth place.\n\nDespite being beaten to victory, Verstappen extends his lead in the Drivers' Championship and now has 138 points.

Hey! Max Verstappen didn't win the Formula 1 race today! Instead, it was Lando Norris -- the guy who previously held the record for most podiums without a win. You can't say that about him anymore, though. Now, he's a winner.\n\nNorris put up a monster effort in his McLaren at the Miami Grand Prix. He started the race in P5 alongside his teammate Oscar Piastri on the third row, and at the beginning, it looked like Verstappen might've been reeling in another easy victory. The Red Bull lead man was dominant during the 57-lap contest's first half, but a safety car threw a wrench in his plans when Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant collided.\n\nFrom there, Norris exited the pits and rejoined in the lead. Boy, did he take advantage of that. He accrued fastest laps like they were nothing, inspiring the F1 Twitter meme machine to churn out a few gems:\n\nThe final 24 laps were Lando's as he built quite a gap in front of Verstappen -- more than six seconds toward race's end. There were concerns that backfield scuffles might create even more chaos as Norris' teammate Piastri fought hard, first colliding with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and nearly touching with fellow Australian Daniel Ricciardo. At that point, McLaren radioed in to say, \"Oscar, a reminder, Lando is leading the race, we do not want to cause a safety car here.\" Piastri would go on to finish 13th.\n\nWith Norris' W, he stands on the top step for the first time after 110 career F1 starts. He's the series' first new winner since George Russell at Interlagos in 2022, and alongside former teammate Sainz (who's done it twice), he's the only non-Red Bull driver to take a Grand Prix in the past 18 months. Fortunately for Norris, he didn't have to get his appendix taken out just weeks beforehand.\n\nWhile it feels questionable to say this season is more exciting than the last few that Verstappen dominated, we've at least seen three different manufacturers win through six races in 2024: Red Bull, Ferrari, and McLaren.\n\nMost everyone had great things to say about Norris and his triumph, obviously including himself and his team:\n\nEven Verstappen gave a nod on the cooldown lap:\n\nMax and Charles Leclerc rounded out the podium, giving Lando the appropriate soaking with champagne.

What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\"\n\n\"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\"\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\"\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull, it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former US President Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday, it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in Miami had little impact on the drivers' standings as Verstappen continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over Perez.\n\nMercedes' seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso grabbed ninth, while Esteban Ocon earned struggling Alpine their first point of the season crossing 10th.\n\nStarting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark, Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car.\n\nVerstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead.\n\nWith the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break.\n\nWilliams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right?\"\n\n\"Today was just a bit tricky. If a bad day is P2, I take it.\"\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\" - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"},

Now, that the dust has settled on his maiden victory in F1, the McLaren driver may have to fulfill his vow.\n\nIn an unearthed video, Norris is seen walking through McLaren Technology Centre's halls. He takes a glance outside the large windows, and sees the huge artificial lake, adjoining the campus. The man filming this video asks Norris if he would ever consider swimming there, to which Norris says no without hesitation.\n\nHowever, upon learning that Lewis Hamilton too, took a dip in the pool during his McLaren days, Norris changed his answer. The 24-year-old said,\n\n\"I guess when I get my first win, then.\"\n\nIt took 110 attempts, but Norris is finally a race winner. He won the 2024 Miami GP, finishing 7.6 seconds ahead of second-placed Max Verstappen. After a timely safety car that allowed him to pit and retain the lead of the race, the Briton did not look back and cruised to the chequered flag.\n\nLabeled as one of F1's most talented drivers today, Norris' win was a long time coming and he may now have to jump into the lake in front of his team's base.\n\nThe man who jumped into the pool before, Lewis Hamilton, was one of the first to congratulate Norris after his incredible victory in Florida last weekend.\n\nHamilton, a former McLaren driver, admitted that he was happy to see the Woking-based outfit on top again. The last race they won was back in 2021, and Norris brought that wait to an end.\n\nAfter the race, Hamilton told the media that he urged Norris not to fly out of Miami on Sunday evening like he was initially scheduled to. \"I honestly feel so happy for Lando. I just told him, he needs to stay tonight,\" said Hamilton.\n\nThankfully for Norris and McLaren, the team's CEO Zak Brown had good news for them. He told Norris during the latter's interview that the whole team would stay back in Miami to partake in celebrations.\n\nNorris made the best use of McLaren's upgrades at the Miami GP. With Ferrari too, ready to bring changes to the next race in Imola, the battle for P2 (potentially P1), could turn out to be more exciting than witnessed in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "somin_bhattacharjee@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Somin Bhattacharjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Technology_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren Technology Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/987d067c-lando-norris-happy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

After 15 podium finishes, Norris managed to win his very first F1 race on Sunday, May 5.\n\nAt the start of the Miami GP, Verstappen was leading the race while Norris was down in sixth. On lap 22, Verstappen accidentally hit the bollard on turn 15, which caused damage to his floor, something Red Bull were unable to detect during the race. He pitted for a tire change while Norris continued to stay on track and take the lead.\n\nOn lap 28, there was a clash between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant, which brought out the safety car. Just before the safety car was deployed, Norris entered the pits for a tire change, giving him a massive advantage.\n\nFrom that point onwards, Verstappen continued to struggle with his damaged car, giving the McLaren driver a chance to win his first F1 race of his career.\n\nSpeaking at the post-race press conference, Max Verstappen was asked whether Norris could have won the race without getting a free pit stop during the safety car. The Red Bull star replied that there are a lot of 'ifs' in a race and hilariously said:\n\n\"I mean, it's always if, if, if, right? If my mum had balls, she would be my dad. So, yeah. I mean, it's how it goes to racing. Sometimes it works out for you, sometimes it doesn't,\" Verstappen joked.\n\nMax Verstappen shares his views after finishing second in the 2024 F1 Miami GP\n\nMax Verstappen also spoke finishing second in the 2024 F1 Miami GP, a rare instance for him and the sport of late.\n\nSpeaking to F1TV right after the race, he explained how he was surprised to see how quick the McLaren lap times were and outlined his struggles on the medium tires.\n\n\"You win, you lose. We're all used to that in racing, right? Today was a bit tricky. I think already on the medium [tires] it didn't feel fantastic, we were pulling away but not like it should be. Then once we made a pit stop I heard what the lap times McLaren were doing and I was like, 'Well, that's pretty quick!',\" Verstappen said.\n\nVerstappen praised Lando Norris for driving well after he went on to hard tires and congratulated him on his first F1 race win.\n\n\"Once then they also switched onto the hard tire, they just had more pace, especially Lando he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint but if a bad day is P2, I take it.

He ended it the King of Miami, finally breaking his Formula One duck at the 111th attempt to spark wild celebrations at McLaren. And across the sport.\n\nWhat a day. For Norris first and foremost. The 24 year-old has for some time been a race-winner-in-waiting. But he has suffered so many near-misses - Sochi 2021, when he stayed out on dry tyres as rain fell in the final laps, and he was caught at the death by Lewis Hamilton - he must have felt cursed at times.\n\nThe sight of the young Briton leaping over the parc ferme barriers into the arms of his ecstatic mechanics, being hoisted onto their shoulders in tears, before wrapping McLaren chief executive Zak Brown and team principal Andrea Stella in big bear hugs, showed just how much this meant to him. And to the team. McLaren have been to rock bottom and back since Lewis Hamilton won their last world title back in 2008. The Woking team are starting to look seriously competitive once again.\n\nNorris was clearly still in shock by the time Jenson Button approached him with a microphone for the pre-podium interviews. \"About time eh? F***\"! he replied when asked how it felt to be a race winner, at long last. \"Sorry! But yeah it's been a long time coming. I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\"\n\nWhat a day, too, for Formula One as a whole. Three-time world champion Max Verstappen may still be cruising towards a fourth successive world title - the Dutchman did not lose much ground here, finishing second to claim 18 points and extend his lead over Sergio Perez in the drivers' standings to 35 points. But maybe, just maybe, we are going to have a fight from here on in.\n\nMcLaren arrived at this race with a significant upgrade package; a new front wing, new front suspension geometry, a revised front-brake duct and winglet, a completely revised floor and new bodywork and engine cover. And by the looks of it, it works.\n\nNorris's pace was evident when he almost took pole for Saturday's sprint race. And although he needed a helping hand in Sunday's main feature race, a safety car coming out at an opportune moment from his perspective, he thoroughly deserved the win, pulling away from Verstappen over the final laps to win by 7.6secs. It was the first time Verstappen had been beaten on track in over 20 races.\n\n\"Woooooo! Wooooo!\" Norris screamed over his radio as he took the chequered flag, thanking his team and particularly his race engineer Will Joseph. \"Oh my ------ ----! I love you all. I love you so much. We did it, Will! We did it! Finally!\n\n\"I knew it when I came in this morning. I nailed it. You nailed it. Thanks Mum, thanks Dad. This one's for my grandma. Thank you very much.\"\n\nPerhaps it was written in the stars for McLaren to win this race given the presence of Donald Trump as their guest at this race. Orange was certainly the colour of the day.\n\nBut the truth was you could feel it coming all week. McLaren were on the front foot throughout, Brown throwing some jabs at Red Bull and Christian Horner over the impending exit of Adrian Newey, saying he was unsurprised the engineering supremo was leaving given he was a \"man of integrity\" and predicting it might cause a \"domino effect\" of departures from that team.\n\nNorris, meanwhile, did the Lie Detector feature on Sky Sports F1 and told them he would win a race this season. \"I'm fed up of not believing so I changed my attitude,\" he said. The machine said he was telling the truth.\n\nHeading into the race Norris held the record for the most podiums without a win (15), as well as sharing the record for most second-place finishes without a win (eight) with Nick Heidfeld. And it looked as if his optimism might have been in vain when he lost a place at a frantic start.\n\nBut the safety car which came out following a collision between Haas' Kevin Magnussen and Williams' Logan Sergeant on lap 28 proved a gift. Norris, who had not yet stopped, was able to dive into the pits for some fresh rubber while marshals cleared the debris, and still come out ahead of his rivals, who had pitted earlier.\n\nAnd when the race restarted on lap 33, Norris was unstoppable on the hard tyre. By lap 34 he was out of DRS range at 1.3 seconds. By lap 44 the gap was had risen to 3.5 seconds and Norris was setting fastest laps.\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix has not built the best reputation from a racing perspective. Its critics hate the fact that it's a celebrity zoo more concerned with generating social media traffic then good racing. But in its defence, this was an entertaining race, with some wonderful battles up and down the field. Oscar Piastri's fight with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz for fourth was a particular highlight. The Australian picked up some damage in the process, dropping him to last, and there was an amusing moment when his team had to tell him to cool his jets as he fought his way back through the field.\n\n\"A reminder Lando is leading the race. We do not want to cause a safety car!\"\n\nFortunately, he did not. Norris held on for a thoroughly deserved win. Exactly 30 years on from the death of one McLaren legend, might we have witnessed the birth of another? It is far too early to make comparisons with Ayrton Senna, of course. But Norris is off the mark.\n\n\"I'm just proud really,\" he reflected. \"I mean a lot of people doubted me along the way, I've made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career but today we put it altogether so this is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and today proved exactly\n\nOn Lando Norris winning:\n\nDonald Trump was in the McLaren garage before the race, so will he take any credit for Lando's win? Here is with Lando after the race:\n\nOn his message for McLaren:\n\nYou beaty Lando! He comes home to win the Miami Grand Prix to take his first win in Formula One! The first of many!\n\nLando has just one lap remaining. You can do it Lando. He has over seven seconds on Verstappen.\n\nNorris is nearly seven seconds clear of Verstappen and he is getting closer and closer to his maiden win in F1. Keep going Lando!\n\nRicciardo is putting Albon under pressure for 15th and into turn 11 Albon locks up and goes way too deep, losing numerous places.\n\nPiastri has been told on his team radio that with Lando in the lead not to cause a safety car by taking too big a risk with an overtake.\n\nThere are just five laps remaining. Here are the current top five with gaps:\n\nA glimpse into the McLaren garage shows some nerves with Lando just over five laps away from a first win in F1. Come on Lando! Everyone is cheering on Lando and it will be such a popular win. Lando's lead over Verstappen is now over six seconds.\n\nThe stewards are going to investigate the incident between Sainz and Piastri after the race.\n\nNorris is just 10 laps away from his first win in F1. His lead over Verstappen is now over five seconds. This is a phenomenal performance from Lando.\n\nNorris is driving brilliantly in his quest for a first win in Formula One. He is now nearly four seconds ahead of Verstappen.\n\nThey have been fighting hard for the last few laps and Sainz gets past Piastri into turn 17. Sainz goes deep and there is a small amount of contact between Piastri's front wing and Sainz's rear wheel. Piastri gets back past Sainz with DRS down the main straight but Piastri goes deep so Sainz takes fourth back.\n\nPiastri has damage to the front wing and is overtaken by Perez and Hamilton into turn 11. Piastri is forced into the pits to change his front wing. As we are not long after the safety car, Piastri drops to the back. Such bad luck for Piastri.\n\nNorris is driving superbly here and sets a new fastest lap of the race. He is now two seconds ahead of Verstappen and has the advantage of younger tyres.\n\nBehind Sainz has been calling over the team radio for Piastri to give him the position after the battle at turn 11 but rightly so the stewards have decided no further investigation is necessary.\n\nSainz tries to go around the outside of Piastri at turn 11 but the Australian holds firm. Norris has got more than a second ahead of Verstappen so has crucially got out of the DRS range.\n\nWe are back racing. Norris stays ahead of Verstappen into turn one.\n\nInto turn 11 Leclerc looks like he is going for an audacious move up the inside of Verstappen but he pulls out as he is not close enough.\n\nK-Mag received plenty of penalties during the sprint yesterday and he now has a 10-second penalty for that crash with Sargeant.\n\nThe safety car is coming in at the end of this lap.\n\nThe safety car has come at a brilliant moment for Norris and McLaren as he comes in and out still in first place.\n\nSargeant and Magnussen have collided in turn three which brings out the safety car. The McLaren pit crew are out for Norris but he has gone past the pits. Crucially for him he gets past the Safety Car before it emerges from the pits so this could be massive for Norris.\n\nThe current top two both come into the pits so Norris inherits the lead. Verstappen is up into second and Leclerc in third. Piastri's tyres are nearly 10 laps younger than Leclerc's.\n\nNorris has just set a new fastest lap of the race and is now just over two seconds behind Sainz, who is just under three seconds behind current race leader Piastri.\n\nThe Dutchman comes in just after the VSC ended and changes to the hard tyre. He was worried about his front wing after hitting the bollard but Red Bull do not change the front wing. Piastri inherits the race lead as Verstappen is now in fourth after his stop.\n\nVerstappen has to cut the chicane at turn 15 as he gets out of shape and he hits the bollard. The virtual safety car comes out to pick up the debris that was on the track. But it does not last long so the frontrunners do not have the time to come into the pits under the VSC. A few of the runners further down like Fernando Alonso do come in though.\n\nNow that Norris has got free air, he has got permission from his team to go after Sainz. The gap between Sainz in fourth and Norris in fifth is four and a half seconds.\n\nFerrari have brought Leclerc into the pits to put the hard tyre on. He comes back out onto the track in sixth, just ahead of Russell crucially for Ferrari.\n\nRed Bull bring Perez in, with Norris putting him under huge pressure. Norris is therefore sent into free air whilst Perez comes out in tenth place on the hard tyre.\n\nRed Bull have told Verstappen to pick up the pace as Piastri is around three seconds behind the current race leader, showing good pace.\n\nHis teammate Norris is putting Perez under pressure for fifth place.\n\nIt seems unlikely a number of drivers will be able to execute a one-stop as Hulkenberg and Gasly are the latest to change tyres, onto the hards.\n\nThat Albon stop has set of a chain reaction as Stroll, Sargeant and Bottas all come in to change tyres.\n\nMeanwhile Russell has got past Hulkenberg into turn 11 and he is up into eighth place.\n\nWe are only just over ten laps into the race but we have the first pit-stop in the shape of Williams' Alex Albon. We think it will be a one-stop race but Albon will have to take his hard tyres nearly 50 laps.\n\nThe stewards have decided that there is no further investigation necessary for Perez regarding a possible false start.\n\nLewis had plenty of fights with a Haas yesterday in the sprint in the shape of Magnussen and he is fighting with Hulkenberg at the moment. Hulkenberg has re-passed Hamilton after a huge lock-up by Lewis at turn 17.\n\nThe Mexican is currently being investigated for a potential false start.\n\nCarlos Sainz has told his team he believes Perez should be receiving a penalty for flying up the inside of turn one on the opening lap. Yesterday in the sprint Hamilton did exactly the same but the stewards decided not to penalise Hamilton.\n\nTalking of Lewis, he has just got past Hulkenberg into turn 11 and into seventh place.\n\nPiastri gets DRS down the back straight and into turn 17 he gets the move done on Leclerc. The Ferrari driver does get DRS down the main straight but Piastri holds onto second place.\n\nVerstappen is over a second ahead of Leclerc so the Monagasque does not have DRS, but behind him Piastri does. This has been a terrific start from Piastri, who started sixth.\n\nThe seven-time world champion is under pressure in the early stages as he is on the slower hard tyres. Hulkenberg goes around the outside of Hamilton at turn one and gets the move done. He is up into seventh place.\n\nVerstappen holds first after a good start and Leclerc is unable to put pressure. There is a huge lock-up from Perez, who nearly goes piling into the back of his teammate. Piastri is the one who makes major gains as he is up from sixth to third. Super start from the Australian.\n\nWe are under way in Miami.\n\nWe are expecting a one-stop race today. Most drivers are starting on the mediums, but the only driver in the top ten who is not is Lewis Hamilton, who starts on the hard tyres. We have a few hard and soft tyres towards the back of the grid.\n\nThe drivers are now making their way around on the formation lap. We are just moments away from lights out.\n\nThe many, many celebrities on the grid are going to have to get off the track to make way for the main attraction. We are just five minutes away from lights out in Miami.\n\nThe stars are out in Miami and here is Sky's Martin Brundle speaking to popstar Camila Cabello.\n\nWill.i.am and Camila Cabello are two of many celebrities in attendance in Miami. But you feel most of the attention will be on Donald Trump.\n\nAs has been the case at every Grand Prix so far this season, Max Verstappen will start on pole for today's Miami Grand Prix. The Red Bull driver secured his seventh straight pole position, dating back into last season, and he made it six poles out of six to start the 2024 season. Despite taking pole, Verstappen was not entirely happy with his car.\n\n\"We definitely improved the car a bit,\" Verstappen said. \"I don't know what it is, every single year we come here, I find it extremely difficult to be consistent with the car feeling, the tyre feeling over one lap. It's super hard to make sure that Sector 1 feels good, then Sector 3 at the end of the lap. To make that happen together is incredibly tough.\n\n\"Again today, it was about finding that balance. I think we did OK. It wasn't the most enjoyable lap of my career because of how slippery it is and you're not very confident on the lap. But we are on pole, and that's the most important thing.\"\n\nVerstappen's seven straight poles takes him to within one of Ayrton Senna's all-time record of eight. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start on the front-row alongside Verstappen, which mirrors the front row from the sprint yesterday. Leclerc's teammate Carlos Sainz starts in third with Sergio Perez fourth. The McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri line up alongside each other on the third row. They are followed by the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton on the fourth row, with Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda rounding out the top ten. Both Aston Martins failed to get out of Q2.\n\nBefore qualifying took place yesterday, we had the sprint which Verstappen won from sprint pole ahead of Leclerc. Norris and Stroll had to retire after an incident at turn one which also involved Fernando Alonso and Hamilton. Mercedes failed to score a point in the sprint as Hamilton received a 20-second penalty for a pitlane infringement.\n\nThe race gets under way at 9pm BST.

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to

Credits: Image - Getty Images, video - Sky Sports\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris capitalised on a bit of good fortune to win the Miami Grand Prix on Monday (NZ time), holding off Red Bull's triple world champion Max Verstappen for his first Formula One victory.\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for the Briton who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), having finished runner-up an agonising eight times in 110 grand prix.\n\nVerstappen had seemed well placed to claim a fifth win in six races until a midway crash allowed McLaren to cash in on a safety car period, with Norris pitting and coming out with the lead.\n\nSeeking a Miami hat-trick of wins, the Dutchman filled Norris's mirrors on the restart but his Red Bull could offer no challenge as the McLaren pulled clear.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc completed the podium, coming home third ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz.\n\n\"About time! What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\n\n\"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\"\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the grand prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over his team mate Sergio Perez, who finished fifth.\n\nMercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nStarting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Norris's McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car.\n\nVerstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead.\n\nWith the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break.\n\nWilliams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right?\n\n\"Today was just a bit tricky. If a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2024/05/motorsport-mclaren-s-lando-norris-claims-maiden-f1-victory-with-win-in-miami/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1714952179159/Norris-1120-getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

And he did so by beating Verstappen in a straight fight on track - albeit with a little help from the timing of a safety car.\n\nIt allowed Norris to take the lead of the race at the mid-way point. But he still needed to hold off the Red Bull behind him when the race resumed and, not only did he do that, but he beat Verstappen by more than seven seconds in the end.\n\nThe Dutchman knew he had been beaten fair and square by Norris - his best friend in the F1 paddock. And he showed how happy he was for the McLaren racer by putting his thumb up to the 24-year-old as he pulled alongside his car on the cool down lap.\n\nThe footage was not broadcast on the TV world feed at the time. But a clip of the touching moment later emerged on social media and fans were left impressed by the way the championship leader handled the defeat.\n\nOne wrote: \"A fab gesture applauding for Lando for his first F1 race win! Great sportsmanship, Max!\" Another praised him for swallowing his pride after being \"knocked by that result\", while several others said the move was \"classy\".\n\nAnd many also pointed out that he wasn't the only one who did it. Lewis Hamilton was another driver who applauded Norris from the cockpit of his car, as did several others - showing just how popular the McLaren driver is among his peers.\n\nIn the post-race press conference, Verstappen took time to heap praise on Norris. He said: \"I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today. He definitely deserved it. He was just miles faster at the end there. So, yeah, it's great. You know, winning your first race is always, I think, quite emotional.\n\n\"It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards Formula 1, and then you dream of being on the podium, but then being on the top step. So, yeah, of course, I'm not very happy with my day, but you can appreciate and respect what Lando has done today, and I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nAnd Hamilton also congratulated his fellow Briton, telling reporters: \"I feel really happy for Lando... Such a special moment to win your first Grand Prix and obviously I started at McLaren, so really happy to see them back at the top. It's been a long time.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He went in there and pumped his clenched fists and wished them luck before the 57 laps began. And tried to rub off a bit of his self-belief on his hosts.\n\nThe papaya man visiting the papaya team.\n\nAnd, as if by magic, Lando Norris won his first race on a sunlit day in Miami. A little bit of luck came into it, for sure, in the shape of a safety car. But for Norris, 24-year-old racer from Glastonbury, Somerset, a whole heap of relief lifted from his slender shoulders, becoming the 21st British winner.\n\nHe carried with him the unwanted tag of 14 podiums without a victory, more than anyone else in history, and one sensed it weighed him down. He is more introspective than his bubbly, made-for-Netflix public demeanour suggests.\n\nLando Norris claimed his first victory in Formula One at the Miami Grand Prix\n\nThe British driver is congratulated by former president Donald Trump following his win\n\nThe McLaren driver kept his composure to best favorite Max Verstappen (left)\n\nHis big chance came on lap 28, almost the exact half-point of the race.\n\nThis was brought about by Haas' Kevin Magnussen punting Williams' Logan Sargeant into the wall. Sargeant, from up the road in Fort Lauderdale, was unlucky. Anyway, the cessation in racing allowed Norris a free stop. It gifted him the chance to hold on to hitherto deceptive 'lead', for he hadn't yet stopped and everyone else had.\n\nNice one. But who was in the car directly behind him? No less than his best mate on the grid, Max Verstappen, the world champion, the machine who can't be beaten (not unless his engine blows).\n\nPrivately, Norris rates Verstappen the best driver the sport has known. He believes he has every attribute to succeed at the top, so to have the Dutchman in a sizzling Red Bull in his rear-view mirror when the safety car pulled in was hardly akin to a quiet Sunday drive.\n\nIt must have put the wind right up him. Now all he had hoped for before and after his debut in Melbourne in 2021 - a spotty teenager who pulled at his finger joints nervously as he spoke - ran through his mind.\n\nCould he keep his calm? The early evidence was 'yes'. He was shod on younger rubber, obviously, but the same hard compounds. He immediately set a fastest lap and continued to edge ahead, while Verstappen was struggling. He made his complaints known over the radio. Thirteen laps to go and he had opened up a four second lead.\n\nNorris is psrayed with champagne by Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (right)\n\nWith his victory in sunlit Miami, the 24-year-old became the 21st British F1 winner\n\nIt was perhaps written in the stars. Verstappen, usually as dominant as imaginable, had managed to run into a bollard early on.\n\nThe triple world champion veered off track at Turn 15 a third of the way and collected the red-and-white cone. But at this point you would be thinking that nothing - plastic, human or extra-terrestrial - could stop the Dutchman as he dominates all he comes up against routinely.\n\nThat Norris won was testament to his talents, and built on his impressive performance, perhaps his most rounded in China a fortnight ago, when he was runner-up.\n\nAll this Norris joy had seemed a distant fantasy in the early stages. Verstappen had sat on the lead, no problems at all, keeping McLaren's Oscar Piastri at a distance behind him of three seconds in the searing Floridian heat. But Verstappen was not romping away, actually, a sign of what was to come.\n\nI don't know that you'd call this race swanky. It's too brash for that. Which was a perfect place for the politician who may be elected the next leader of the free world while inside a prison cell.\n\nOn Monday the great new Norris fan will be in a New York courtroom fighting charges that he falsified documents to cover up hush money he gave to a former adult-film actress and a Playboy model. Yet Sunday he was the main attraction even amid the A-listers who came (and those who stayed away perhaps because of him).\n\nWith his race, Norris claimed McLaren's first victory in nearly three years\n\nVerstappen, usually as dominant as imaginable, had managed to run into a bollard early on\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the Miami Grand Prix and was flanked by heavy security\n\nIn a surreal scene some two hours before lights out, his security men called for a channel to be made taking him from the central paddock building to the McLaren garage. Someone shouted: 'Hope you win, Donald!' He turned and said: 'I have to.'\n\nHe went into the garage for 10 minutes or so. He spoke to the sport's top brass, including Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali and FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem. He was in the McLaren stable at the request of the team's majority owners, the Bahrain sovereign wealth fund led by the Crown Prince of the kingdom, Salman.\n\nThe conversation over, Trump then went through the same routine through the throng. An OnlyFans model, whose skimpy attire left little to the imagination, took a selfie with the Republican candidate presumptive. He jutted his jaw and off he stalked followed by his security detail.\n\nHe had not entirely got his own way this week. A billionaire friend, Steven Witkoff, had tried to organise a fundraiser at the track. The idea was to charge attendees $250,000 to attend the function on a Paddock Club rooftop suite.\n\nThe organisers stamped that out.\n\nBut Trump watched from the same spot as Norris took the win, a massive 7.6 seconds from Verstappen, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc third. Norris put both hands in the air in celebration after crossing the line.\n\nColleagues at McLaren, who felt they had to underline they are non-political in a statement after the Trump visit, were overwhelmed. They danced in the pit lane.\n\nTrump gestured to his supporters in the crowd as he prepared to watch the racing begin\n\nTrump speaks with McLaren CEO Zak Brown as he visits the McLaren garage before the race\n\nLewis Hamilton, a McLaren world champion back in the day, gave Norris a thumbs up from the cockpit.\n\nNorris hollered a noise beyond description. 'We did it, Will,' he said to his engineer Will Joseph. Zak Brown, the McLaren chief executive who had entertained Trump in the garage, hugged everyone he could find.\n\n'I guess that's how it's done,' chimed a clearly emotional Norris, dedicating the triumph to his grandmother. 'I knew when I came in today it was a day of opportunities.'\n\nYes, he made himself great.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [],

Picture: REUTERS\n\nIt is doubtful there has been a more popular winner of a Formula One race in recent years than McLaren's Lando Norris, who was celebrated by everyone from Max Verstappen to Donald Trump after his victory at the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for Norris, who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), including an agonising eight runner-up finishes, in 110 grands prix, making the likable Briton easy to root for.\n\nEven Verstappen, Red Bull's triple world champion who hates to lose and was denied a hat-trick of Miami wins by the McLaren driver, was among the first to congratulate Norris, who was mobbed by his team, crowd surfed along pit land and drenched in a shower of champagne.\n\n\"It was a long time coming, and I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today,\" smiled a genuinely pleased Verstappen. \"He definitely deserved it.\n\n\"It's great winning your first race. It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage before the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after, and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He [Trump] said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris' mother and father were ecstatic, though they were not in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out, it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them.\n\n\"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son -- seven-times world champion Lewis -- also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest.\n\nWorld champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130.\n\nNorris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more. We'll keep our heads down and keep pushing.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Webber_(racing_driver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Webber (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hamilton_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenson Button"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Rosberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lrOdFW9LRQvLMtQs2-0-nB9wT_HDhmbWH_2-ZDh5i2nrgTHH6W5VN3T-scJFF4hkTDlcK0wxV6DQVvIR0coWIVlPQtmuvJc3ZixlpQ-ZEblRDA=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

If a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando.

Norris had been questioned over his ability to win a race, but he's finally put those doubts to bed.\n\nAs Lando Norris finally overcame his winning duck, securing his first-ever race victory at the Miami Grand Prix, it was not only to the delight of McLaren fans, or the drivers on the track, who serenaded him with rounds of applause as they came over the finish line, it was to the obvious delight of himself and his team, as visor cam footage paired with the audio of the team radio makes for some very wholesome listening as Lando \"No-wins\" is no more.\n\nDriving in his 110th race of his career, Lando Norris decided that the Miami GP was the time and place to put in the performance fans knew he had in him. Having come close at the Russian GP in 2021, it was a change in conditions that ultimately led to him not getting his first victory, but with the Miami sun glaring down on him, he showed up and showed out in convincing fashion, beating Max Verstappen to victory with a seven-second lead on the Dutch champion.\n\nThere had been a lot of talk regarding Norris, and if he had it in him to compete for victories, especially following the GP in China, where he topped qualifying, only for Lewis Hamilton to snatch that position off him following Turn 2 on race day. However, the \"No-wins\" moniker is no more, and the delight of the British driver and his team was palpable, with radio footage proving just how badly they had been waiting for this moment.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: The Miami GP was Lando Norris' 110th start in a Formula 1 race.\n\nLando Norris' Team Radio Footage After Miami GP\n\n\"Woooo, about f****** time! I love you all, I love you all, thank you so much, we did it!\"\n\nHaving taken the time to relish in the fact that he was an F1 race winner, the McLaren driver delivered a lovely speech to his team over the radio, saying: \"Everyone in McLaren, I've finally delivered for you, thank you so much, I'm so proud of everyone, of our work, let's keep it up, let's keep fighting. This is just the beginning. Love you all.\"\n\nHe was then jokingly asked if he was crying over the radio, something he denied, but whether he was crying or not, the emotion and pride was evident on the audio, and it is obvious just how badly he wanted to dispel the myth that he couldn't win, or that he couldn't handle the pressure.\n\nMiami Grand Prix 2024 Top 5\n\nPosition\n\nDriver\n\nCar\n\nPoints\n\n1.\n\nLando Norris\n\nMcLaren\n\n25\n\n2.\n\nMax Verstappen\n\nRed Bull\n\n18\n\n3.\n\nCharles Leclerc\n\nFerrari\n\n15\n\n4.\n\nCarlos Sainz Jr\n\nFerrari\n\n12\n\n5.\n\nSergio Perez\n\nRed Bull\n\n10\n\nLando Norris Reacts to First GP Win\n\nClearly with a point to prove, Norris took to the press conference after his win to speak about the critics who doubted him: \"... a lot of people doubted that I could go out and win races and perform under the pressure of leading the race, especially with Max behind you and those types of things. But really, this year, I felt more confident than ever that I wasn't thinking of these things.\"\n\nClose\n\nThe response of a true winner. It is clear Norris has had a shift in mindset in recent times, with this confidence and energy not being observed way back in 2021 at the Russian GP. This is the evolution of a driver who is ready to handle the pressure. With the next GP taking place in Italy, it will be interesting to see if Norris can keep up this form and cement himself as someone who will be there or thereabouts come race day.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-09-04-am-1890.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

'But then I moved to quad biking. I was a big fan. Then I really got into motorcross.'\n\nNow he is one of the most successful F1 drivers both on and off the racetrack.\n\nNot only does he have a four-year contract estimated to be worth a whopping \u00a380 million, the racing pro has a series of luxury brand deals and has starred in a number of glam photoshoots.\n\nClutching onto a series of supercars, designer watches and a stunning \u00a320million mansion in Surrey. As well as career success, his personal life has also been blossoming.\n\nLando Norris reached new heights as he entered the Formula One history books with a first Grand Prix win\n\nNorris is amongst Formula One's most-popular drivers and promotes a luxury lifestyle on his social media accounts\n\nLando Norris was recently spotted with Margarida Corceiro at the Monte-Carlo Masters final\n\nLando and his millionaire businessman father Adam Norris arrive at the Bahrain Grand Prix in March\n\nOver the past year, he has ben regularly spotted alongside the ex-girlfriend of Barcelona footballer Joao Felix, Portuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro, only add to speculation and discussion about his romantic life.\n\nThe pair were recently spotted at the Monte-Carlo Masters final amid her split from Felix last year. Norris and Corceiro were first spotted together last May in a video on social media showing the 24-year-old driving his Fiat Jolly with her in the back of the classic car.\n\nNorris had previously been dating Luisinha Oliveira, with the McLaren driver beginning a relationship with the Portuguese model at the start of 2022.\n\nThe relationship ended in September that year, with Norris confirming the split on social media.\n\nHow Red Bull's departing mastermind can reignite Lewis Hamilton's career at Ferrari... PLUS why a Grand Prix in 'woke' Los Angeles is off the agenda, writes JONATHAN MCEVOY\n\nFact-box text\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many of the F1 elite, Norris grew up in an affluent family, living in the rural town of Glastonbury, Somerset.\n\nHe is the second son of multi-millionaire businessman Adam Norris - who has amassed a \u00a3205 million fortune - and his mother Cisca, from Belgium.\n\nNorris is one of four children - having an elder brother called Oli, and two younger sisters Flo and Cisca.\n\nHe attended school in Somerset but ultimately left without any GCSEs in pursuit of a career in support, later studying physics and maths with the help of a personal tutor.\n\nNorris became the youngest go-karting world champion at just age 14 - a title previously held by Lewis Hamilton.\n\nIt was during his time on the go-karting scene that he was talent-spotted by McLaren who were impressed by the record breaking youngster.\n\nNorris became the youngest-ever British Formula One driver when he made his debut in the competition in 2019 at just 19-years-old at the Australian GP after coming through the ranks of the garage as an FP2 star.\n\nTeam principal Zak Brown once called an even-more youthful Norris to his office in 2019 to tell him the news that he was being given a contract and full-time seat in Formula One, telling him at the time: 'Welcome to Formula One.'\n\nNorris was drencehd in champagne atop the podium by Red Bull's Max Verstappen (left) and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (right)\n\nPhotography appears to be one of Norris' favourite hobbies during his spare time\n\nBarcelona forward Felix had been dating Portuguese model and actress Corceiro since 2019\n\nThe Englishman took the news calmly at the time and has taken to the on and off-track demands that being one of the world's biggest sporting celebrities brings with it.\n\nFormula One's media moguls have wrangled their product as being the glitzy and most glamorous event as their recent success in Miami showed and Norris is central to their image - and McLaren's.\n\nThe energetic and motor-obsessed babyface of the sport has never looked unnerved by driving for McLaren and settled quickly in the sport, making podiums along the way but always falling short until passing the chequered flag first on Sunday.\n\n110 starts for McLaren finally came to their best moment yet in the season's seventh race of the calendar and Norris can now look to soaking in the American sunshine while toasting a first glorious GP victory.\n\nHis age and combined millionaire status make celebrations a grander affair with Norris renowned for occasions where even recently he got injured accidentally while playing around partying.\n\nA night out in Amsterdam, Holland ahead of the Miami event saw Norris sustain a gruesome facial injury and was pictured sporting a cut on his face while on board a boat in the Dutch capital, having seemingly revelled in the King's Day celebrations.\n\nImages quickly circulated on social media showing Norris, 24, with a bloodied bandage stretched across his face - although he appeared in good spirits.\n\nAny signs of pain born from that injury were quickly doused in champagne by Red Bull's, Verstappen and Ferrari driver Charles LeClerc on the podium as the three celebrate and toasted to their success.\n\nNorris is an avid sports lover away from the racetrack and indulges in a busy lifestyle\n\nLando Norris was first spotted with Corceiro in Monaco in May 2023 via social media\n\nNorris shares a close friendship with Red Bull's F1 reigning world champion Max Verstappen (left)\n\nMarks of Norris' face injury suffered while partying in Amsterdam in the build-up to race weekend could be seen while he celebrated\n\nNorris ended his 110-race wait for a first Grand Prix victory by winning in America on Sunday\n\nNorris' popularity amongst his fellow competitors was evident more than ever to see at the end of the race as he embraced several drivers with whom he has become close-friends with over the years of lining up on the track alongside one another.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell - who finished eighth overall in Miami - put his arm around Norris as the pair enjoyed a brief moment of friendly conversation together amidst the chaos of post-race procedures and celebrations.\n\nFormer McLaren team-mate and now-RB Formula One Team driver - Daniel Ricciardo - was also pictured looking delighted while sharing a lengthy hug with Norris in the pits.\n\nMcLaren chief, Brown, looked like a father full of pride when he roughly grabbed Norris and hugged his star driver who has finally delivered grand prix success for the team with a stunning win against the odds.\n\nAway from the track and once he has had time to revel in celebrations Stateside, Norris will likely return to Monaco and try to settle back in his usual routine where he leads a sports-obsessed lifestyle aimed at bearing success.\n\nNorris' social media channels shows he is a lover of fast-growing sport Paddel and golf, where he strikes a unique fashion sense as he takes time away from racing.\n\nNorris and McLaren team principal Zak Brown (left) shared an emotional hug after his win\n\nNorris has quickly become a figurehead for McLaren to put their faith into as his Miami victory proves\n\nNorris met with former United States president Donald Trump who is currently trying to rally support ahead of this year's election\n\nNorris starred for McLaren as he passed the chequered flag first at an eventful race in Miami\n\nNorris and his close-friend and Mercedes star George Russell shared a warm brief interaction after his win\n\nThe riches of his McLaren contract reward him with up to \u00a320million-a-year, while his ever-growing profile as a rising social media star - where he often collaborates in videos with celebrity YouTubers - brings further endorsements give him the luxuries you'd expect from a F1 superstar.\n\nSpeaking to Jenson Button after the race yesterday he said: 'About time. F***! Sorry! What a race! It's been a long time coming. Finally, I've managed to do it.\n\n'I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. The whole weekend has been good. I've had some little setbacks along the way but I knew on Friday we had the pace.\n\n'Thanks to, everyone. I'll give a shout-out to my mum and dad of course.' Sky quickly apologised after the interview for Norris' hilarious x-rated outburst.\n\nHis time in Formula One is still relatively only at it's beginning and while much has been discussed about Norris' wait for a first victory, much should also be expected from his future as the Brit begins to purr inline with McLaren's improvements that are making them more competitive with each and every passing race.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person",

It was a cool moment.\"\n\nNorris had started to earn the reputation as F1's nearly man prior to his victory in the Sunshine State.\n\nA fan heckled Norris in Australia in March after the McLaren man became the first driver in the sport's history to stand on the podium as many as 14 times without taking to the top step.\n\n\"When are you going to win a race Lando?\" yelled the punter. Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media.\n\nNorris said after his Miami success: \"I never lost the faith. I never lost the belief that I could go out there and do it.\n\n\"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I love it. More than anything, it makes me smile - especially (the meme) 'Lando No-wins'.\n\n\"So to prove those people wrong and to prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, and then go out and do it, has put an even bigger smile on my face. I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris was propelled on to the road to glory when Kevin Magnussen punted Logan Sargeant off the track and a safety car was deployed, allowing the British driver to stop for new tyres.\n\nAnd Norris - boosted by a significant McLaren upgrade - held his nerve at the restart to keep title favourite Max Verstappen behind before finishing nearly eight seconds clear to provide hope that he could yet offer a challenge to the Dutchman in his all-conquering Red Bull machine.\n\n\"I said at the beginning of the year we could win a race and lot of people doubted that,\" added Norris, who will be back in action at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola on May 19.\n\n\"I am not sure I would have won today without the upgrades and without the hard work that the team has been putting in. But I would like to say it's the start.\n\n\"Now I'm already hungry for more. We'll keep our heads down, we'll keep pushing, and I'm sure we can be here a lot more often.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenorthernecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Northern Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "northern_echo@thenorthernecho.co.uk", "name": "Northern Echo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/resources/images/18047870/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2711, "textEnd": 2717}], "sentiment": 0.7019607843137254, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Even Verstappen, Red Bull's triple world champion who hates to lose and was denied a hat-trick of Miami wins by the McLaren driver, was among the first to congratulate Norris, who was mobbed by his team, crowd surfed along pit land and drenched in a shower of champagne.\n\n\"It was a long time coming, and I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today,\" smiled a genuinely pleased Verstappen. \"He definitely deserved it. \"It's great winning your first race. It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm. \"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He (Trump) said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris's mother and father were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment. \"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them. \"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\" Anthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven-times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest. World champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130. Norris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more.

But he took full advantage and beat the Red Bull for pace in his upgraded McLaren.\n\nIt is the first time Verstappen has been beaten in a race he has finished since last year's Singapore Grand Prix, won by Carlos Sainz. And Norris ' success will give everyone on the grid, not just himself, the confidence of knowing that Red Bull can be beaten in a straight fight.\n\nMcLaren were showing good pace but Verstappen led the race fairly comfortably for the first half. Norris inherited the lead temporarily after the Dutchman, along with Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, pitted for new tyres.\n\nBut he was able to grab a cheap pitstop when Kevin Magnussen took out home hero Logan Sargeant at half distance. The Williams was buried into the barrier which required work from the marshals and so the race was neutralised, presenting the Briton with his chance.\n\nHe would have been worried when the safety car picked up Verstappen instead of him - the whole pack had to be let through so that Norris could be the lead car before the race could get going again. And that presented everyone behind him with the chance to light up their tyres.\n\nBut he still had the grip to hold off Verstappen when the green flags were waved. And once he had made sure of the lead he never looked back, breaking the DRS barrier in time to make sure the Red Bull wasn't able to open its rear wing.\n\nPrevious experience left everyone feeling it may be inevitable that Verstappen would close in. But as each lap ticked by the gap between them grew rather than shrunk - Norris was in the groove and the championship leader was getting flustered.\n\nHe hasn't been happy with the grip he was getting from the rear end of his car all weekend. And he was again on the radio complaining about the balance of his car, as it dawned on him that he was going to be beaten.\n\nWith 10 laps left, Norris' had stretched out his advantage to five seconds. And with each completed trip around the Miami track he was making it more and more comfortable, before letting out a cheer of equal parts elation and relief as he finally achieved his boyhood dream and became a Formula 1 race winner.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_reduction_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag reduction system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32742322.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media.\n\nNorris said after his Miami success: \"I never lost the faith. I never lost the belief that I could go out there and do it.\n\n\"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I love it.

I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris was propelled on to the road to glory when Kevin Magnussen punted Logan Sargeant off the track and a safety car was deployed, allowing the British driver to stop for new tyres.\n\nAnd Norris - boosted by a significant McLaren upgrade - held his nerve at the restart to keep title favourite Max Verstappen behind before finishing nearly eight seconds clear to provide hope that he could yet offer a challenge to the Dutchman in his all-conquering Red Bull machine.\n\n\"I said at the beginning of the year we could win a race and lot of people doubted that,\" added Norris, who will be back in action at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola on May 19.\n\n\"I am not sure I would have won today without the upgrades and without the hard work that the team has been putting in. But I would like to say it's the start.\n\n\"Now I'm already hungry for more.

And that presented everyone behind him with the chance to light up their tyres.\n\nBut he still had the grip to hold off Verstappen when the green flags were waved. And once he had made sure of the lead he never looked back, breaking the DRS barrier in time to make sure the Red Bull wasn't able to open its rear wing.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It's been a long time coming and it's going to be the first of many.\n\n\"Maybe it's also a bit of relief for him that he has that win now, who knows what's going to happen next?

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to

Photograph: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for Norris, who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), including an agonising eight runner-up finishes, in 110 grand prix making the likeable Briton easy to root for.\n\nIMAGE: Republican Presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of the Miami Grand. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nEven Verstappen, Red Bull's triple world champion who hates to lose and was denied a hat-trick of Miami wins by the McLaren driver, was among the first to congratulate Norris, who was mobbed by his team, crowd surfed along pit land and drenched in a shower of champagne.\n\nIMAGE: McLaren driver Lando Norris (4) celebrates with his team after winning the F1 Miami Grand Prix at Miami International Autodrome. Photograph: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\n\"It was a long time coming, and I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today,\" smiled a genuinely pleased Verstappen. \"He definitely deserved it.\n\n\"It's great winning your first race. It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He (Trump) said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris's mother and father were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them.\n\n\"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven-times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest.\n\nWorld champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130.\n\nNorris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more. We'll keep our heads down and keep pushing.\"\n\nIMAGE: Donald Trump alongside FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

His breakthrough came in 2020 with a maiden podium, followed by more podiums in subsequent seasons, including a near-victory in Russia 2021.\n\nHe outshone his more experienced teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, consolidating his position as a force to be reckoned with in Formula 1.\n\nBeyond the racetrack, Norris exudes a humble charm and displays his artistic flair by designing and painting his own racing gear as a personal hobby.\n\nPhotographs curated by Manisha Kotian/Rediff.com", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [],

What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally, I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\n\n\"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\"\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull, it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former US president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the Grand Prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over his Perez.\n\nMercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso grabbed the ninth while Esteban Ocon earned struggling Alpine their first point of the season crossing 10th.\n\nStarting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car.\n\nVerstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead. With the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break.\n\nWilliams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right?\n\n\"Today was just a bit tricky.

His father is reported to be one of the wealthiest people in Bristol, who made money working as a pensions manager and then running electric scooter business pure electric. Lando is also part Belgian, with his mother hailing from the Flanders region.\n\nThe driver tried his hand at various sports growing up but he especially took to go-karting. He soon worked his way up, eventually becoming the youngest driver to take part in the F1 championship.\n\nAfter stepping out of the machine that carried him to victory on Sunday, Norris put down his yellow crash helmet before running and leaping into the arms of his mechanics. They hoisted him into the air as a host of drivers - including fellow Briton George Russell and Daniel Ricciardo, the last man to win for McLaren in Monza in 2021 - came over to congratulate Norris.\n\n\"About time, huh,\" said Norris, who was interviewed by 2009 world champion Jenson Button. \"What a race. It has been a long-time coming. Finally I have managed to do it. I am so happy I have delivered for the team. I am finally on top. I am over the moon.\n\n\"I am proud. The whole weekend has been good. I have had some little setbacks along the way. I knew we had the pace, and today we put it together.\"\n\nJust last month, Norris became the first driver in F1's 74-year history to have finished on the podium as many as 14 times without winning.\n\nAnd in China a fortnight ago he drove brilliantly, only to finish runner-up to Verstappen. However, the race here in Miami belonged to the driver who made his debut as a teenager in Australia in 2019.\n\nHe continued: \"What do I say to McLaren? I am just proud. I guess people doubted me along the way, and I have made mistakes over the last five years, in my short career, but I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris was a popular winner, with Lewis Hamilton, who finished sixth, slowing down on his in-lap before taking both hands off the steering wheel to congratulate his countryman.\n\n\"Lando was flying,\" said Verstappen after he finished 7.6 seconds behind Norris. \"I am very happy for him. It is not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it today.\"", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_stenson@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Mary Stenson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millfield", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flanders"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Flanders"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glastonbury"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glastonbury"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenson Button"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i2-prod.devonlive.com/incoming/article9266854.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Norris' strategy was to have him run far longer than those who were running ahead of him in the hopes of getting a safety car.\n\nWhen the Williams of home-town hero Logan Sargeant and the Haas of Kevin Magnussen came together on lap 28, he got his wish.\n\nNorris at that point had a 12-second lead over Max Verstappen. The safety car slowed the rest of the field down and allowed him to make his pitstop and keep the lead.\n\nNorris survived a brief challenge from Verstappen on the restart, but then drove calmly to eventually win by more than seven seconds.\n\nHe also dedicated the win to his grandmother, and the team's late sporting director Gil de Ferran.\n\nThe win came with former US president Donald Trump watching on from the McLaren garage.\n\nVerstappen and Norris are close friends off the track. Verstappen pulled up alongside Norris to congratulate him on the cool-down lap back to the pits.\n\nNorris is also a popular figure in the pitlane, and was congratulated after the race by most of the grid. Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur at one point even joined in the McLaren celebrations.\n\nThe win came in his 110th race.\n\nBut while the safety car was a blessing for Norris, it appeared to cost Ricciardo any chance of a strong result.\n\nHis RB team had elected to start him on the hardest of the three compounds, which would have allowed him to drive further into the race before making his pit stop. The theory is he would have been on a quicker tyre late in the race to make up places.\n\nBut the safety car meant those rivals were also able to make a stop and stay ahead, ruining Ricciardo's strategy. Teammate Yuki Tsunoda finished seventh, and now sits 10th in the drivers standings. Ricciardo is 14th.\n\nThe F1 season continues with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at the Imola track on May 19, only a fortnight after the 30th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death at the same venue.", "source": {"uri": "wwos.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "wwos.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_de_Ferran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gil de Ferran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayrton Senna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/ss96ilVrhFS63_q-AhOjDdh-em4=/0x218:4184x2571/0x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F707b9e4b-c3fc-4b38-9c46-0950d26439c9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2217, "textEnd": 2223}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He had inherited the lead after Red Bull's Max Verstappen made his.\n\nNorris came out in front of Verstappen, the two-time reigning winner of the 57-lap race around the 19-turn, 3.363-mile (5.412-kilometer) temporary street circuit around Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, and he pulled away after the restart to secure his first career victory.\n\nHe had been the all-time recordholder for most podium finishes without a win (15). Now he is one for 16, returning the record (13) to Nick Heidfeld.\n\nVerstappen finished the weekend with 26 points, compared to Norris' tally of 25. Verstappen won Saturday's 19-lap sprint race from the pole position to score eight points, while Norris was taken out in a first corner melee which saw questionable moves from both Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll.\n\nContact led to an opening lap retirement for Norris, who had qualified in a disappointing ninth place after topping the speed charts in both SQ1 and SQ2.\n\nThe 24-year-old Briton was still in position to score 26 points for the weekend with a Sunday victory. But thanks to teammate Oscar Piastri, that did not come to fruition.\n\nPiastri's defensive maneuver against Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. drew Sainz's ire. A few laps later, when Sainz finally made his move around the McLaren for fourth place, there was contact which damaged Piastri's front wing, forcing him to make an untimely pit stop.\n\nNow on new tires, Piastri took the fastest lap point off of his teammate. The move ultimately cost McLaren a point in the constructor championship, as Piastri was unable to actually score that point since he did not finish in the top 10. He had to settle for 13th place.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it was Verstappen whose championship lead grew from the start of the weekend to the end of it. He now owns a 35-point lead over teammate Sergio Perez, who has been unable to win either one of the two races Verstappen hasn't won through six starts this year. Norris still sits in fifth place in the standings, but he is now just 18 points outside of the top two.\n\nThe next race on the schedule is the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, which is scheduled to take place at Imola Circuit on Sunday, May 19. Imola did not host a race last year due to flooding. Verstappen is the two-time reigning winner of the race. Live coverage is set to be provided by ESPN2 beginning at 8:55 a.m. ET.

In doing so, Glastonbury-born Norris, then 19, became the first British teenager in F1 history.\n\nNorris boasted an impressive junior resume, and he looked at home in F1 - an instant match for the established Carlos Sainz in their two seasons together at McLaren before Norris effectively sent Daniel Ricciardo into early retirement after he wiped the floor with the eight-time winner in 2021 and 2022.\n\nBut unlike Hamilton in 2007, Norris was not thrust into a world championship-winning machine. And despite Norris' obvious talent - Red Bull have enquired on multiple occasions about his availability - his failure to win a race was beginning to cast a shadow over his career.\n\nNorris might have triumphed in Russia in 2021 before a late downpour rattled him. He should have switched to wet tyres, but both Norris and his McLaren team - by then almost a decade without a win - dithered, and Norris' victory disappeared before his eyes. Norris' race engineer Will Joseph admitted in Miami that he is still haunted by that afternoon on Sochi's Black Sea.\n\nIn Japan last September, Norris became the highest F1 scorer without a win. Fast-forward to Australia in March, and Norris was the bearer of more unwanted history - this time, becoming the first man ever to stand on the podium as many as 14 times without taking to the top step.\n\n\"When are you going to win a race, Lando?\" goaded a fan in Melbourne. Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media. He then became the subject of a meme: 'Lando No-wins'.\n\nAnother second place - his eighth in total - followed in China last month only for Norris' golden moment to finally arrive in his 110th appearance - a memory he will never forget, not least because former United States president Donald Trump was among the first to congratulate him.\n\nWhen a shy, possibly introverted, Norris entered F1, he would lock himself away in his hotel room, and play computer games. Not any more. Norris, an immensely popular figure in the paddock, arrived in Miami with a cut on his nose following a boozy boat party in Amsterdam with friends.\n\nNorris, linked to Portuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro, claimed the injury was caused when he inadvertently drunk from a broken bottle.\n\nAnd with the 24-year-old rearranging his travel plans - on the insistence of the team's CEO and his F1 father figure Zak Brown - to celebrate his landmark win in Miami, the British driver vowed: \"I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way. I might have more than a scratch on my nose!\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In doing so, Glastonbury-born Norris, then 19, became the first British teenager in F1 history.\n\nNorris boasted an impressive junior resume, and he looked at home in F1 - an instant match for the established Carlos Sainz in their two seasons together at McLaren before Norris effectively sent Daniel Ricciardo into early retirement after he wiped the floor with the eight-time winner in 2021 and 2022.\n\nBut unlike Hamilton in 2007, Norris was not thrust into a world championship-winning machine. And despite Norris' obvious talent - Red Bull have enquired on multiple occasions about his availability - his failure to win a race was beginning to cast a shadow over his career.\n\nNorris might have triumphed in Russia in 2021 before a late downpour rattled him. He should have switched to wet tyres, but both Norris and his McLaren team - by then almost a decade without a win - dithered, and Norris' victory disappeared before his eyes. Norris' race engineer Will Joseph admitted in Miami that he is still haunted by that afternoon on Sochi's Black Sea.\n\nIn Japan last September, Norris became the highest F1 scorer without a win. Fast-forward to Australia in March, and Norris was the bearer of more unwanted history - this time, becoming the first man ever to stand on the podium as many as 14 times without taking to the top step.\n\n\"When are you going to win a race, Lando?\" goaded a fan in Melbourne. Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media. He then became the subject of a meme: 'Lando No-wins'.\n\nWhen a shy, possibly introverted, Norris entered F1, he would lock himself away in his hotel room, and play computer games. Not any more. Norris, an immensely popular figure in the paddock, arrived in Miami with a cut on his nose following a boozy boat party in Amsterdam with friends.\n\nNorris, linked to Portuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro, claimed the injury was caused when he inadvertently drunk from a broken bottle.\n\nAnd with the 24-year-old rearranging his travel plans - on the insistence of the team's CEO and his F1 father figure Zak Brown - to celebrate his landmark win in Miami, the British driver vowed: \"I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way. I might have more than a scratch on my nose!\"", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/hcncXOyVxtGZuBTk2mcIyW_ON94=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/X44GOBPTB5HJBD3BDEFOXM4FGM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

So there were emotional scenes at the end of Sunday's Miami Grand Prix as the Briton celebrated winning in F1 for the first time.\n\nFist pumps and hugs with colleagues are common after any driver wins. But even these days it is rare to see drivers congratulate a rival with as much enthusiasm as many of them produced as they spoke with Norris.\n\nTo his credit, Max Verstappen put aside his own disappointment to be the first to heap praise on his friend. He said: \"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last one so yeah, he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nNorris also got big hugs from Fernando Alonso and Daniel Ricciardo, among others. And Charles Leclerc, who finished third, explained why there is so much love and mutual respect between this new generation of F1 stars.\n\nThe Ferrari driver said: \"I'm just very happy for Lando, as we all want to beat one another. It's always nice to see the emotions. We've all come up together, and we came up through. I saw him in KF3, and from there we always want to make it to F1, and then the first race is special, and he must celebrate it.\"\n\nBut there is another key reason for everyone not of a Red Bull persuasion to be delighted with the manner of Norris' victory. The way he put McLaren's upgrades to good use and sped away from Verstappen reminded everyone that the Dutchman is not invincible.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

And, speaking to media after the race, boss Christian Horner claimed his star driver had picked up damage when he hit a bollard.\n\nBut the reality is McLaren introduced a raft of car upgrades which improved their pace so much they could take on the Red Bulls and win. And with that success comes a flicker of optimism that it might be possible for teams to take the fight to the defending champions after all.\n\nAsked if he felt Norris' pace was indicative of McLaren being able to compete with Red Bull regularly, Verstappen simply replied: \"I hope not!\" Red Bull will want things to be business as usual at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix next time out - the other nine teams will pray for another McLaren challenge.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKJ_(karting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OKJ (karting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32742507.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AUTO-PRIX-F1-USA-PODIUM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The race turned on its head when an accident between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant forced a safety car to be deployed. Norris was one of the last drivers who hadn't made a pit stop at that point and was leading the race. He came back out with four fresh, hard-compound tires, still in the lead, and never looked back.\n\nMax Verstappen came in second place and challenged Norris on the restart, but never got close enough the remainder of the race. Charles Leclerc took third place, finishing just a couple seconds behind Max.\n\nLogan Sargeant was the only DNF of the day, as he was victim to the incident with Magnussen. Lewis Hamilton came home in sixth but was close to Sergio Perez (and quite pleased about it) right at end of the race. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo's magical weekend came to an end as his teammate Yuki Tsunoda outperformed him by a wide margin in the race, coming in seventh to Ricciardo's 15th.\n\nIn a press conference with media, Norris said \"it felt incredible\" at the top step of the podium. \"Just happiness, me smiling, which is not always the case, but I dream of these days sometimes, and you never know when they're going to come toward you, but today was that day,\" Norris said.\n\nHis closest competitors, Verstappen and Leclerc were both happy for Norris getting his first victory, too.\n\n\"I think it was a long time coming, and I'm very happy to be beated by Lando today,\" Verstappen said. \"He definitely deserved it and was miles faster in the end.\"\n\n\"I'm just really happy for Lando,\" Leclerc started. \"He needs to enjoy it as much as possible, and tonight will be a good night.\"\n\nOn the topic of celebrations, when queried, Norris made it clear that celebrations are in order.\n\n\"I'm not going to sleep,\" Norris laughs. \"I'm going all the way. There might be more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow,\" Norris said in reference to his nose injury sustained while partying in Amsterdam last week.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_not_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Did not finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i3.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/f1_grand_prix_of_miami-1024x576.jpeg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The Dutchman, who had won Saturday's Sprint event and led the early stages of the Grand Prix, also cut the chicane on lap 22 and struck a plastic bollard, with Red Bull saying the incident cost him some performance.\n\nBehind the top two, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc rounded out the top three, with teammate Carlos Sainz fourth after overtaking Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri, who subsequently needed to pit for a new front wing, ruining his chances of points.\n\nVerstappen's teammate Sergio Perez had a low-key run to fifth place, ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in sixth.\n\nYuki Tsunoda had a fine drive to seventh in his RB, with Hamilton's teammate George Russell following in eighth.\n\nFernando Alonso took ninth for Aston Martin, and Esteban Ocon scored the beleaguered Alpine squad's first point of 2024 with tenth place.\n\nDespite being beaten to victory, Verstappen extends his lead in the Drivers' Championship and now has 138 points.

Charles Leclerc finished third, while a grid penalty for Carlos Sainz dropped him to fifth with Sergio Perez moving to fourth.\n\nDespite failing to win, Verstappen led the congratulations from his rival as, one after another, they gave him a huge hug to celebrate his success. Verstappen heaped praise on the Brit and claimed he \"deserved it\" in his post-race interview, while Lewis Hamilton admitted he was \"so happy for Lando\".\n\nAfter receiving his winners' trophy and medal on the podium, Norris and McLaren celebrated with a team photo in front of the garage. Over 50 members of staff were present, including team principal Andrea Stella as McLaren toasted a first Grand Prix win of their own since Monza in 2021.\n\nHowever, after a number of different team photos were taken, bottles of champagne were popped and sprayed in the direction of Norris. Among those joining in the party were Ferrari boss Vasseur, who appeared from behind a photographer with a McLaren cap on his head before darting towards the celebrations.\n\nOnce he sprayed his bottle, Vasseur then walked over to pour any remaining last drop of alcohol near Norris and the McLaren media team. Despite both members of his team finishing third and fifth, Vasseur appeared to cut a delighted figure - like most of the circuit - for Norris.\n\nReacting to his success, Norris said: \"About time, huh? What a race. It's been a long time coming but finally I've managed to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team - I've finally delivered for them. It was a long day, a tough race, but I'm finally on top and over the moon.\"\n\nNorris was due to fly back to England after the race, but following advice from Hamilton, he confirmed himself that his flight had been changed to Monday so that he can toast his maiden victory.\n\n\"I was meant to fly [tonight], but Zak [Brown] just told me we fly tomorrow,\" Norris revealed. \"I'm not going to sleep - I'm going all the way! I might have just a scratch on my nose tomorrow, but I don't care. This only happens once, when you're taking your first win.\n\n\"It's nice that it was here at Miami - I was kind of hoping it would be at Silverstone but I'll try to do it there as well. Tonight is going to be a good night.\"\n\nVerstappen, who was beaten by the speed of Norris over the 57 laps, was gracious in defeat. \"If I get beaten, it's great that it has been done by Lando,\" the Dutchman said. \"He deserves it. It's been a long time coming and it's going to be the first of many.\n\n\"Maybe it's also a bit of relief for him that he has that win now, who knows what's going to happen next? But for sure they had a strong weekend. Maybe it was a little bit messy still [on Saturday] but today they were flying - and especially Lando was flying. So definitely very happy for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_king@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Kieran King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Champagne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stella_(engineer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stella (engineer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32745668.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_lando-cele.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally, I have managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\n\n\"Long day, tough race.

The Dutchman, who had won Saturday's Sprint event and led the early stages of the Grand Prix, also cut the chicane on lap 22 and struck a plastic bollard, with Red Bull saying the incident cost him some performance.\n\nBehind the top two, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc rounded out the top three, with teammate Carlos Sainz fourth after overtaking Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri, who subsequently needed to pit for a new front wing, ruining his chances of points.\n\nVerstappen's teammate Sergio Perez had a low-key run to fifth place, ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in sixth.\n\nYuki Tsunoda had a fine drive to seventh in his RB, with Hamilton's teammate George Russell following in eighth.\n\nFernando Alonso took ninth for Aston Martin, and Esteban Ocon scored the beleaguered Alpine squad's first point of 2024 with tenth place.\n\nDespite being beaten to victory, Verstappen extends his lead in the Drivers' Championship and now has 138 points. Perez remains second on 101 points, and Leclerc is third on 98.\n\nRed Bull remain top of the Constructors' Championship with 237 points. Ferrari are second with 189 points, with McLaren third with 127.\n\nThe seventh round of the 2024 F1 World Championship is the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola, Italy on May 19.", "source": {"uri":

It was a cool moment.\"\n\nNorris had started to earn the reputation as F1's nearly man prior to his victory in the Sunshine State.\n\nA fan heckled Norris in Australia in March after the McLaren man became the first driver in the sport's history to stand on the podium as many as 14 times without taking to the top step.\n\n\"When are you going to win a race Lando?\" yelled the punter. Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media.\n\nNorris said after his Miami success: \"I never lost the faith. I never lost the belief that I could go out there and do it.\n\n\"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I love it. More than anything, it makes me smile - especially (the meme) 'Lando No-wins'.\n\n\"So to prove those people wrong and to prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, and then go out and do it, has put an even bigger smile on my face. I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris was propelled on to the road to glory when Kevin Magnussen punted Logan Sargeant off the track and a safety car was deployed, allowing the British driver to stop for new tyres.\n\nAnd Norris - boosted by a significant McLaren upgrade - held his nerve at the restart to keep title favourite Max Verstappen behind before finishing nearly eight seconds clear to provide hope that he could yet offer a challenge to the Dutchman in his all-conquering Red Bull machine.\n\n\"I said at the beginning of the year we could win a race and lot of people doubted that,\" added Norris, who will be back in action at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola on May 19.\n\n\"I am not sure I would have won today without the upgrades and without the hard work that the team has been putting in. But I would like to say it's the start.\n\n\"Now I'm already hungry for more. We'll keep our heads down, we'll keep pushing, and I'm sure we can be here a lot more often.\"\n\nTwo Somerset boys were instrumental in McLaren's victory at the recent Miami Grand Prix, writes Matthew Adam.\n\nBoth Maclaren driver Lando Norris and Chief Designer Rob Marshall were born and educated in the County.\n\nDriver -Lando Norris (Born Bristol) studied at Millfield School and Chief Designer - Rob Marshall (born Taunton) studied at Taunton School.

I'm so happy for my whole team, I've finally been able to deliver for them. A long day, a tough race, but finally on top so I'm over the moon.\n\n\"The whole weekend has been good. I've had a few setbacks along the way. I knew on Friday we had the pace and just a couple of mistakes here and there but today we managed to put it together, we put the perfect strategy, it all paid off.\"\n\nMcLaren had brought upgrades to Miami, and Norris had shown genuine pace on his way to victory, crossing the line 7.6 seconds ahead of the previously dominant Verstappen. The Dutchman, who had won Saturday's Sprint event and led the early stages of the Grand Prix, also cut the chicane on lap 22 and struck a plastic bollard, with Red Bull saying the incident cost him some performance.\n\nBehind the top two, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc rounded out the top three, with teammate Carlos Sainz fourth after overtaking Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri, who subsequently needed to pit for a new front wing, ruining his chances of points.\n\nVerstappen's teammate Sergio Perez had a low-key run to fifth place, ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in sixth.\n\nYuki Tsunoda had a fine drive to seventh in his RB, with Hamilton's teammate George Russell following in eighth.\n\nFernando Alonso took ninth for Aston Martin, and Esteban Ocon scored the beleaguered Alpine squad's first point of 2024 with tenth place.\n\nDespite being beaten to victory, Verstappen extends his lead in the Drivers' Championship and now has 138 points.

He required a pit stop to assess his car's damage, which allowed Oscar Piastri to take the lead.\n\nAfter additional pit stops, Norris took his lead on lap 28 and never looked back. Kevin Magnussen bumped Sargeant's tire on the same lap, sending him into a wall and knocking him out of the race.\n\nThat crash put another safety car on the track. Norris held onto the lead while Leclerc attempted to overtake Verstappen.\n\nNorris increased his lead as Leclerc and Verstappen wrestled for position. Verstappen, who admitted to struggling with handling his car, eventually fell more than eight seconds behind the race leader.\n\nNorris (83 points) remains in fifth place in the driver standings, but is now just two points behind the fourth-place Sainz.

On the surface it is easy to get excited about the nature of his win given the one-sided championship season we have seen to this point and the ease with which the Dutchman has won the other four races he has finished in 2024.\n\n- Norris beats Verstappen in Miami GP for first F1 win\n\n- Watch Formula One on ESPN networks all season long\n\nEven more tantilizing was the fact Norris' victory -- his first in 110 F1 race starts -- came at the first attempt with the big upgrade package McLaren brought to the race, its first significant one of the year so far. Teammate Oscar Piastri will also have the new package for F1's next race, Imola's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix.\n\nWhile a new race winner will always prompt excitable statements about a new reality at the front, there were clear extenuating circumstances which helped end Norris' winless streak.\n\nThe collision between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant which prompted the Safety Car changed the course of the contest, rewarding Norris and McLaren for going long with the first stint. The Magnussen-Sargeant clash happened shortly after Norris had moved from fifth up to first as his rivals pitted. The British driver had been carefully managing his tyres in a bid to attack with fresh rubber later in the race.\n\nVerstappen provided a memorable soundbite when asked if McLaren could have still beaten him without the Safety Car.\n\n\"I mean, it's always if, if, if, right? If my mum had balls, she would be my dad,\" he said, prompting laughter from Norris and third-place Charles Leclerc alongside him in the post-race press conference.\n\nMcLaren felt like Norris' extended first stint would have left him with the pace to attack at the end of the race had there not been a Safety Car, although he was skeptical he could have made enough passes on track to win the race in that scenario.\n\n\"It would have been tough,\" Norris said on the hypothetical of a race without a Safety Car. \"I would have had to overtake two Ferraris, a Red Bull, Oscar [Piastri].\"\n\nThen there was the state of Red Bull's car all weekend, and notably Verstappen's during the race itself. Despite taking pole position for the sprint (which he won) and for the grand prix, Verstappen and Red Bull struggled to get their hands around the set-up of the car around the Miami circuit.\n\nVerstappen potentially complicated matters further when he went straight over the Turn 14/15 chicane, knocking over a cone in the process.\n\n\"I don't think we had a great balance all weekend,\" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said on Sunday evening. \"Obviously, he hit the bollard around Lap 20 and that has actually done quite a lot of damage to the underside of the car, so we will have to look at exactly what the effect of that was.\n\n\"It is a reasonable amount of the area around the left rear floor. There is a reasonable amount that's missing and you can see it awfully flexing as well, so it certainly wouldn't be helping.\"\n\nVerstappen himself made light of the incident -- joking \"I didn't like [the cone], so I decided to take it out and test the durability of the front wing as well!\" -- but downplayed Horner's suggestion it had a negative impact on his car's performance.\n\nRed Bull later explained Verstappen had not seen pictures of the car before going into the press conference. \"He lost two-and-a-half-tenths in Turn 1 every lap,\" Horner said. \"Whether that was because of the damage... when you actually see the pictures of what was missing, it wasn't designed like that.\"\n\nMcLaren came away from the weekend excited at the clear gains made with the upgrade and just with its pace in general. Raw lap times in the race had looked good. Even Piastri, driving in the \"old-spec\" McLaren without all the upgrades Norris had available to him, had looked competitive before a tangle with Carlos Sainz ruined his race. Team boss Andreas Stella played down the suggestion Norris' win was a sign of a new reality in F1 in the immediate future.\n\n\"I think yes, we improved the car,\" Stella said of the upgraded package. \"We know in the numbers how much we improved it. And it's material, you see it in lap time.\n\n\"But I think this race for Red Bull was a little bit of a struggle. So before we say the pace we saw today is a representative of the future, I'm not going to put my signature on this statement.\"\n\nThe race represented another feather in Stella's cap, having also orchestrated the huge turnaround McLaren achieved last year when it leaped from the back of the order to being Red Bull's closest rival on the back of one upgrade at the Austrian Grand Prix in June 2023. Another successful upgrade will only heighten the optimism and momentum which Stella has cultivated since stepping into the team boss role.\n\nIt will also serve as a reminder about just how tangible progress can be with the right development path.\n\n\"We take this positive, we take this encouragement,\" Stella added on Sunday. \"If anything it's even more energy to develop in my view, if you want to fight consistently Red Bull, we need to deliver another package like the one we have delivered here.\n\n\"In Japan we were sixth-tenths away in qualifying of Red Bull. In China we were a few tenths away. It would be completely unrealistic to think what we've seen here is the updated picture of competitiveness. I think here Red Bull didn't get the most out of their package.\"\n\nTeammate Piastri will get the same upgrade in two weeks as McLaren goes to Imola's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at full strength. Red Bull will still expect to be the benchmark team on pace, but McLaren's competitiveness will be a major talking point going into the next race.\n\nFans who were growing bored of seeing Verstappen cruise to victories most weekends can take comfort in the fact McLaren seems to be on a strong development path and that there are big steps forward still to be found under the current regulations.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austrian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0506%2Fr1329310_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It's always quite emotional. It brings you back to all the days that you worked towards your dream of being on the podium.\"\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm.\n\n\"He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,\" said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. \"He (Trump) said he was my lucky charm because it was my win, but I don't know if he's going to come to more races.\"\n\nNorris's mother and father were ecstatic, though they weren't in Miami to witness the moment.\n\n\"The cider's flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,\" Adam Norris told Sky Sports. \"I was working out it's probably about 900 races I've been to over the last 16 years.\n\n\"It's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in, supporting them.\n\n\"I counted out 350 weekends away and all the races on different weekends.\n\n\"It's brilliant. So happy for him.\"\n\nAnthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son - seven-times world champion Lewis - also texted Norris with congratulations.\n\nWhile Norris was long overdue for a maiden win his wait was not the longest.\n\nWorld champions Jenson Button needed 113 races before his first win and Nico Rosberg 111.\n\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez holds the record of 190 races before his visit to the top of the podium and it took Ferrari's Carlos Sainz 150 and Mark Webber 130.\n\nNorris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win.\n\n\"This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,\" said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. \"I would like to say it's the start, and now we're really hungry for more.

What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them.\n\n\"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\"\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the grand prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over his Perez.\n\nMercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso grabbed ninth while Esteban Ocon earned struggling Alpine their first point of the season crossing 10th.\n\nStarting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car.\n\nVerstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead.\n\nWith the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break.\n\nWilliams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right?\n\n\"Today was just a bit tricky. If a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando.

The Bristol-born 24-year-old stormed ahead of the Red Bull star in the final moments of the race on Sunday securing a narrow win for the McLaren team.\n\nNorris has perhaps always been destined for F1 greatness after becoming the youngster-ever British driver when he made his debut at 19-years-old in the Australian Grand Prix. Yet if it had not been for his love of horse riding as a child, the young star may never have made his way to motorsports. 'I started on horse riding, so I started on four legs,' he recalled previously. 'But then I moved to quad biking. I was a big fan. Then I really got into motorcross.'\n\nNow he is one of the most successful F1 drivers both on and off the racetrack. Not only does he have a four-year contract estimated to be worth a whopping \u00a380 million, the racing pro has a series of luxury brand deals and has starred in a number of glam photoshoots. Clutching onto a series of supercars, designer watches and a stunning \u00a320million mansion in Surrey. As well as career success, his personal life has also been blossoming.\n\nOver the past year, he has ben regularly spotted alongside the ex-girlfriend of Barcelona footballer Joao Felix , Portuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro (Pictured left), only add to speculation and discussion about his romantic life. The pair were recently spotted at the Monte-Carlo Masters final amid her split from Felix last year. Norris and Corceiro were first spotted together last May in a video on social media showing the 24-year-old driving his Fiat Jolly with her in the back of the classic car. Norris had previously been dating Luisinha Oliveira, with the McLaren driver beginning a relationship with the Portuguese model at the start of 2022.\n\nThe relationship ended in September that year, with Norris confirming the split on social media. Like many of the F1 elite, Norris grew up in an affluent family, living in the rural town of Glastonbury, Somerset. He is the second son of multi-millionaire businessman Adam Norris - who has amassed a \u00a3205 million fortune - and his mother Cisca, from Belgium. Norris is one of four children - having an elder brother called Oli, and two younger sisters Flo and Cisca. He attended school in Somerset but ultimately left without any GCSEs in pursuit of a career in support, later studying physics and maths with the help of a personal tutor.\n\nNorris became the youngest go-karting world champion at just age 14 - a title previously held by Lewis Hamilton. It was during his time on the go-karting scene that he was talent-spotted by McLaren who were impressed by the record breaking youngster. Norris became the youngest-ever British Formula One driver when he made his debut in the competition in 2019 at just 19-years-old at the Australian GP after coming through the ranks of the garage as an FP2 star. Team principal Zak Brown once called an even-more youthful Norris to his office in 2019 to tell him the news that he was being given a contract and full-time seat in Formula One, telling him at the time: 'Welcome to Formula One.'\n\nThe Englishman took the news calmly at the time and has taken to the on and off-track demands that being one of the world's biggest sporting celebrities brings with it. Formula One's media moguls have wrangled their product as being the glitzy and most glamorous event as their recent success in Miami showed and Norris is central to their image - and McLaren's. The energetic and motor-obsessed babyface of the sport has never looked unnerved by driving for McLaren and settled quickly in the sport, making podiums along the way but always falling short until passing the chequered flag first on Sunday. 110 starts for McLaren finally came to their best moment yet in the season's seventh race of the calendar and Norris can now look to soaking in the American sunshine while toasting a first glorious GP victory.\n\nHis age and combined millionaire status make celebrations a grander affair with Norris renowned for occasions where even recently he got injured accidentally while playing around partying. A night out in Amsterdam, Holland ahead of the Miami event saw Norris sustain a gruesome facial injury and was pictured sporting a cut on his face while on board a boat in the Dutch capital, having seemingly revelled in the King's Day celebrations. Images quickly circulated on social media showing Norris, 24, with a bloodied bandage stretched across his face - although he appeared in good spirits. Any signs of pain born from that injury were quickly doused in champagne by Red Bull's, Verstappen and Ferrari driver Charles LeClerc on the podium as the three celebrate and toasted to their success.\n\nNorris' popularity amongst his fellow competitors was evident more than ever to see at the end of the race as he embraced several drivers with whom he has become close-friends with over the years of lining up on the track alongside one another. Mercedes driver George Russell - who finished eighth overall in Miami - put his arm around Norris as the pair enjoyed a brief moment of friendly conversation together amidst the chaos of post-race procedures and celebrations. Former McLaren team-mate and now-RB Formula One Team driver - Daniel Ricciardo - was also pictured looking delighted while sharing a lengthy hug with Norris in the pits. McLaren chief, Brown, looked like a father full of pride when he roughly grabbed Norris and hugged his star driver who has finally delivered grand prix success for the team with a stunning win against the odds.\n\nAway from the track and once he has had time to revel in celebrations Stateside, Norris will likely return to Monaco and try to settle back in his usual routine where he leads a sports-obsessed lifestyle aimed at bearing success. Norris' social media channels shows he is a lover of fast-growing sport Paddel and golf, where he strikes a unique fashion sense as he takes time away from racing. The riches of his McLaren contract reward him with up to \u00a320million-a-year, while his ever-growing profile as a rising social media star - where he often collaborates in videos with celebrity YouTubers - brings further endorsements give him the luxuries you'd expect from a F1 superstar.\n\nSpeaking to Jenson Button after the race yesterday he said: 'About time. [expletive]! Sorry! What a race! It's been a long time coming. Finally, I've managed to do it. 'I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. The whole weekend has been good. I've had some little setbacks along the way but I knew on Friday we had the pace. 'Thanks to, everyone. I'll give a shout-out to my mum and dad of course.' Sky quickly apologised after the interview for Norris' hilarious x-rated outburst. His time in Formula One is still relatively only at it's beginning and while much has been discussed about Norris' wait for a first victory, much should also be expected from his future as the Brit begins to purr inline with McLaren's improvements that are making them more competitive with each and every passing race.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

It was a moment that had somehow evaded him during his previous 109 races in F1 and one that any driver needs to make the final step into the top echelon of the sport.\n\nSo as his McLaren continued to extend the gap over Max Verstappen's Red Bull in second place during the final lap, his thoughts started to focus on how to mark the occasion at the chequered flag.\n\n- Norris beats Verstappen in Miami GP for first F1 win\n\n- Watch Formula One on ESPN networks all season long\n\nWhat should he say on team radio that would fit the moment? What would sum up the emotions?\n\nAnd what would lay to waste the \"Lando NoWins\" nickname that has plagued his Instagram account since his last true opportunity of victory slipped through his fingers at the 2021 Russian Grand Prix?\n\n\"I was smiling and thinking, how am I going to celebrate? What am I going to say?\" Norris said after the race. \"I'm not very good at kind of just coming up with these things and improvising when that situation comes, so I was rehearsing my lines.\n\n\"But when I went over the line, I just turned into something else. I don't know what it is. It's just that you're happy.\n\n\"Once you cross the line, then you just let go.\"\n\nWhat came out sounded wonderfully unrehearsed -- a true burst of emotion, the sort reserved by the human body for occasions of pure ecstasy.\n\n\"WOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOO! About f------ time!\" he blurted to his race engineer. \"Finally! Finally! I'm so happy.\n\n\"I knew it when I came in this morning, I said today is the day of opportunity and I nailed it, and you nailed it.\"\n\nNorris may have had a good feeling when he arrived at the Hard Rock stadium on Sunday morning, but after the first lap of the Miami Grand Prix his optimism had waned.\n\nWhile teammate Oscar Piastri had vaulted up to third place in the mess created by Sergio P\u00e9rez's attempt to divebomb two Ferraris at the first corner, Norris had dropped from fifth on the grid to sixth.\n\nIt was still a step up on Saturday's sprint race start, in which he was wiped out in a multi-car collision at Turn 1, but as the first lap played out, any chance of a victory looked slim.\n\n\"I kind of had a little flashback to yesterday's sprint race when I saw Sergio on the inside,\" Norris said. \"I just thought, 'OK, let's try to make it around Turn 1 for once.'\n\n\"So I took it easy. \"I knew we had good pace, and I knew was in it for the long game. I was behind Checo [Perez] the whole of the first stint, but my pace at the end of the first stint was the best on track.\n\n\"And I could still see Max, and when you can see Max, there's hope. It's not often that you can see Max on track.\"\n\nThat hope still required a great deal of luck to be converted into a victory, and it came on lap 29 when a safety car was deployed to clear up the mess left by a collision between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant at Turn 2.\n\nOver the 12 laps prior to the safety car's deployment, Norris had passed all five of the cars ahead of him by virtue of them pitting while he remained on track. The timing of the safety car gave him a free pit stop, allowing McLaren to change his tyres and get him back on track before his rivals came round to complete another lap. It was a stroke of luck, but one that Norris felt no guilt in exploiting.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got to have a bit of luck on your side, and things have got to go your way, and I had that today,\" Norris said. \"I'll take it happily.\n\n\"And, yeah, after the safety car I could kind of just get my head down and push on and I was confident I could take it from there.\"\n\nThe celebrations that followed are due to stretch long into the Miami night. McLaren's CEO Zak Brown took the liberty of rescheduling Norris' evening flight home to allow him to make the most of the evening.\n\n\"I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way,\" he said. \"I'll enjoy my time. This only happens once when you're taking your first win. It's nice to do it here in Miami. I was kind of hoping it was going to be at Silverstone, but I'll try to do it there as well.\"\n\nIt's clear Norris will also take a great deal of satisfaction from proving his doubters wrong. Ever since the 2021 Russian Grand Prix when he lost the lead of the race after being caught out on slick tyres in a rainstorm, a narrative has grown around his lack of victories.\n\nIn 2022 and early 2023, McLaren's struggle for performance only made the missed opportunity in Russia more prominent. But since the mid part of last year, when McLaren rejoined the fight for regular podiums, it has seemed like a matter of time until Norris broke his duck.\n\n\"Realistically it was a bit of a weight on his shoulders, but it was some weight on our shoulders as well, because we knew as soon as we had made winning material available to Lando he would have delivered,\" McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said. \"So, we felt the responsibility and I said that many times.\n\n\"We feel like it's up to us, it's not up to Lando. But credit to Lando that he kept developing, how he developed over the winter, especially looking for instance at improving in qualifying and delivering laps that sometimes don't have to be 100% when you have a fast car. Just be there. And I think he's doing that.\"\n\nNorris said the doubters had only fuelled his desire to go out and win over the past few seasons.\n\n\"Never did I not believe in what I could go out and do,\" he said. \"So, I'm happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people who doubted me wrong.\n\n\"As much as I love to see it and I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me -- especially Lando NoWins, that's become the thing -- for me to finally prove those people wrong, it's put an even bigger smile on my face today. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nAs the victory soaked in, Norris also admitted it was a welcome weight off his shoulders.\n\n\"As much as I want to say no [it's not a weight off my shoulders], it's a yes. To get that first victory is always incredible.\n\n\"And I've, of course, I had my moments where we've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win.\n\n\"But I wasn't worried. As much as a lot of people doubted that I was going to be able to put it together and win a race, I wasn't worried.\n\n\"I've kind of been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes, and the team have got what it takes, and I was patient with it.\n\n\"I've just been doing my job and executing my races, executing my qualis, and doing what I can do best.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 Russian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-kart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go-kart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stella_(engineer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stella (engineer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_slick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racing slick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0506%2Fr1329127_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Norris replied with the middle finger and the unsavoury exchange was splattered all over social media.\n\nNorris said after his Miami success: \"I never lost the faith.

I thank all of them.\"\n\nNorris was propelled on to the road to glory when Kevin Magnussen punted Logan Sargeant off the track and a safety car was deployed, allowing the British driver to stop for new tyres.\n\nAnd Norris - boosted by a significant McLaren upgrade - held his nerve at the restart to keep title favourite Max Verstappen behind before finishing nearly eight seconds clear to provide hope that he could yet offer a challenge to the Dutchman in his all-conquering Red Bull machine.\n\n\"I said at the beginning of the year we could win a race and lot of people doubted that,\" added Norris, who will be back in action at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola on May 19.\n\n\"I am not sure I would have won today without the upgrades and without the hard work that the team has been putting in.

Following the 35-second penalty in the sprint, he was given a further 10-second penalty for an incident with Logan Sargeant.\n\nThen, he was awarded another 20-second penalty for the bad pit stop.

While it's true that Norris took full advantage of the Safety Car, coming into the pits at just the right time, that one incident alone doesn't tell the full story.\n\nMax Verstappen, the man who everyone believed (and rightfully so) would go on to win the race, had every chance to attack Norris after racing resumed, yet the British driver was having none of that, pulling away from the reigning F1 World Champion with surprising ease. Sure, Verstappen spoke about his struggles during the race, but hey, all is fair in love and war, and that McLaren was a genuine rocketship.\n\nYesterday's result also goes to show that Max Verstappen is indeed beatable. Like Agent Smith one said about Neo in The Matrix: \"You see? He's just a man.\"\n\nWhen the checkered flag dropped, Norris crossed the line no fewer than 7.61 seconds ahead of Verstappen, which is a monumental gap. It's usually the type of gap that you'd see between the champ's Red Bull and whoever it is that comes second. This is why Red Bull should be concerned - not because they lost, but rather because they lost by 7.61 seconds. Oh, and because Adrian Newey is leaving. That too.\n\n\"Today was a bit tricky. I think already on the medium [tires] it didn't feel fantastic, we were pulling away but not like it should be. Then once we made a pit stop, I heard what the lap times McLaren were doing and I was like, 'Well, that's pretty quick!\", said Verstappen during his post-race interview.\n\n\"Once they also switched onto the hard tire, they just had more pace, especially Lando he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint but if a bad day is P2, I take it,\" he added, before stating how happy he is to see Norris win his first-ever Formula 1 race.\n\nPhoto: McLaren Racing Maybe a little less happy was Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, who started P3 on the grid and was brought into the pits one lap before the Safety Car was called - talk about rotten luck. The Scuderia did get one of their drivers on the podium, but it was Leclerc and not Sainz who finished third.\n\nAs for what Norris had to say following his maiden F1 victory - it was pretty much what you'd expect (happy, grateful, motivated). However, what really surprised me was him stating that he had known since Friday's sessions that they had the pace to compete with Red Bull.\n\nFollowing yesterday's result, Norris moves into fourth place in the 2024 Driver Standings with 83 points. Leclerc is third with 98 points, while Perez and Verstappen have 103, and 136 points, respectively.\n\nNext up on the calendar is the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, set to take place on May 19.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sergiu_tudose@autoevolution.com", "name": "Sergiu Tudose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Newey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/lando-norris-wins-first-ever-f1-grand-prix-and-red-bull-have-a-right-to-be-concerned-233492_1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2939, "textEnd": 2945}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This opinion was given by none other than the McLaren star himself, even though he hesitated for a few seconds before making this admission.\n\n\"Are you the best British on the current Formula 1 grid,\" asked Craig Slater in a SkySports lie detector test on Norris. \"Yes,\" replied Norris, which turned out to be a lie on the test machine. Seeing his lie being caught, Norris changed his answer to \"Lewis.\"\n\nStatistically speaking, Hamilton has a mighty lead over Norris, with the former already having 103 wins in his kitty.

Then, the racing and result lived up to the hype as a sell-out crowd watched Lando Norris secure his first F1 win.\n\nWe rarely get a race that features good overtaking, intriguing strategy and a new winner all in one sitting. The Miami GP turned on a dime when a mid-race safety car caught out Max Verstappen after he'd already pitted for new tires. Norris pitted from the front, defended well off the restart and rode his fresher tires to the most monumental moment of his young career.\n\nThe racing behind him wasn't half bad, either. Tire degradation, pit strategy and a tricky circuit conspired to make for (by far) the best Miami GP we've seen in its three years of running.\n\nIn hindsight, Norris should've yelled, \"In 43 days!\" as he flipped that fan the bird (per Norris, it was a friendly exchange). Just to be accurate.\n\nObviously, nobody expected Norris to get his first F1 win at Miami on Sunday. Sure, some signs were there - McLaren brought a whole host of upgrades to Norris's car, and he was fast enough on Friday that he should've taken sprint pole. But he started P5 in the grand prix on a track that Verstappen has dominated for the past two seasons.\n\nJust like Carlos Sainz's win in Australia, which relied on a rare brake failure on Verstappen's car, Norris' win on Sunday depended on some luck. He needed the pit strategy to work in his favor and Kevin Magnussen to make an overly ambitious move on Logan Sargeant, bringing out the safety car in time for Norris to lead Verstappen with fresher tires.\n\nWith those two strokes of luck bouncing his way, Norris made the most of it with an excellent defensive move on the restart. And then that upgraded McLaren kicked in.\n\n\"Once we made a pit stop and I heard with the lap times the McLarens were doing, I said, well, (laughs) you know, it's pretty quick,\" Verstappen said. \"They just had more pace and especially Lando, he was flying.\"\n\nIt was years of patience and hard work colliding with talent and opportunity. Norris, who holds the record for most podiums before clinching the top spot, is a Formula One race winner.\n\n\"I mean, the whole weekend's been good,\" Norris said. \"You know, I just had some little setbacks along the way. But I knew on Friday we had the pace. (Had) just a couple mistakes, here and there. But today, we managed to put it together. We found the perfect strategy. It all paid off.\"\n\nIf his car doesn't break or he doesn't make a big mistake he can't be overcome, it's essentially become a given that Verstappen will end up on the top step of the podium. That's just how it's gone in F1 over the past two-plus years. It's Verstappen, then everyone else.\n\nNot so on Sunday. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, Verstappen was beaten, and soundly, by a competitor. Sure, you could argue that it all came down to an ill-timed (or well-timed, depending on your perspective). But untimely cautions are part of racing, and when Verstappen had his opportunity to pass Norris once the safety car came off, he couldn't do it. Norris outran him at the end, cruising to a nearly eight-second victory.\n\nSuch defeat is not something Verstappen is used to experiencing.\n\nFor a minute, it looked like Piastri would be the McLaren driver most benefiting from good luck. Sergio P\u00e9rez's Turn 1 lockup didn't just almost take out Verstappen, but it bunched up the field and gave Piastri an opening to zip into P3. After pit stops and the safety car sorted out, Piastri rode in P4 - and with Norris running away from Verstappen out front, McLaren was on tap for its best finish since Silverstone last year.\n\nAlas, a hard fight with Carlos Sainz undid Piastri's strong outing. Late in the race, Sainz poked and prodded at Piastri for P4, putting the move on the McLaren with a deep lunge into Turn 17. The Aussie turned in and clipped his front wing on Sainz's right rear tire. Piastri had to box and finish outside the points in P13.\n\nPiastri said after the race that he hadn't seen a replay of the incident but implied he wasn't thrilled with Sainz's move. He said the two drivers \"weren't particularly close to the apex\" when the contact was made. The stewards investigated after the session and served Sainz a five-second penalty and a penalty point.\n\nStill, iPiastri's race was very strong, even though his McLaren didn't have the same upgrades as Norris's. He has finished in the points in 13 of the last 19 races -- not bad for a 23-year-old in his second F1 season.\n\n\"I think definitely a lot of positives to come from today,\" Piastri said. \"I think, for both of us, the car was really strong. And I think for Lando to win the race on pace and to pull away from Max after the safety car, I think that's a very, very encouraging sign. So, very happy for him and for the whole team.\n\n\"And I think we deserve it. Our trajectory in the last 12 months has been towards this moment.\"\n\nWhat Sargeant needed was a clean race. To make it to the finish without incident. And if all went well, maybe leave his home race having scored his first point(s) on the season. Doing so would've gone a long way to ease some of the pressure on Sargeant at the moment, particularly during a weekend when it emerged a request had been submitted for Mercedes junior Andrea Kimi Antonelli, a possible option for Williams in the future, to get dispensation for a super license before he turns 18 in August.\n\nInstead, Sargeant leaves the Miami GP with another disappointing result (though through no fault of his own). While he may have been the victim of an overly ambitious move by Magnusson that sent him into the tire barriers, it doesn't change the fact that Sargeant departs Miami with both a damaged car and no points -- something that's occurred too frequently during his 27-race tenure with the team.\n\nWilliams F1 boss James Vowles said on F1TV this weekend that there was no plan to put Antonelli in the car for the next race at Imola and that the team was evaluating options for drivers to race for both 2025 and 2026, not wanting a one-year deal for whoever gets the seat. Whether Sargeant will get the chance to drive a Williams car through the end of the year remains to be seen.\n\nAfter the race, George Russell offered a brutally honest assessment of Mercedes' pace at this point in the season.\n\n\"We do have a few (upgrades) coming in in the short term, but nothing that's going to transform us into race winners right now,\" said Russell, who finished P8. \"I think we have to accept that we are the fourth fastest team at the moment. And the lap times don't lie, the championship doesn't lie. This is where we are. And as I said, I think we're fighting for the P5 to P8 region, week in, week out.\"\n\nCan't argue with that. Russell finished P8, Lewis Hamilton finished P6. After Norris' win on Sunday, Mercedes is fourth in the championship, 60 points behind McLaren. But we're all about optimism here, so it's fair to point out that Mercedes extracted some hard-earned points from a tough weekend.\n\nHamilton lacked straight-line speed in every Miami session. That led to extended tangles with the midfield Haas cars in the sprint race and the grand prix. (Something you wouldn't have bet on pre-2022.) But he ultimately won both of those battles. Hamilton also couldn't get around P\u00e9rez in the last half of the race on older mediums - but the fact that he breathed down a Red Bull's neck on old tires for that long is a positive sign.\n\nMercedes (and its fans) don't want to hear how a P6 and P8 finish could be a positive. And it's not. Neither driver will be happy with the results. But you can't say the drivers aren't full of fight and extracting everything they can out of those machines.\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix has crafted a well-deserved reputation for being all about the vibes, celebrity sightings and producing an electric atmosphere.\n\nThis was again the case on Sunday. A-listers on site included Kansas City Chiefs teammates Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, famed Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer and singer Camila Cabello. It was particularly festive on the grid pre-race, where thumping music and a lively, sold-out crowd contributed to giving the race a \"big fight feel.\"\n\nAs it has for the past two years, the Miami Grand Prix checked all the boxes that have become synonymous with F1's annual visit to South Florida.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors":

Charles Leclerc finished third, while a grid penalty for Carlos Sainz dropped him to fifth with Sergio Perez moving to fourth.\n\nDespite failing to win, Verstappen led the congratulations from his rival as, one after another, they gave him a huge hug to celebrate his success. Verstappen heaped praise on the Brit and claimed he \"deserved it\" in his post-race interview, while Lewis Hamilton admitted he was \"so happy for Lando\".\n\nThe McLaren team celebrated their success\n\nAfter receiving his winners' trophy and medal on the podium, Norris and McLaren celebrated with a team photo in front of the garage. Over 50 members of staff were present, including team principal Andrea Stella as McLaren toasted a first Grand Prix win of their own since Monza in 2021.\n\nHowever, after a number of different team photos were taken, bottles of champagne were popped and sprayed in the direction of Norris. Among those joining in the party were Ferrari boss Vasseur, who appeared from behind a photographer with a McLaren cap on his head before darting towards the celebrations.\n\nEven Fred Vasseur was getting involved with the McLaren celebrations\n\nOnce he sprayed his bottle, Vasseur then walked over to pour any remaining last drop of alcohol near Norris and the McLaren media team. Despite both members of his team finishing third and fifth, Vasseur appeared to cut a delighted figure - like most of the circuit - for Norris.\n\nReacting to his success, Norris said: \"About time, huh? What a race. It's been a long time coming but finally I've managed to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team - I've finally delivered for them. It was a long day, a tough race, but I'm finally on top and over the moon.\"\n\nNorris was due to fly back to England after the race, but following advice from Hamilton, he confirmed himself that his flight had been changed to Monday so that he can toast his maiden victory.\n\n\"I was meant to fly [tonight], but Zak [Brown] just told me we fly tomorrow,\" Norris revealed. \"I'm not going to sleep - I'm going all the way! I might have just a scratch on my nose tomorrow, but I don't care. This only happens once, when you're taking your first win.\n\n\"It's nice that it was here at Miami - I was kind of hoping it would be at Silverstone but I'll try to do it there as well. Tonight is going to be a good night.\"\n\nVerstappen, who was beaten by the speed of Norris over the 57 laps, was gracious in defeat. \"If I get beaten, it's great that it has been done by Lando,\" the Dutchman said. \"He deserves it. It's been a long time coming and it's going to be the first of many.\n\n\"Maybe it's also a bit of relief for him that he has that win now, who knows what's going to happen next? But for sure they had a strong weekend. Maybe it was a little bit messy still [on Saturday] but today they were flying - and especially Lando was flying. So definitely very happy for him.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

However, his maiden victory in the apex motorsport series might have been influenced by a slight stroke of good fortune. The Briton himself admitted that and is ready to share his trophy and champagne with Logan Sargeant and Kevin Magnussen for granting him his first success.\n\nWhen Max Verstappen had to pit after he knocked a cone, he damaged his front wing and Norris managed to take the race lead from him. The situation got much better when Magnussen knocked Sargeant out of the race. Hence, forcing a safety car that gave a cheap pitstop to the 24-year-old race driver.\n\nAnd for this series of events, Norris, albeit jokingly, offered his trophy to both drivers. \"Today was my day. Today was the day when someone was like 'I'm gonna throw a safety car now.' And it all worked out perfectly. So whoever that person was, I thank them and I share my trophy and champagne with them.\" said Norris to Lawrence Barreto after the race.\n\nSeeing the series of events, there is no doubt Norris should thank Magnussen and Sargeant. However, when all the jokes were done, Norris, in the end, thanked his team for their brilliant work and strategy throughout the race.\n\nMeanwhile, Norris' interview showed that this remarkable event has brought immense joy to him. So much so that he claims he will party hard once again and \"might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow.\"\n\nRight until the middle of the 2023 season, McLaren was failing to match the standards of its rivals under the new regulations. that indeed frustrated the Briton until the Papaya team made a turnaround last season.\n\nSince then, Norris has kept faith in his team, and even last year talked about McLaren's win being around the corner. While that success didn't land last year, it surely did in Miami this year. And with that, there is no doubt that McLaren is in the mix this season.\n\nWith Norris' rapid pace gain on Verstappen, it surely displayed that with the new upgrades, McLaren is a force to reckon with. Therefore, the tracks with higher suitability to McLaren might become an irritant to Red Bull.\n\nWith this odd result, it has also been highlighted that Red Bull might not have yet another seamless stroll to the championship. With Ferrari also showing flashes of brilliance here and there, the Milton-Keynes-based team might have to push extra hard to seal the championship this year.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanish_chachra@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanish Chachra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 Formula One World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/5a2de2f2-f1-2024-05-06t053858.394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Verstappen had seemed well placed to claim a fifth win in six races until a midway crash allowed McLaren to cash in on a safety car period, with Norris pitting and coming out with the lead.\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris capitalised on a bit of good fortune to win the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, holding off Red Bull's triple world champion Max Verstappen for his first Formula One victory. It was a long overdue triumph for the Briton who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), having finished runner-up an agonising eight times in 110 grand prix.\n\nVerstappen had seemed well placed to claim a fifth win in six races until a midway crash allowed McLaren to cash in on a safety car period, with Norris pitting and coming out with the lead. Seeking a Miami hat-trick of wins, the Dutchman filled Norris's mirrors on the restart but his Red Bull could offer no challenge as the McLaren pulled clear.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc completed the podium, coming home third ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz, who was later penalised five seconds for his involvement in a collision with McLaren's Oscar Piastri dropping the Spaniard to fifth. The penalty moved Verstappen's Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez up one spot to fourth.\n\n\"About time! What a race. It's been a long time coming. Finally I've managed to do it,\" Norris told Sky Sports. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. \"Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way.\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it all together.\" In a season dominated by Red Bull it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Briton.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race. Until Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the grand prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over his Perez. Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando Alonso grabbed ninth while Esteban Ocon earned struggling Alpine their first point of the season crossing 10th. Starting from pole, Verstappen was in command through the first 20 laps but was unable to open up more than a three-second lead on Piastri.\n\nAs the race reached the midway mark Verstappen made a rare unpressured mistake, going wide and hitting a bollard that broke and was left on the track, bringing out the virtual safety car. Verstappen was then quickly into the pits with Piastri, who had already pitted, assuming the lead.\n\nWith the first round of pit stops about to be completed and Verstappen about to retake the lead, McLaren got a lucky break. Williams' Logan Sargeant spun into the wall, bringing out the safety car and allowing Norris to pit and come out still in the lead, which he never let go.\n\n\"You win, you lose,\" said Verstappen. \"I think we're all used to that in racing, right? \"Today was just a bit tricky. If a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The McLaren Formula 1 driver can finally call himself a race winner after competing in the pinnacle of motorsport for a little over five years. It was not the best weekend after qualifying fifth behind Sergio Perez, Carlos Sainz, Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen. But, the good in-race calls made by Andrea Stella and insanely fast pit stops by the McLaren team allowed the British driver to take over in the late stages of the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nLando Norris is now the 21st British driver ever to become a Formula 1 race winner. The last Brit to do so is his fellow 2019 debutant, George Russell. That happened way back in the 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. This triumphant moment in the Miami Grand Prix also gets McLaren its first win in nearly three years. The last Papaya driver to do it? His former teammate Daniel Ricciardo during the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nThis moment had Formula 1 fans going all sorts of insane. The fact that he also joins Carlos Sainz as the only two drivers to get a win in the era of Red Bull and Max Verstappen's dominance made it all the sweeter to hear the British National Anthem at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\n\"And @LandoNorris SO F***ING PROUD OF YOU!! You did it! Your first win race!! Amazing race and an amazing result. Let's prepare for your next win races!\" a user wrote.\n\nSome of the McLaren faithful were just glad that the new star of their team finally got over the hump, \"It took 5 years for Lando to win, but it felt SO SO GOOD, srsly, the wait made it more special, my god, I'm so proud of you, @LandoNorris. #MiamiGP.\"\n\nOthers were more hyped about how the McLaren Formula 1 driver kept his cool despite Max Verstappen chasing him down the whole time, \"After racking up a record 15 winless podiums, Lando Norris has finally won his first Formula 1 race! Incredible pace & didn't make a single mistake when leading ahead of Max Verstappen. What a drive.\"\n\nLando Norris, McLaren's astounding strategy to notch a first Formula 1 win\n\nQualifying fifth at the start of the Miami Grand Prix weekend is not ideal. Often, the foregone conclusion is that Max Verstappen is likely going to run away with the race win after notching pole position. But, it was just not fate after the race had to slow down for a while due to a safety car.\n\nMcLaren took advantage after the current Formula 1 World Drivers' Champion got picked up by the safety car. Instead of following the Dutch driver outside, Norris and McLaren decided to pit for new tires. This closed the gap between the two. Verstappen eventually had to give up the lead such that he could head to the pit lane anyway. Eventually, the British Formula 1 driver was able to hold the lead and secure his maiden win.\n\nIn the words of Charles Leclerc, \"Lando, we can be a world champion, I said.\"\n\nThose words might just slowly come true if McLaren continues their resurgence in Formula 1.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stella_(engineer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stella (engineer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lando-Norris-Miami-Grand-Prix-win-has-fans-going-crazy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Starting from fifth, the Briton had everything to be able to win, and former McLaren mechanic Marc Priestly luckily placed a bet on it.\n\nPriestly revealed the same thing to X (formerly Twitter). \"I promise this is true....I never bet on #F1, but yesterday I put a bet on @LandoNorris to win the #MiamiGP\", wrote Priestly. The 47-year-old also revealed 18/1 odds to express how happy he was with his bet. Although the odds were against Norris, he undoubtedly deserved his win.\n\nNorris was running sixth in the early stages of the race when the safety car incident allowed him to take matters into his own hands. On lap 29, when a safety car was released after Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant crashed, McLaren and Norris played a beautiful strategy to take the lead and grab the win.\n\nRunning at P6, after everyone in front of him had made the pitstop, Norris boxed in normal racing conditions and emerged in the lead with Max Verstappen demoted to second. From there on, Norris defended his lead, and with a cool, calm, and collected performance, he booted the torments of his near miss at the 2021 Russian GP.\n\nAt his 110th Grand Prix, Norris finally got to spray the champagne on his crew with the winning trophy at the exceptional Miami GP circuit.\n\n\"Finally, I've managed to do it,\" said Lando Norris as he claimed his maiden victory in F1. It had indeed been a long time coming for him, as he had previously won several podiums but never finished on the top step.\n\nInterestingly, Norris also registered an unwanted record in the process. After his podium finish in Australia, he became the first driver to register 14 podiums but never a win. Norris then extended that run in China by finishing second.\n\nHowever, with Norris finally breaking his curse, he was unsurprisingly nothing short of ecstatic. The 24-year-old had a gleaming smile as he jumped into the hands of his McLaren team to celebrate his maiden win.\n\nThis victory is also a testament to McLaren's improvement since the start of the 2022 season when F1 first introduced the new ground-effect regulations. It was only in midseason last year that McLaren seemed to have come to terms with the rules, and since then, they have been on an upward slope.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidit_dhawan@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Vidit Dhawan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Formula_One_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 Formula One World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(cars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ground effect (cars)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/9d3209ed-lando-norris-wins.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It needed an error by Max Verstappen and safety car luck for the McLaren driver to finish P1 in Miami on Saturday. But Norris' best friend on the grid, Carlos Sainz, puts forward the 'fortune favors the brave' argument to validate the credibility of his first success.\n\n\"He deserves it for such a long time to win a race. He's a driver that will win many races in F1. \"He's been driving at an exceptional level. Today he was on the lucky side but luck comes to people who deserve it and today he definitely deserves it,\" said Sainz to Sky Sports.\n\nVerstappen knocked down a cone on one of the chicanes, which forced him to pit to repair his damaged front wing. This gave the 24-year-old the lead. Then, Logan Sargeant's crash around the same brought out the safety car, giving Norris a virtually free pit stop.\n\nThis series of unusual events gave Norris an edge during the safety car restart and he capitalized on it, giving no room for Verstappen reo recover. The Briton maintained his composure for the next 25 laps, and his maiden Grand Prix win was in sight.\n\nOn the final lap, making no unforced errors, Norris crossed the chequered flag and roared on his radio with pure ecstasy. It finally marked the end of him being on the receiving end of 'he hasn't won a race' jokes on social media.\n\nAhead of the Miami GP, McLaren boss Andrea Stella declared that his team will be coming with a new set of upgrades. And surely, they worked. Starting from P5, Norris backed an impressive win, thus exhibiting the actual potential of McLaren's 2024 car.\n\nWith Red Bull initially expected to coast to another Championship victory, Ferrari and now McLaren's respective race wins this season indicate that things may not be as easy for the Milton-Keynes-based outfit.\n\nNorris' win would have also reaffirmed his belief in the Papaya team, which was on the verge of breaking down during the first half of the 2023 season. Now, it is on McLaren to maintain this upward trajectory and become an actual Championship contender in 2025 (if not this year).\n\nOn the other hand, Ferrari is also reported to bring a new set of upgrades to the next race -- the Emilia Romagna GP.

That is no longer the case after his Miami Grand Prix triumph, although really it should never have been reality.\n\nHis first win should have come way back in the 2021 Russian Grand Prix, a race Norris says \"a lot of people talk crap about\". A late downpour cost Norris victory that day and started a strange narrative that he is a choker who cannot deliver a big result on a big occasion.\n\nAfter finally breaking his duck in Miami, though, Norris gave an emphatic takedown of the criticism he has been following for some time.\n\nPROVING CRITICS WRONG\n\nNorris joked after the Miami GP that he enjoys 'liking' the negative comments he received on Instagram about his (previously) winless F1 career.\n\n\"I freaking love it,\" he says. \"It makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando No-wins'. That's become the thing.\n\n\"To finally prove those people wrong, and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face. So, I thank all of them.\"\n\nWhen Norris looks back on the time between Russia 2021 and now, he says he sees missed pole positions, missed podiums and a missed sprint race win in Qatar. He admits that, and he's often extremely critical of himself for making errors in qualifying in particular.\n\nBut he really doesn't believe he's blown a golden opportunity to win a grand prix, which is hard to argue with. There have been many occasions where he has driven exceptionally well and been rewarded with a podium but nothing more.\n\n\"There was one opportunity, and this was Qatar [the sprint race] last year,\" he says. \"I don't know if there was a main race that I've missed out on, to be honest.\n\n\"I've thrown away maybe a podium or a P2, but I think every opportunity where I've been there to try and take a win, I've been there.\n\n\"As much as people want to say there was this and that and Russia [2021] and whatever, there wasn't a Sunday I've missed out on a win because of something I've done wrong.\n\n\"There were pole positions. There was a sprint race win. But nothing more than that.\n\n\"And I think that's why I never lost faith. I never didn't believe in what I could go out and do.\"\n\nHAUNTING SOCHI A TURNING POINT\n\nNorris's critics remember Sochi 2021 for him wrongly staying out on slicks in the wet while Lewis Hamilton changed tyres, and throwing away victory as the rain poured down even harder soon after.\n\nBut it was McLaren that misjudged the situation. It didn't anticipate a second, more aggressive downpour, which meant Norris did not have the same information Hamilton had. Expecting the conditions to remain the same, Norris thought he could continue. Had he been informed there would be even more rain, he would have stopped.\n\nMcLaren took responsibility then, and still does now. Race engineer Will Joseph said after the Miami win: \"It [Sochi] haunts me every day. It haunts me in my sleep. I feel like we can put that behind us now.\"\n\nNorris says that back then \"I didn't do the best of jobs and as a team we didn't\". Stella sees it as \"a bit of a turning point for Lando and for the team\", to understand how to operate and work together in a high-pressure situation with that kind of result on the line.\n\n\"If I go back to that race, I think responsibility is on the pitwall, because we didn't enforce the call to pit enough,\" Stella reflects.\n\n\"The driver on track, he doesn't see if it's raining somewhere else. We could see it. So it was our limitation in not enforcing Lando to pit.\n\n\"Even in that case, he was delivering the job. But we were not ready as a team to achieve the victory.\"\n\nThat has since changed. Norris has finished second to Verstappen seven times in the past 12 months. All he needed on those days was for anything to trip up the Red Bull, and he'd have won.\n\nBut that slice of fortune never arrived - until Sunday in Miami.\n\nMORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER\n\nBoth Norris and Stella admit this was a weight off some shoulders. For Norris, because it has been such a long time coming. And for McLaren because the pressure to produce a car capable of winning, especially for Norris, has grown over time.\n\n\"We were totally convinced that the gap to victory for Lando, it wasn't in Lando, it was in the team,\" says Stella.\n\n\"We needed to provide him with winning material. And as soon as we did it, he achieved it.\n\n\"That's for me testament to how ready he was.\"\n\nBoth also feel this was on the cards once the stars finally aligned. And at the first realistic opportunity with a car capable of winning, they have converted the chance.\n\n\"I've been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes and the team have got what it takes, and I was patient with it,\" says Norris.\n\n\"I've just been doing my job and executing my races, executing my qualis, and doing what I can do best. And I knew my time was coming.\"\n\nNorris had a strange weekend until Sunday, as he underperformed in sprint qualifying then was wiped out at the first corner of the sprint race itself, before qualifying a solid if slightly disappointing fifth for the grand prix.\n\nHowever, as he did for the previous race in China - another weekend to feature a disappointing sprint race - Norris gathered things together and produced an excellent grand prix performance when it counted.\n\nAnd while it was not a perfect weekend from start to finish, Stella believes Norris is reaping rewards this year from a better approach.\n\n\"Credit to Lando that he kept developing,\" Stella says. \"He developed over the winter, especially looking at improving in qualifying, delivering laps that sometimes don't have to be 100%.\n\n\"When you have a fast car, just be there. And I think he's doing that.\n\n\"I also have to say his race management is now very mature. As soon as he saw there wasn't much to do after the first lap, he started to save tyres, because he knew his race would come at some stage.\n\n\"Then the pace he was able to pull off once the cars ahead of him pitted, that was quite incredible.\n\n\"So, fast in qualifying, even sometimes pacing himself, and very mature in the race in terms of getting the most out of the material he has.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-race.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Race"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_mitchell_malm@the-race.com", "name": "Scott Mitchell-Malm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 Russian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Joseph_(rugby_union,_born_1877)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Joseph (rugby union, born 1877)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1200/2024/05/Norris-new-tw-card.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

So there were emotional scenes at the end of Sunday's Miami Grand Prix as the Briton celebrated winning in F1 for the first time.\n\nFist pumps and hugs with colleagues are common after any driver wins. But even these days it is rare to see drivers congratulate a rival with as much enthusiasm as many of them produced as they spoke with Norris.\n\nTo his credit, Max Verstappen put aside his own disappointment to be the first to heap praise on his friend. He said: \"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last one so yeah, he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nNorris also got big hugs from Fernando Alonso and Daniel Ricciardo, among others. And Charles Leclerc, who finished third, explained why there is so much love and mutual respect between this new generation of F1 stars.\n\nThe Ferrari driver said: \"I'm just very happy for Lando, as we all want to beat one another. It's always nice to see the emotions. We've all come up together, and we came up through. I saw him in KF3, and from there we always want to make it to F1, and then the first race is special, and he must celebrate it.\"\n\nBut there is another key reason for everyone not of a Red Bull persuasion to be delighted with the manner of Norris' victory. The way he put McLaren 's upgrades to good use and sped away from Verstappen reminded everyone that the Dutchman is not invincible.\n\nVerstappen struggled with the balance of his car over the course of the weekend and was not at one with his car in Miami, as he so often is. And, speaking to media after the race, boss Christian Horner claimed his star driver had picked up damage when he hit a bollard.\n\nBut the reality is McLaren introduced a raft of car upgrades which improved their pace so much they could take on the Red Bulls and win. And with that success comes a flicker of optimism that it might be possible for teams to take the fight to the defending champions after all.\n\nAsked if he felt Norris' pace was indicative of McLaren being able to compete with Red Bull regularly, Verstappen simply replied: \"I hope not!\" Red Bull will want things to be business as usual at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix next time out - the other nine teams will pray for another McLaren challenge.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKJ_(karting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OKJ (karting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32742709.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AUTO-PRIX-F1-USA-PODIUM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Verstappen got a great start and built up a sizable gap over McLaren's Oscar Piastri, though not quite to the extent of previous races.\n\nThat all changed though, with a fortuitously timed safety car for McLaren's Lando Norris. Williams' Logan Sargent and Haas' Kevin Magnussen collided, with Magnussen deemed to be at fault. Sargent was sent into the wall, which ended his race and necessitated a safety car to remove the Williams from the track.\n\nThat allowed Norris to save a ton of time and grab a cheap pit stop, while Verstappen was stuck out on track after an earlier stop. After the restart, Norris used the new tires to build a big gap between him and Verstappen in second, a gap that would prove to be enough to secure Norris' first ever win in Formula 1.\n\nIt was the first race of the year in which Verstappen finished and didn't secure a win, with the World Champion complaining during the race that he couldn't get the car to turn in. In some races this season, and in previous years, the advantage for Verstappen and the Red Bull has been so big that he's been able to withstand poorly timed safety cars or underwhelming pace.\n\nNot Sunday.\n\nFor Norris, it's a remarkable win; yes he benefited from the safety car, but turned in great lap after great lap prior to the pit stop, allowing him to maintain a close enough gap to pounce when given the opportunity. And then ran away from the rest of the grid afterward.\n\nTrump congratulated Norris after the race as well.\n\nIn a season where Verstappen's felt inevitable, the Norris win provides some much needed variety.

On the surface it is easy to get excited about the nature of his win given the one-sided championship season we have seen to this point and the ease with which Verstappen has won the other four races he has finished in 2024.\n\n- Norris beats Verstappen in Miami GP for first F1 win\n\n- Watch Formula One on ESPN networks all season long\n\nEven more tantalizing was the fact Norris' victory -- his first in 110 F1 race starts -- came at the first attempt with the big upgrade package McLaren brought to the race, its first significant one of the year so far. Teammate Oscar Piastri will also have the new package for F1's next race, Imola's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix.\n\nWhile a new race winner will always prompt excitable statements about a new reality at the front, there were clear extenuating circumstances which helped end Norris' winless streak.\n\nThe collision between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant which prompted the Safety Car changed the course of the contest, rewarding Norris and McLaren for going long with the first stint. The Magnussen-Sargeant clash happened shortly after Norris had moved from fifth up to first as his rivals pitted. The British driver had been carefully managing his tyres in a bid to attack with fresh rubber later in the race.\n\nMcLaren felt like Norris' extended first stint would have left him with the pace to attack at the end of the race had there not been a Safety Car, although he was skeptical he could have made enough passes on track to win the race in that scenario.\n\n\"It would have been tough,\" Norris said on the hypothetical of a race without a Safety Car. \"I would have had to overtake two Ferraris, a Red Bull, Oscar [Piastri].\"\n\nThen there was the state of Red Bull's car all weekend, and notably Verstappen's during the race itself. Despite taking pole position for the sprint (which he won) and for the grand prix, Verstappen and Red Bull struggled to get their hands around the set-up of the car around the Miami circuit.\n\nVerstappen potentially complicated matters further when he went straight over the Turn 14/15 chicane, knocking over a cone in the process.\n\n\"I don't think we had a great balance all weekend,\" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said on Sunday evening. \"Obviously, he hit the bollard around Lap 20 and that has actually done quite a lot of damage to the underside of the car, so we will have to look at exactly what the effect of that was.\n\n\"It is a reasonable amount of the area around the left rear floor. There is a reasonable amount that's missing and you can see it awfully flexing as well, so it certainly wouldn't be helping.\"\n\nVerstappen himself made light of the incident -- joking \"I didn't like [the cone], so I decided to take it out and test the durability of the front wing as well!\" -- but downplayed Horner's suggestion it had a negative impact on his car's performance.\n\nRed Bull later explained Verstappen had not seen pictures of the car before going into the press conference. \"He lost two-and-a-half-tenths in Turn 1 every lap,\" Horner said. \"Whether that was because of the damage... when you actually see the pictures of what was missing, it wasn't designed like that.\"\n\nMcLaren came away from the weekend excited at the clear gains made with the upgrade and just with its pace in general. Raw lap times in the race had looked good. Even Piastri, driving in the \"old-spec\" McLaren without all the upgrades Norris had available to him, had looked competitive before a tangle with Carlos Sainz ruined his race. Team boss Andreas Stella played down the suggestion Norris' win was a sign of a new reality in F1 in the immediate future.\n\n\"I think yes, we improved the car,\" Stella said of the upgraded package. \"We know in the numbers how much we improved it. And it's material, you see it in lap time.\n\n\"But I think this race for Red Bull was a little bit of a struggle. So before we say the pace we saw today is a representative of the future, I'm not going to put my signature on this statement.\"\n\nThe race represented another feather in Stella's cap, having also orchestrated the huge turnaround McLaren achieved last year when it leaped from the back of the order to being Red Bull's closest rival on the back of one upgrade at the Austrian Grand Prix in June 2023. Another successful upgrade will only heighten the optimism and momentum which Stella has cultivated since stepping into the team boss role.\n\nIt will also serve as a reminder about just how tangible progress can be with the right development path.\n\n\"We take this positive, we take this encouragement,\" Stella added on Sunday. \"If anything it's even more energy to develop in my view, if you want to fight consistently Red Bull, we need to deliver another package like the one we have delivered here.\n\n\"In Japan we were sixth-tenths away in qualifying of Red Bull. In China we were a few tenths away. It would be completely unrealistic to think what we've seen here is the updated picture of competitiveness. I think here Red Bull didn't get the most out of their package.\"\n\nTeammate Piastri will get the same upgrade in two weeks as McLaren goes to Imola's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at full strength. Red Bull will still expect to be the benchmark team on pace, but McLaren's competitiveness will be a major talking point going into the next race.\n\nFans who were growing bored of seeing Verstappen cruise to victories most weekends can take comfort in the fact McLaren seems to be on a strong development path and that there are big steps forward still to be found under the current regulations.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austrian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0506%2Fr1329310_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nNorris' triumph comes three years and 58 races after the infamous Sochi blunder, where the McLaren driver refused to change to wet tyres in the latter stages of race, sliding off the track and denying himself a maiden F1 victory.\n\n\"I feel like we can put Russia 2021 behind us now,\" Will Joseph, Norris' race engineer, told Sky Sports after the race.\n\n\"Everyone at McLaren does a fantastic job. The team foundation is so strong right now, Andrea's leadership is phenomenal and we just go from strength to strength.\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella continued: \"(Lando) deserves it so much. We have always said, as soon as we give him the right material, he will make it and he made it.\n\n\"I know what kind of work is behind this. It's so deserved for the McLaren team. I hope everyone enjoys this moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Norris relished the opportunity to silence the social media critics that dubbed him \"Lando NoWins\".\n\n\"I am happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong,\" he said during the post-race press conference.\n\n\"I love it to go on Instagram and like all the comments from people abusing me, I freaking love it, makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando NoWins', that's become the thing.\"\n\n\"For me to prove those people wrong and prove (to) the people who didn't think I could go out and do it, it's going to be an even bigger smile on my face today, so I thank all of them.\"\n\n'HE WAS FLYING': MCLAREN PACE TURNS HEADS\n\nIt can't be denied that Norris' upgraded MCL38 showed plenty of promise at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nMcLaren added ten different upgrades to the British driver's car ahead of this weekend, with the changes paying dividends in Sunday's race.\n\nWhen the Safety Car ended on the 33rd lap, Norris successfully kept Red Bull's Max Verstappen out of DRS range and crossed the finish seven seconds ahead of the three-time world champion.\n\n\"Once we made a pit stop I heard what the lap times McLaren were doing and I was like, 'Well, that's pretty quick,'\" Verstappen confessed after the race.\n\n\"Once they switched onto the hard tyre, they just had more pace, and especially Lando, he was flying.\n\n\"It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint.\"\n\nHowever, Red Bull later revealed that Verstappen had sustained some minor damage to the underside of his car after hitting a bollard on the 23rd lap.\n\nWhen asked whether McLaren was showing its true pace following the raft of car updates, Verstappen responded: \"I hope not!\n\n\"They came with an upgrade, for sure it looks like it works so we have a bit of work to do from our side.\n\n\"I think definitely it wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyse it all and we'll try to come back stronger.\"\n\nIt's impossible to predict where Norris would have finished if not for the collision between Haas' Kevin Magnussen and Williams' Logan Sargeant, but early signs suggest McLaren might continue fighting with Ferrari for podiums over the coming months, and has closed the gap to the top.\n\nThe Woking-based team still won't be rivalling the mighty Red Bulls on a regulary basis anytime soon, but the champions and Mercedes will be wary of the papaya car's improvement.\n\nThe gap between Ferrari and McLaren has closed to 63 points on the constructors' standings, with a potential battle for second looming on the horizon.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them,\" Norris continued.\n\n\"Today proved exactly that.\"\n\nPiastri, who was on track for a podium finish in Miami before the Safety Car, also stands to benefit once the full suite of upgrades filters to his car in Imola.\n\nThere wasn't much that Daniel Ricciardo could have achieved during Sunday's race having started in last place on the grid.\n\nThe Australian, who was knocked out in Q1 during Saturday's qualifying session, had already copped a three-place grid penalty for a Safety Car breach during last month's Chinese Grand Prix.\n\nAfter getting stuck in traffic, Ricciardo crossed the line in 15th, while RB teammate Yuki Tsunoda finished seventh in front of Mercedes' George Russell.\n\n\"Entering the race you always have some optimism, but yesterday's quali hurt,\" Ricciardo explained after the race.\n\n\"We were stuck in traffic in the race and were simply not quick enough to come through the field.\n\n\"We struggled a lot to use our pace compared to what we did yesterday in the Sprint with the clean air.\n\n\"We'll definitely be looking into it in our debrief, but generally, we know that we have to qualify better, like I did on Friday.\n\n\"Taking the positives, the team leaves Miami very happy; I had a good Sprint Qualifying and Sprint in the previous days, and Yuki also got some points today.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his 2024 campaign, Ricciardo bounced back during Saturday's Sprint by finishing fourth to secure five valuable points. However, according to former world champion Jenson Button, the Perth driver's impressive Sprint has been overshadowed by another disappointing race, where he was once again outperformed by his teammate.\n\n\"The problem for him is that he'll be looking at where his teammate finished,\" Button said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"That's the battle at the moment, between him and his teammate.\n\n\"People forget that, they'll remember the results, and that's the problem.\n\n\"It's about him picking himself up after this and getting a great result.\n\n\"That's the battle that's important for him right now, for his future in the sport.\"\n\nFormer IndyCar driver Danica Patrick continued: \"You're only as good as your last race.\n\n\"He's going to be down and he's going to wish it could have been different.\n\n\"I hope he remembers that he had an incredible Saturday.\"\n\nNorris has revealed that Donald Trump joked he was the British driver's \"lucky charm\" after the former US President visited the McLaren team before Sunday's race.\n\nTrump, the Republican 2024 presidential candidate, arrived at Hard Rock Stadium before the race and visited the McLaren garage where he met with chief executive Zak Brown and then sought out Norris after the race.\n\n\"I didn't see him in the garage to be honest, I was busy prepping for the race, but he saw me after, and he came up to congratulate me,\" Norris explained.\n\n\"I guess it's an honour, because whenever you have someone like this, it has to be an honour for them to come up to you, to take time out of their life, to pay their respect for what you've done.\n\n\"He said he was my lucky charm, because it's my win, so I don't know if he's going to come to more races now.\"\n\nNorris said he appreciated Trump's words from their post-race exchange.\n\n\"There's a lot of special people, or cool people that have been here this weekend,\" Norris continued.\n\n\"Donald is someone that you've got to have a lot of respect for in

'But then I moved to quad biking. I was a big fan. Then I really got into motorcross.'\n\nNow he is one of the most successful F1 drivers both on and off the racetrack.\n\nNot only does he have a four-year contract estimated to be worth a whopping \u00a380 million, the racing pro has a series of luxury brand deals and has starred in a number of glam photoshoots.\n\nClutching onto a series of supercars, designer watches and a stunning \u00a320million mansion in Surrey. As well as career success, his personal life has also been blossoming.\n\nLando Norris reached new heights as he entered the Formula One history books with a first Grand Prix win\n\nNorris is amongst Formula One's most-popular drivers and promotes a luxury lifestyle on his social media accounts\n\nLando Norris was recently spotted with Margarida Corceiro at the Monte-Carlo Masters final\n\nLando and his millionaire businessman father Adam Norris arrive at the Bahrain Grand Prix in March\n\nPortuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro, who Norris has been regularly spotted with over the past year\n\nCorceiro is the ex-girlfriend of Barcelona footballer Joao Felix\n\nOver the past year, he has ben regularly spotted alongside the ex-girlfriend of Barcelona footballer Joao Felix, Portuguese model and actress Margarida Corceiro, only add to speculation and discussion about his romantic life.\n\nThe pair were recently spotted at the Monte-Carlo Masters final amid her split from Felix last year. Norris and Corceiro were first spotted together last May in a video on social media showing the 24-year-old driving his Fiat Jolly with her in the back of the classic car.\n\nNorris had previously been dating Luisinha Oliveira, with the McLaren driver beginning a relationship with the Portuguese model at the start of 2022.\n\nThe relationship ended in September that year, with Norris confirming the split on social media.\n\nLike many of the F1 elite, Norris grew up in an affluent family, living in the rural town of Glastonbury, Somerset.\n\nHe is the second son of multi-millionaire businessman Adam Norris - who has amassed a \u00a3205 million fortune - and his mother Cisca, from Belgium.\n\nNorris is one of four children - having an elder brother called Oli, and two younger sisters Flo and Cisca.\n\nHe attended school in Somerset but ultimately left without any GCSEs in pursuit of a career in support, later studying physics and maths with the help of a personal tutor.\n\nNorris became the youngest go-karting world champion at just age 14 - a title previously held by Lewis Hamilton.\n\nIt was during his time on the go-karting scene that he was talent-spotted by McLaren who were impressed by the record breaking youngster.\n\nNorris became the youngest-ever British Formula One driver when he made his debut in the competition in 2019 at just 19-years-old at the Australian GP after coming through the ranks of the garage as an FP2 star.\n\nTeam principal Zak Brown once called an even-more youthful Norris to his office in 2019 to tell him the news that he was being given a contract and full-time seat in Formula One, telling him at the time: 'Welcome to Formula One.'\n\nNorris was drencehd in champagne atop the podium by Red Bull's Max Verstappen (left) and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (right)\n\nPhotography appears to be one of Norris' favourite hobbies during his spare time\n\nBarcelona forward Felix had been dating Portuguese model and actress Corceiro since 2019\n\nCorceiro was recently spotted at the Monte-Carlo Masters final amid her split from Felix last year\n\nCorceiro has been spotted with Norris regularly over the past year\n\nThe Englishman took the news calmly at the time and has taken to the on and off-track demands that being one of the world's biggest sporting celebrities brings with it.\n\nFormula One's media moguls have wrangled their product as being the glitzy and most glamorous event as their recent success in Miami showed and Norris is central to their image - and McLaren's.\n\nThe energetic and motor-obsessed babyface of the sport has never looked unnerved by driving for McLaren and settled quickly in the sport, making podiums along the way but always falling short until passing the chequered flag first on Sunday.\n\n110 starts for McLaren finally came to their best moment yet in the season's seventh race of the calendar and Norris can now look to soaking in the American sunshine while toasting a first glorious GP victory.\n\nHis age and combined millionaire status make celebrations a grander affair with Norris renowned for occasions where even recently he got injured accidentally while playing around partying.\n\nA night out in Amsterdam, Holland ahead of the Miami event saw Norris sustain a gruesome facial injury and was pictured sporting a cut on his face while on board a boat in the Dutch capital, having seemingly revelled in the King's Day celebrations.\n\nImages quickly circulated on social media showing Norris, 24, with a bloodied bandage stretched across his face - although he appeared in good spirits.\n\nAny signs of pain born from that injury were quickly doused in champagne by Red Bull's, Verstappen and Ferrari driver Charles LeClerc on the podium as the three celebrate and toasted to their success.\n\nNorris is an avid sports lover away from the racetrack and indulges in a busy lifestyle\n\nLando Norris was first spotted with Corceiro in Monaco in May 2023 via social media\n\nNorris shares a close friendship with Red Bull's F1 reigning world champion Max Verstappen (left)\n\nMarks of Norris' face injury suffered while partying in Amsterdam in the build-up to race weekend could be seen while he celebrated\n\nNorris ended his 110-race wait for a first Grand Prix victory by winning in America on Sunday\n\nNorris' popularity amongst his fellow competitors was evident more than ever to see at the end of the race as he embraced several drivers with whom he has become close-friends with over the years of lining up on the track alongside one another.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell - who finished eighth overall in Miami - put his arm around Norris as the pair enjoyed a brief moment of friendly conversation together amidst the chaos of post-race procedures and celebrations.\n\nFormer McLaren team-mate and now-RB Formula One Team driver - Daniel Ricciardo - was also pictured looking delighted while sharing a lengthy hug with Norris in the pits.\n\nMcLaren chief, Brown, looked like a father full of pride when he roughly grabbed Norris and hugged his star driver who has finally delivered grand prix success for the team with a stunning win against the odds.\n\nAway from the track and once he has had time to revel in celebrations Stateside, Norris will likely return to Monaco and try to settle back in his usual routine where he leads a sports-obsessed lifestyle aimed at bearing success.\n\nNorris' social media channels shows he is a lover of fast-growing sport Paddel and golf, where he strikes a unique fashion sense as he takes time away from racing.\n\nNorris and McLaren team principal Zak Brown (left) shared an emotional hug after his win\n\nNorris has quickly become a figurehead for McLaren to put their faith into as his Miami victory proves\n\nNorris met with former United States president Donald Trump who is currently trying to rally support ahead of this year's election\n\nNorris starred for McLaren as he passed the chequered flag first at an eventful race in Miami\n\nNorris and his close-friend and Mercedes star George Russell shared a warm brief interaction after his win\n\nThe riches of his McLaren contract reward him with up to \u00a320million-a-year, while his ever-growing profile as a rising social media star - where he often collaborates in videos with celebrity YouTubers - brings further endorsements give him the luxuries you'd expect from a F1 superstar.\n\nSpeaking to Jenson Button after the race yesterday he said: 'About time. F***! Sorry! What a race! It's been a long time coming. Finally, I've managed to do it.\n\n'I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. Long day, tough race. Finally on top, so I'm over the moon. The whole weekend has been good. I've had some little setbacks along the way but I knew on Friday we had the pace.\n\n'Thanks to, everyone. I'll give a shout-out to my mum and dad of course.' Sky quickly apologised after the interview for Norris' hilarious x-rated outburst.\n\nHis time in Formula One is still relatively only at it's beginning and while much has been discussed about Norris' wait for a first victory, much should also be expected from his future as the Brit begins to purr inline with McLaren's improvements that are making them more competitive with each and every passing race.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarida_Corceiro", "type": "wiki",

Prior to the weekend's Miami Grand Prix, he had started 109 F1 races and won a grand total of zero. At the 110th attempt, Norris finally delivered on the promise he has shown for years.\n\nAnd, after he held off Max Verstappen in the mighty Red Bull to do it, F1 could not have had a more popular race-winner than the McLaren star. The Dutchman was the first to hail Norris, who he has described as his best friend in the F1 paddock.\n\nAnd compatriots Lewis Hamilton and George Russell also sent their messages of congratulations after he finally joined them on the list of British F1 winners.\n\n\"Hamilton said: \"I am so happy for Lando and McLaren. They have both been doing a great job and they deserve today's victory. It's great to see McLaren so competitive. I also know how special it is to get your first Grand Prix victory, so a big well done to Lando.\"\n\nAnd Mercedes team-mate Russell added: \"A massive well done to Lando and McLaren. He truly deserves it and, all told, he probably deserves to have more than one victory already by now. We've been racing each other for a long time. He's put so much hard work in and I had no doubts that he would win in F1. I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nOthers names on the now 21-man list of victorious British F1 drivers include legends like James Hunt, Sir Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill. Norris still has some way to go before he can retire with a legacy like those who have come before him.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It was not the first time this year that Verstappen failed to win - Carlos Sainz took victory in Melbourne in March after the Red Bull star suffered a brake fire.\n\nBut it was the first time in 20 races that anyone has beaten the defending champion in a straight fight. And Norris became only the second non-Red Bull driver to win a race since Russell's maiden victory in 2022. It has been a long time coming for the 24-year-old and McLaren have made great strides over the last 12 months.\n\nRed Bull were too strong for a long time, but McLaren's latest upgrades look to have finally propelled them back into contention. Christian Horner claimed Verstappen's car had damage in Miami, but the Dutchman admitted himself it was negligible. Norris and McLaren beat them on merit and that will be a confidence boost to everyone on the grid not of a Red Bull persuasion. They might even dare to dream that this is the beginning of the end of Verstappen's stranglehold of F1.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackie Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damon Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Mansell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32747573.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He said: \"A good day out. I've got a lot of friends, a good group of friends there so it was a good weekend.\n\n\"Already the next morning, I flew straight to Miami. I enjoyed my days off which is always a nice thing in such a busy schedule.

Unlike in Saturday's Sprint race which he didn't finish, the 24-year-old Brit and his McLaren team brought their best to Miami, ousting world champion Max Verstappen by capitalising on a safety car during the 30th lap.\n\nNorris ended up more than seven seconds clear of the Red Bull driver, who'd won four of the five previous Grands Prix this season and had maintained his 100 per cent record of starting on pole. Verstappen gave a classy response after his rival's victory, saying: \"Lando was flying... He definitely deserves it.\"\n\nBristol-born Norris gleefully thanked his mum Cisca and dad Adam after the race, dedicating the win to his grandma.

He joined the F1 grid in 2019 with McLaren as a 19-year-old, and now in his sixth season and heading into the Miami Grand Prix weekend, the Briton had secured one pole position, stood on the podium 15 times, and driven over 6,000 laps.\n\nAs each driver stopped in the media pen for interviews, nearly every one touched on the same point: It's about time.\n\n\"Well done to Lando,\" Fernando Alonso said. \"First win after so many podiums. I'm really happy for him. Hopefully he (remembers) this day -- the first of many wins.\" The Aston Martin driver wasn't the only one who indicated that this wouldn't be the final victory for the 24-year-old. Max Verstappen said, \"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last. He deserves it today.\"\n\nThe victory came at a crucial moment in the sport.

Verstappen has gone largely unchallenged, building a fairly decent lead race after race. But in Miami this weekend, McLaren took advantage of the chance it got to beat Red Bull in a straight fight. As Norris pulled ahead from Verstappen after the safety cars, it became a matter of fresh tires and clean air beating a wickedly fast car.\n\n\"He's deserving of a race victory probably many, many years ago,\" Mercedes' George Russell said. \"And I think for all the drivers in Formula One in this era of dominance from one team and one driver, it's always great to see somebody get that chance to score a victory.\"\n\nNorris started last year's Miami GP 16th and finished P17 for a struggling McLaren, which turned its season around in the second half of 2023. Now, it has its first win in three years. Oscar Piastri said he was \"very happy for (Norris) and for the whole team, and I think we deserve it. Our trajectory in the last 12 months has been towards this moment.\"\n\nLewis Hamilton reminisced about his first F1 victory, which also was with McLaren, back in 2007. The team still has \"a big part of my heart,\" he said, and was happy to see them win again. The Woking-based crew's last F1 victory was with Daniel Ricciardo at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nBefore doing post-race interviews, it's traditional for drivers to chat with their team briefly, crew members patting them on the helmet or back. Norris, though, launched himself over the barrier in joy, McLaren crew members equally as happy to embrace their new race winner. The emotion was overflowing.\n\n\"I'm just really happy for Lando. As much as we all want to beat each other and to come out on top, it's always emotional to see so many emotions in one of your competitors,\" Ferrari's Charles Leclerc said. \"We have all grown up together. I remember looking at Lando when he was in KF3, and we all had this same dream of being a Formula One driver someday.\"\n\nNorris is no a stranger to hate, memes and nicknames like \"Lando No Wins\" popping up on social media as people discuss his record. But the Briton says the words from those closest to him hold more meaning, and thanked his competitors for their praise and support. In parc ferme and the media pen, different drivers embraced Norris, congratulating him on this moment he'll likely remember forever.\n\n\"As much as when you put the helmet on, you hate them, and you want to beat them, and you don't care who's who, I've always had respect for the people I've raced against. So when anyone comes up [to me], especially people who have achieved a lot, because it always means a little bit more,\" Norris said. \"So when Lewis, Fernando, Max, Charles, Carlos, whenever they come up to you or people have good words for you, I appreciate those things a lot. Because from these people, it means something. Maybe from others, it doesn't.\n\n\"From these people, they're the people who know what it takes to achieve these types of things for the work, the time, the effort that goes into doing something like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_coleman@theathletic.com", "name": "Madeline Coleman", "type": "author",

And it was set to be the same again, as the irrepressible Dutchman took victory in the sprint race and claimed pole position - albeit by just a tenth - which he seemed certain to convert.\n\nThe course of the race's events were changed irrevocably by the fleeting contact of two bits of tyre matter. Kevin Magnussen's racing equivalent of 'leaving a foot in' with his challenge against Logan Sargeant for minor placings fired the American into the Turn 2 barrier and sounded the clarion call for a safety car.\n\nLando Norris, who had yet to make his first stop and had gone long, was the primary benefactor. Owing to the timing of the safety car, his eventual switch to the hard tyre effectively came for free and ensured he retained a lead over Verstappen. But we've been here before: Verstappen usually finds his way through, and it was that conditioned sense of inevitability that made the final 20 laps so compelling. But the threat of a challenge seemed to evaporate, and Norris kept building a lead that proved more than enough to claim a first F1 win.\n\nThe 2024 Miami Grand Prix will forever be \"that first Norris win\", but there was far more to it than that. Indulge us, if you will, as we pick our way through the 10 biggest talking points from Florida.\n\nIt was the result that dispelled The Ghost of Sochi 2021.\n\nMcLaren and Norris had never been allowed to forget the precipitous downpour that produced their collective fumble on that day in Russia, particularly as the agonising wait for retribution had lingered far beyond anything that the team had anticipated. Difficulties in its early interpretations of the 2022-spec regulations suggested that Norris had been too loyal to McLaren, especially when 2023's awful start came to bear. It seemed like he'd missed the boat.\n\nUnder the guidance of Andrea Stella, McLaren has turned the ship around. Equally, Norris kept himself in the game in Miami; an early phase of tyre saving ensured that the Briton could extend his stint, which ultimately yielded the safety car-assisted pitstop on lap 29 that kept him ahead of Verstappen.\n\nThe two drivers were evenly matched in the second and third sectors, barely separated by 0.1s through those splits each lap, but it was the opening sector where Norris could focus on his break-building. He was usually 0.3s faster than the Red Bull driver in the opening array of corners, which kept their interval timings steadily growing by each lap, and precluded Verstappen from mounting any kind of fightback during the race's second act.\n\nThankfully, Norris' win will now quell the Twitter comics, at least those who noticed that \"No-wins\" is vaguely similar to \"Norris\".\n\nOn race pace terms, McLaren can make a genuine claim that it had the fastest chassis in Miami. Norris waltzed away from Verstappen, while Oscar Piastri relegated the Ferraris by a position through an explosive start to the grand prix. That's a huge turnaround over the past 12 months, at the start of which the team was lucky to even score points.\n\nEver since Zak Brown entrusted the keys to the erudite Stella, the team's fortunes have only progressed; a clear philosophy in the technical department's direction has ensured that upgrades have been continual despite the cost cap's restrictive effects.\n\nUpgrades don't always work for a variety of reasons: perhaps the correlation between wind tunnel and the real world isn't particularly strong, or a team's turbulence models aren't advanced enough, or reliability has been hampered in some way. In McLaren's case, however, it seems that upgrade packages will bring tangible performance benefits without fail.\n\nThe Austria bolt-ons last year turned the season around, and further additions in Singapore helped keep pace with the other frontrunners. In pure lap-time terms, McLaren lost a little to Red Bull at the start of 2024, but that was because Red Bull had long since stopped developing its 2023 machinery and saved the bigger steps for the new car.\n\nFor the Miami round, McLaren brought a wide-ranging suite of aero updates to its MCL38, including a new front wing, front suspension, sidepod inlets, floor, and rear wing geometries. Norris got the full kit while Piastri had half of it, giving the team a chance to perform back-to-back tests, but it was impressive to see that the team got the new aero dialled in with just a single practice session. With more time to explore the changes in Imola, can McLaren extract even more?\n\nThose expecting Verstappen to put Norris under scrutiny on the lap 33 race restart probably figured that the race was over when the Dutchman threw a speculative attack into the first corner, but Norris saw the championship leader coming and shielded himself against any further efforts into the next corners.\n\nIt was like watching the knight defend the Holy Grail at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade; Verstappen (the grail knight) swiped once, was evaded by Norris (Indiana Jones), and then rather fell over under the weight of his own sword. Norris continued to pad out his lead over the final 20 laps - a tenth here, a couple of tenths there - as insurance, which ultimately proved excessive at the flag.\n\nBut why couldn't Verstappen close the gap? The driver himself reckoned that his RB20 struggled to extract much in the way of grip from the hard compound tyre; the stint on the mediums had been satisfactory, but the white-walled C2 did not mesh with the Red Bull's Miami set-up.\n\nEven though he reckoned that his lap 20 bollard-bothering antics had not caused any damage, team principal Christian Horner reckoned that the liberated road-side marker had \"done quite a lot of damage to the underside of the car.\"\n\n\"We will have to look at exactly what the effect of that was. It is a reasonable amount of the area around the left rear floor,\" Horner said. \"There is a reasonable amount that's missing and you can see it awfully flexing as well, so it certainly wouldn't be helping.\"\n\nTwo and a half laps was all Charles Leclerc managed during practice in Miami. A languid spin out of the Turn 14-15 chicane put the Monegasque's blue-tickled Ferrari the wrong way around, and it proved difficult to perform a recovery pirouette given the tightness of the walls at Turn 16. Thus began the references to the first film in the Austin Powers franchise, when Mike Myers' snaggletoothed British spy parody attempts to perform a 4000-point turn, but Leclerc's efforts did not last as long. He overheated the clutch and couldn't engage reverse, forcing him to clamber out of his car.\n\nMinimal preparation before sprint qualifying proved no obstacle, however, as Leclerc plonked his car on the front row of the grid and kept Verstappen somewhat honest throughout the 19-lap race to claim second. His form continued into the full grand prix and again clinched second on the grid, although the interloping McLarens appeared to have an edge on race pace over the Ferraris.\n\nAlthough Leclerc reckoned that Ferrari might have enjoyed a veneer-thin tyre advantage over Red Bull in Miami, judging by his post-sprint comments, he wasn't able to entirely keep pace with Verstappen at the start. This let Piastri trickle past and stunt the Ferraris' progress early on into the race, although Leclerc's earlier stop ensured that he could undercut the Australian for the race's second half.\n\nRace weekends have been compromised before by limited practice, but Leclerc shook that off and performed when it mattered. And all of that while his drinks bottle wasn't working...\n\nThe radio traffic emerging from Carlos Sainz's car is usually chock-full of insights, ranging from the strategic to the 'brave' renditions of Sade's 1984 hit Smooth Operator. This weekend, the radio waves were an insight into his frustration, which belied his usually calm demeanour as he hit out at a close-quarters battle with Piastri.\n\nSainz attempted to hang his car around the outside of Piastri at Turn 11, a move that the Australian repelled but also left Sainz to take to the run-off. It was a robust defence and one that the stewards ultimately proved to be happy with, but Sainz tasked his engineer Riccardo Adami with getting McLaren on the blower to get Piastri to give the place up. McLaren ran Piastri through its own series of events, perhaps worried that the Melburnian's laid-back nature might not be assertive enough in pleading its case, but it never came to that.\n\nFrustrated by the decision (one that probably led countryman Fernando Alonso to assume it was down to being Spanish), Sainz gave Piastri little quarter in their future battles, which led to contact at Turn 17 that killed off Piastri's podium hopes. After going a bit long into the tight left-hander, Sainz gave Piastri nowhere to go and nibbled at his front wing, forcing the McLaren driver to make a stop.\n\nFor someone who's usually spot on with his tactical talk, Sainz showed a few lapses in his judgement in Miami; dictating strategy is one thing, but it's best to leave the penalty lobbying in the pitwall's hands.\n\nNow that Alpine has shed about 10kg off its A524, the car is now operating at the weight limit for the first time this season. Although the team still has a way to go to be considered competitive, it now sits above Williams and Sauber in the constructors' championship thanks to Ocon's points-scoring exploits in Miami.\n\nThe Frenchman survived a robust onslaught from team-mate Pierre Gasly on the opening lap, although it did cost Ocon two positions. Gasly wanted to be the driver on the \"optimum\" strategy as, per his words, the lesser-placed driver would have to take the Hail Mary strategy in the event of a safety car and go long. Ocon was thus saddled with the latter option, but it worked out perfectly when it came to the bollard-enforced virtual safety car period.\n\nOnce everything had cycled out post-safety car, Ocon had shuffled up to ninth and spent a good while keeping former team-mate Alonso at bay to maintain the two points on offer. The veteran Spaniard eventually found a way past on the run to Turn 11, scything ahead to put Ocon down to 10th, but it nonetheless got Alpine off the mark in a difficult 2024 thus far.\n\n\"We don't want to be jumping around and celebrating too hard,\" Ocon said afterwards. \"Obviously, it's only a top 10. But considering where we were a couple of races ago in Bahrain, 19th and 20th, I think, you know, we can take the positives out of this race and the baby steps that we are doing at the moment. But it definitely feels good to come out of this weekend with some reward.\"\n\nThe 2024 season has been pretty prolific in its bombshell news stories thus far, and Adrian Newey's confirmed departure from Red Bull in 2025 is just another storyline in F1's microcosmic soap opera. The whys, wherefores, and what's nexts have been digested in terms of Newey's future employment - but the ramifications for Red Bull will take longer to fully understand.\n\nThe departure of Newey will at least clarify his involvement in the car design over the past few seasons. Should the Milton Keynes team remain F1's top dog, then the likes of Pierre Wache, Ben Waterhouse, Enrico Balbo and co deserve their flowers. If not, then Newey's star continues to twinkle as brightly as it did 25 years ago. He won't be involved in the team's 2026 design, so we'll only find out then.\n\nFurthermore, will anyone follow Newey out of the exit door? McLaren CEO Brown predicted that \"more dominos\" would fall, citing an increase in CVs on his desk from Red Bull employees. Verstappen looks set to remain at the team, even if Mercedes would like to find a way to spring him from his current deal. Instead, reports are that sporting director Jonathan Wheatley is casting his net out for a possible team principal opportunity, while Wache has been linked to Ferrari more than once over the past couple of years.\n\nRed Bull is currently in the process of revisiting its current contracts to keep its key players at the team, having already locked down Balbo and Waterhouse in recent months.\n\nWhen Newey's departure was announced, the most compelling destinations appeared to be either Ferrari or Aston Martin. At Maranello, Frederic Vasseur is attempting to build a Ferrari team comparable to that of the early 2000s and return the Prancing Horse to the field's forefront - and Newey might be viewed as a shortcut to that level of success.\n\nIn the meantime, Aston Martin has grand ambitions and financial security from owner Lawrence Stroll, who is believed to have tabled a large offer for Newey's services. McLaren and Mercedes are understood not to be interested, preferring to stick with their own philosophies, so it seemingly comes down to whether Newey wishes to relocate to Italy and join Ferrari, or stay in the UK for Aston Martin.\n\nOr there's the romantic option: a return to Williams. Newey departed Williams in 1996 after a variety of fractures in his relationship with both Frank Williams and Patrick Head, particularly after signing a deal that he would also be consulted on major decisions at the team - including driver selection. When it became apparent Damon Hill was not going to be renewed for 1997 and Williams would sign Heinz-Harald Frentzen instead, Newey had not been consulted and chose to leave the team for McLaren.\n\nPerhaps going back to Williams would offer the opportunity he wanted 28 years ago: a genuine say in how the team operates, with scope for a shareholding should owners Dorilton sanction that.\n\n\"It would be remiss of me to not be talking to him. It is as simple as that,\" said Williams principal James Vowles. \"I think we also have to be sensible about it. Our conversations with him have been very light. But even so, are we in discussions? Yes. Very light discussions. But to answer your question, would it be a dream team? Yes.\"\n\nThree 10-second penalties for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, added to a five-second track limits penalty, equalled a grand total of the stewards' ire at Magnussen (and 35 seconds added to his sprint race time, for those with extreme maths allergies). The Dane even admitted that he might have overdone his defence against Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's 19-lap event, but he wasn't quite done with his penalty gathering.\n\nPerhaps sensing that a few more stamps on his FIA card might entitle him to a free coffee, Magnussen buzzed around Sargeant and attempted to pass the American in the opening corners on the 28th lap. Instead, he hooked Sargeant's right-rear wheel with his left-front and posted the Floridian into the wall to produce the safety car.\n\nThat was worth another 10-second penalty, but that wasn't quite it - Magnussen then took to the pitlane under the safety car but did not change his tyres, which comes with a 20-second penalty for the presumed potential disruption to others. Post-Miami, Magnussen now has 10 points on his license - another two will result in a race ban.\n\n\"It wasn't a good day, again,\" Magnussen mused. \"Hopefully I can get some clarity on things going forward.\"\n\nWhen Verstappen made his prodigious entrance into the F1 arena as a race driver at the grand old age of 17, the FIA tightened up its superlicence requirements to stop drivers skipping rungs on its carefully curated ladder to F1. It also upped the minimum age limit needed to hold a superlicence to 18.\n\nIt emerged over the Miami weekend that the FIA had received a request to grant Mercedes young driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli a superlicence, even though he only reaches 18 in August. It may be that this could simply ensure that the Italian can participate in FP1 sessions at some point in 2024, but has led to speculation that Williams might be angling for a replacement for Sargeant should the Fort Lauderdale-born driver continue to struggle.\n\nAntonelli has been granted test days in old Mercedes machinery, as the Brackley squad attempts to give him ample preparation for a future F1 opportunity, but James Vowles says that Williams is committed to sticking with Sargeant.\n\n\"I know nothing about what's going on with the Mercedes tests right now,\" said Vowles. \"We are looking, as everyone else is, for where we want to be on driver line-up for next year. And we have our own young driver programme.\n\n\"Logan has to earn his seat and at the moment, he has some tough targets where he has to get much closer to Alex. But there is nothing on the radar at the moment for replacing him.\"", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was a long day and a tough race. But I'm finally on top, so I'm over the moon,' Lando Norris says.\n\nMIAMI -- Formula 1 needed something special to happen at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix to renew interest in its sport in America. A McLaren driver, Lando Norris, did his part by winning his first career F1 race, ending Max Verstappen's winning streak and loosening Red Bull's dominance at least for the moment.\n\nTo say Mr. Norris's victory was popular is an understatement. The first person to congratulate him was Mr. Verstappen, winner of 21 of the previous 23 F1 races and the victor in the first two Miami Grand Prix and its Spring Race on Saturday.\n\n\"I finally managed to do it,\" Mr. Norris told Sky Sports after the first win of his five-year career as a McLaren driver. \"I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. It was a long day and a tough race. But I'm finally on top, so I'm over the moon.\"\n\nThe 21st driver from the United Kingdom to win a Formula 1 race, Mr. Norris delivered in a big way. After starting fifth and dropping to sixth, he assumed the lead when Mr. Verstappen pitted on the 24th lap of the 57-lap race and never relinquished it, increasing his advantage with every lap.\n\nHis McLaren led by 5.8 seconds after 50 laps, 6.6 seconds after 54 laps, and 7.3 seconds heading into the final lap. By the time he crossed the finish line, Mr. Verstappen was 7.6 seconds behind the winner to finish second, while Charles Leclerc of Ferrari was third.\n\n\"Today we put the perfect strategy together and it all paid off,\" Mr. Norris said, adding, \"A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made some mistakes over the last five years. But today we put it all together. This is all for the team.\"\n\nMr. Verstappen offered no excuses other than his car \"didn't feel fantastic.\" Otherwise, he gave credit to Mr. Norris and the McLaren team. \"Once they switched on to the hard tires they just had more pace, especially Lando,\" Mr. Verstappen said. \"He was flying.\"\n\nThe Dutchman seemed ecstatic for Mr. Norris, the 24-year-old who had retired from the Sprint Race on Saturday. \"I'm very happy for Lando,\" he said. \"It's been a long time coming. And this isn't going to be his last race. He definitely deserves it.\"\n\nMcLaren implemented 10 upgrades to its car for the race and earned the team's first victory since Monza in 2021, prompting a huge celebration. \"I guess this is how it's done,\" Mr. Norris said during his victory lap around the 19-turn, 3.4-mile Miami International Autodrome. \"I came into this morning and said today is the day.\"\n\nIt was exactly the kind of goose-bump finish Formula 1 needed at Miami to inject interest into the sport. The dominance of Mr. Verstappen and Red Bull has negatively affected television ratings in America.\n\nAccording to figures provided by ESPN, through the first five races in 2024, its telecasts averaged 728,000 viewers. That's down from 1.11 million average viewers who watched the 22 races during the 2023 season on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC. The 2023 viewership was slightly less than a record average of 1.21 million in 2022.\n\nWith events in Japan and Communist China moved to the early part of the season, three of the five races this year -- Japan, China, and Australia -- were during overnight hours, while races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia were held on Saturdays instead of Sundays. Bahrain with 1.12 million has attracted the top viewership thus far, while Japan -- 484,000 -- had the lowest.\n\nMr. Verstappen's dominance has played a part in the decline in television ratings. Few want to see the same winner week after week. The only race the Dutchman hadn't won this year was at Australia, where he did not finish due to engine failure. Carlos Sainz of Ferrari won with teammate Mr. Leclerc finishing second.\n\nNow someone has beaten Mr. Verstappen legitimately.\n\n\"They came with upgrades and it looked like it worked,\" Mr. Verstappen said. \"So we have a bit of work to do on our side. I think it definitely wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyze it all and try to come back stronger.\"\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix is the first of three Formula 1 races in America this year. The U.S. Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas at Austin, Texas, is on October 20 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix returns on November 23.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

But the 24-year old British driver insisted he woke up Sunday morning and \"knew\" he was at long last going to be standing highest on the winner's podium.\n\nHe and his McLaren Racing team played the race strategy perfectly with Norris benefitting from a timely mid-race caution flag to take the lead from pole-winner Max Verstappen and then motored off to his first career F1 victory in 111 race starts. He posted an impressive 7.6-second win over the two-time defending race winner, the three-time and reigning world champion Verstappen. It marks only the second time in the season's six races that Verstappen has not stood atop the highest podium position.\n\nAt one point with less than 10 laps remaining and a more than 5-second lead, Norris joked with his team on the radio, \"Am I still alive?\"\n\nAfter taking the checkered flag and while making his cool-down lap at the 3.363-mile Miami International Autodrome, the popular young driver simply screamed with joy over the team radio. The sold-out crowd stood on its feet appreciating the moment.\n\n\"I love you all, I love you all, thank you so much - we did it, we did it,'' Norris yelled, adding, \"I guess that's how it's done. Finally. I'm so happy.''\n\nNorris insisted he had a good feeling about the day: \"I knew it. When I came in this morning, I said today's the day and I nailed it.'' Then he immediately thanked his mom and dad and said \"this one's for my grandma. Thank you very much.''\n\nAfter climbing out of his car, a grinning Norris ran over to his awaiting team and jumped high into their arms where he was hoisted around. It was McLaren's first victory in a decade and such a popular win, even the runner-up Verstappen came right over to congratulate Norris.\n\n\"You win and you lose, I think we're all used to that in racing,'' said the Oracle Red Bull driver Verstappen who has won 38 of the last 49 races, but whose car did not respond as he had hoped. \"Once I heard the lap times the McLarens were doing, I thought, man, that's pretty quick.\n\n\"If a bad day is P2, I'll take it,'' he added with a smile. \"I'm very happy for Lando ... it's been a long time coming and this won't be his last one. He definitely deserves it today.''\n\nScuderia Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished third - his second podium finish in the three Miami races. The timing of the safety car also hurt Leclerc, but he said he was satisfied with salvaging a third place considering the circumstances. \"P3 was the best we could do,'' Leclerc said. \"I am really happy for Lando, he's been very close to it [winning].''\n\nLeclerc's teammate, Carlos Sainz, finished fourth and Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez was fifth.\n\nAMG-Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton was sixth - the highest he's finished in eight races. Yuki Tsunodo, with the Red Bull junior team, was seventh, Mercedes' George Russell was eighth with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Alpine's Estaban Ocon rounding out the Top-10 - all scoring championship points. It is the first point of the season for the Alpine team.\n\nMore: British driver Abbi Pulling sweeps F1 Academy women's races at Miami Grand Prix\n\nThe only American competing in Formula One, Pompano Beach's Logan Sargeant, 23, was eliminated from competition after his Williams Racing car was hit and sidelined by Haas Formula One driver Kevin Magnussen's car midway through the race.

And his first words were for his race engineer Will Joseph, who confirmed to the 24-year-old that his boyhood dream had finally become a reality.\n\n\"We did it, Will!\" Norris screamed, his delighted expression obvious even underneath his helmet. He stepped out of his McLaren to a roar of approval from the Miami crowd and got a big hug from his great friend Max Verstappen.\n\nNorris benefitted from a well-timed safety car which came out after the Dutchman had pitted for fresh tyres. Previous experience suggested the Red Bull would roar past from the moment the race resumed.\n\nBut he held Verstappen off heading into the first corner and never looked back from there. McLaren gave him a massive upgrade package for this weekend and the timing was perfect as Norris had the car he needed to not only match the race pace of the Red Bull, but better it.\n\n\"About time, huh?\" He began in his post-race interview. He then dropped an F-bomb before apologising, aware he was speaking on live TV to millions around the globe.\n\nNorris then said: \"What a race. It's been a long time coming but finally I've managed to do it. \"I'm so happy for my whole team - I've finally delivered for them.

In doing so, he has also beaten Nico Rosberg in an unofficial 'race', which the two agreed to compete in after Norris' P2 finish in China.\n\nRosberg reminded Norris that it took him 111 attempts to win a race in F1. He said,\n\n\"So we have a race, the two of us because you're at 108 and I won when I was at 111 my first race so we're close.\"\n\nNorris agreed to this challenge, and said that his time \"was coming\". Fast forward to the 2024 Miami GP and it did come. Norris won a Grand Prix on his 110th attempt, thus beating Rosberg by 1 race.\n\nNorris beat another former World Champion in a similar 'race' after his victory in Miami. 2009 Title winner Jenson Button finished P1 after 113 starts, and Norris did the same three races prior.\n\nHowever, the 24-year-old won't care about the statistics. Now that he has won a race, what happened in the past and how long it took won't matter because his slate is clean. Norris' hopes now lie in the future, as he looks to make winning F1 races a regular habit.\n\nNorris' Miami GP weekend did not get off to a brilliant start, and after his DNF in the Sprint, things got worse. Starting P5 from the Grid for the Grand Prix, Norris was not one of the favorites to take the chequered flag first.\n\nDespite losing one position at the start, the 24-year-old stayed cool and kept his head down. Once his medium compounds were fired up, he showed brilliant speed and tire management. After extending his stint on the mediums for 28 laps, a safety car incident forced by Kevin Magnussen became key.\n\nHis team's decision to pit him last ultimately put the ball in his court. Norris was the fastest driver on the track on his amply warmed-up hards at the restart and finished 7.6 seconds ahead of Max Verstappen in P2.

He was a guest of Formula One and of McLaren, whose garage he visited pre-race.\n\nNorris said the 77 year-old was someone for whom \"you have to have a lot of respect\".\n\n\"I didn't see him in the garage, to be honest,\" Norris replied when asked what it was like to have Mr Trump in the McLaren garage pre-race. \"I was busy prepping for the race. But he saw me afterwards, and he came up to congratulate me.\n\n\"So I guess an honour, because whenever you have someone like this, it has to be an honour for them to come up to you, to take time out of their life, to pay their respects for what you've done.\"\n\nNorris added: \"He said he was my lucky charm because it's my (first) win. So I don't know if he's going to come to more races now.\n\n\"But yeah, there are a lot of special people or cool people that have been here this weekend. Donald is someone that you got to have a lot of respect for in many ways. And yeah, for anyone like that who acknowledges what you can go out and do and acknowledges the work ethic that goes into things, you got to be thankful for that. And I was. So yeah, a cool moment. And that's all.\"\n\nOn the radio straight after his win, Norris - who is half-English half-Belgian - thanked his parents Cisca Wauman and Adam Norris, and dedicated his victory to his grandmother. In his press conference later, he smiled as he revealed that that his dad, who normally attends his races, had chosen not to come to this one.\n\n\"I'm sure he's regretting that just a little bit now,\" he said. \"But, yeah, I mean, my parents have been so supportive. You know, they're the ones who are with you from the start. They allowed everything to happen. They're the ones that got me into racing, supported me, and allowed me to get to Formula 1, reach my dream, and do what I've loved to do since I was a kid. And I'm very fortunate for everything that they've done and the position they've allowed me to be in.\n\n\"So you just have these flashbacks of every moment, like... I just remember now being at a racetrack for the very first time in my life when I was five, six years old. My brother, my dad, and me just standing there and watching and just seeing the cars go by, to today, being on top of the podium. You think of those moments, and therefore, of course, I want to speak to my mum and dad, first of all, because you shared all those moments with them. And I just say a big thanks.\n\n\"And for my grandma, because she's not been so well lately. I saw her last week, and I told her that I was going to win a race. I didn't say when. I just said I was going to win a race. I didn't think it would be coming this soon.\"\n\nNorris also thanked the boo boys on social media who, he said, gave him the motivation to keep coming back.\n\n\"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me, I freaking love it,\" Norris said. \"It makes me smile more than anything, especially 'Lando No-wins'. That's become a thing.\n\n\"So yeah, for me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face today. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nThe Briton, who made headlines last week when he cut his nose at a boat party in Amsterdam, finished by saying he would doubtless be enjoying another big night out.\n\n\"I mean, I was meant to fly, but Zak (Brown, McLaren CEO) just told me we fly tomorrow,\" he replied when asked how he was going to celebrate.\n\n\"I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way. I might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow, but I don't care. I'll enjoy my time. This only happens once when you're taking your first win. It's nice to do it here in Miami.

I think the other dads, I just had Lewis' dad [Anthony Hamilton] give me a text. And we've been through a lot, and it's interesting knowing as a parent, how many hours you've put in, supporting them.\"\n\nIn his first 109 starts for McLaren (since making his debut in 2019), Lando Norris failed to win a race despite standing on the podium 15 times.

Another person who knows how much work it takes to succeed is Lewis Hamilton's father Anthony.\n\nAnthony Hamilton has always been at the forefront, congratulating other drivers for their success on the track, and he taught Lewis the same values.

This event marked Norris's first win in Formula 1, signaling a potential shift in the competitive dynamic of the sport.\n\nThe 2024 Miami Grand Prix turned out to be a watershed moment for McLaren, as their star driver, Lando Norris, clinched his first ever Formula 1 victory. Starting from the fifth position, Norris managed to navigate through a race filled with strategic depth, ultimately coming out on top. His win not only brought joy to the McLaren team but also sparked comments from competitors, notably Max Verstappen, who acknowledged the potential shift in the grid's competitive hierarchy due to McLaren's performance.\n\nThe race itself was a spectacular showcase of strategic acumen and the skill of the young Brit. Early in the race, Norris was held back by a resilient Charles Leclerc, while a near lock-up from Sergio Perez added to the initial mixup of the grid. The pivotal moment came when a crash involving Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant brought out the safety car, providing McLaren with the opportunity to execute a flawlessly timed pit stop. This strategic move propelled Norris into the lead, ahead of the pack.\n\nPost-safety car, Norris demonstrated exceptional race craft, keeping the reigning world champion Max Verstappen at bay, despite the latter's attempts to regain the lead. Norris's ability to manage his race pace against some of the season's strongest competitors underscored his maturity and skill as a driver.\n\nAfter the race, an elated Norris shared his feelings,\n\n\"I've finally delivered for the team. About time. It's been a long time coming, but finally, I've done it. I'm over the moon,\" Norris said. He praised his team's weekend efforts, \"The whole weekend has been good. I've had little setbacks along the way. I knew on Friday I had the pace, today we managed to put it together with the perfect strategy. I'm just proud.\"\n\nOn the other side, Max Verstappen, while congratulatory, did not hide his apprehension about McLaren's performance,\n\n\"You win, you lose. I think we're all used to that in racing, right? Today was just a bit tricky. I think already on the mediums, it didn't feel fantastic.

The third edition of the Miami Grand Prix lived up to the reputation with an exhilarating race that saw history in the making. Lando Norris couldn't have chosen a better venue to register his first-ever Formula One race, edging the dominant Max Verstappen to secure the victory.\n\nThe British-Belgian racer defeated Red Bull's three-time F1 champ with help from the safety car to seal his maiden win. Norris took advantage of a red-flag situation when a safety car was deployed at about half a distance.\n\nThe McLaren driver moved to the front row after making a pit stop just when others had already stopped. There was no stopping him from that moment on as Verstappen, who started from the pole position, couldn't catch him with 27 laps to go. The Dutch racer had to settle for second ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n\nBut before the drama unfolded at the circuit, a popular figure had already stolen the limelight. Donald Trump, the former president of the United States of America, received a huge welcome from the fans as he waved to the F1 enthusiasts from the paddock of Norris' McLaren.\n\nIt was a landmark day for Lando Norris, who finally secured his maiden victory in his 110th grand prix. In doing so, he became the 114th driver to win a grand prix in Formula One history.\n\nIt was not just luck and timing, Norris' win was based on genuine pace.

He's very skilled and he's a team player.\n\n\"I expect to see him winning more over the years to come and I just hope it's sooner rather than later so we can have a fight between Red Bull and McLaren.\"\n\nSimilarly, Danica Patrick doesn't think Norris' victory will \"change a whole lot\" because it was something that was inevitable.\n\n\"Sometimes you learn how to win,\" she added. \"You have the right mentality for it and everybody pictures you that way, seeing you that way which can have its own momentum and energy.\n\n\"I am not sure it really changes a whole lot because we saw it coming. He's almost won many times and everybody believes he's going to win so many more, eventually a championship.

We did it!\"\n\nBefore his win in Miami, Norris held the record for the most times on the podium in F1 -- a whopping 15 -- without a race win.\n\nNorris, who began club level karting in 2008, was the youngest ever British Formula 1 driver when he hit the track at the 2019 Australian GP at age 19. He's also added several other records to his resume, including becoming the youngest World Championship winner at the CIK-FIA KF World Championships in 2014.\n\nIn September 2018, he was announced as a driver for McLaren in the 2019 Formula 1 World Championship. Three years later, he signed a new contract with McLaren through at least 2025.\n\nKeep scrolling to get to know Norris:\n\nNorris, who was born in November 1999, hails from Bristol, England. He is the second child of parents Adam and Cisca, who also share older son Oliver and younger daughters Flo and Cisca.\n\nNorris began club level karting in 2008. \"His potential was clear for all to see and his enjoyment at getting behind the wheel was the catalyst for what was to come,\" his website reads.\n\nAfter Gil de Ferran died in December 2023, Norris paid tribute to the 2003 Indianapolis 500 winner.\n\n\"We lost someone really special to us at the end of last year, he was a dear friend of mine and he'd been with me pretty much since I came into Formula 1,\" Norris wrote via Instagram. \"Someone who I not only had many laughs and great times with, but someone who helped me out on and off the track whenever I needed it.\"\n\nAlongside the message, Norris shared a helmet with de Ferran's name. \"This is the design he won the Indy 500 with, and I'll be wearing it today as my little way to say thank you for everything and to let him know we're thinking of him and he's still very much part of McLaren,\" he wrote. \"I hope you like it. This one is for you Gil \u2764\ufe0f.\"\n\nWhen Norris won the Formula 1 Grand Prix in May 2024, he wrote in a joint Instagram post with McLaren, \"We did it. \ud83c\udfc6 And we did it for you, Gil. \ud83e\udde1.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Norris celebrated a big milestone. \"100 races, 100 stickers. Here's to the next 100,\" he wrote via Instagram, alongside a pic of him blowing out a candle on top of his helmet. His win at the Miami Grand Prix in 2024 marked his 110th race.\n\nNorris was all smiles as he attended the October 2023 Ryder Cup, a golf competition, in Italy. \"My first ever Ryder Cup all thanks to @hilton. what a weekend and even better seeing Europe take the w,\" he wrote via Instagram at the time. He also supports sister Flo, who is a champion equestrian.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_hudgins@usmagazine.com", "name": "Ryan Hudgins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_de_Ferran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gil de Ferran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lando-Norris-5-Things-to-Know-inline.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 696, "textEnd": 710}, {"amb": false, "date": "1999-11-", "textStart": 939, "textEnd": 952}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Norris was leading at the time and was able to retain that advantage after stopping for new tyres of his own.\n\nUpon the restart, he had the pace in his McLaren to keep the Red Bull at bay. Not only that, but he stretched out the lead and was more than seven second ahead of Verstappen when he took the chequered flag.\n\nAnd the Dutchman smiled as he admitted he was powerless to stop his friend from beating him. Verstappen said: \"You win, you lose. I think we're all used to that in racing, right? Today was just a bit tricky. I think already on the mediums, I didn't feel fantastic. We were pulling away but not like it should be.\n\n\"And then once we made the pitstop and I heard what lap times that McLaren were doing I thought, 'Wow, that's pretty quick.' Once they also switched on to the hard tyre, they just had more pace, and especially Lando, he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint. But if a bad day is P2, I take it.\"\n\nVerstappen gave Norris a big hug in Parc Ferm\u00e9 after they had climbed out of their cars. And he heaped praise upon the Briton as he expressed his delight that his friend had finally broken his F1 duck at the 110th attempt.\n\nHe said: \"And I'm very happy for Lando.

The 24-year-old said: \"About time, huh?\" before swearing on the live TV broadcast and apologising immediately afterwards.\n\nNorris added: \"What a race.

Unable to continue, the McLaren driver got out and without permission, crossed the track. This could have turned out to be a fatal mistake had another car been around.\n\nIn response, the FIA levied a $53,800 fine on him, out of which half of it will remain suspended until the end of the season. According to Chris Medland, Norris has accepted his mistake and said, \"The situation could have been very dangerous for him.\"\n\nHowever, this wasn't the first time FIA had to deal with such recklessness. During the 2023 Qatar GP weekend, Lewis Hamilton did something similar when he collided with his Mercedes teammate George Russell, and he ended up receiving a similar penalty.\n\nCoincidently, Hamilton was involved in the event that kicked Norris off track in Miami in the first place. The former was charging from behind when he touched Fernando Alonso's right rear. This ultimately propelled Alonso to push his own teammate Lance Stroll, leading to the Canadian making contact with Norris.\n\nHamilton was not punished for the incident which was something Alonso found unacceptable. He even taunted the FIA for not penalizing the 39-year-old 'because he isn't Spanish'. Unfortunately for Norris, he took the final hit.\n\nIn Miami, McLaren came with new upgrades hoping to have a quality weekend. However, Norris' DNF in the Sprint made him lose out on crucial points. His teammate Oscar Piastri, however, finished P6, bringing home three points in consolation.\n\nLuckily for the Woking-based outfit, the final act still awaits, and for that Norris has done a decent job. In Qualifying ahead of the Grand Prix, Norris secured a P5 starting position. It gives the Brit a realistic chance for a podium. But McLaren's main aim would be to score as many points as possible to close the gap to Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship standings.\n\nPiastri will start the Miami GP right behind Norris in P6. Together, McLaren can make a formidable strategy to punch above its weight on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mercedes is also right behind the papaya outfit, and they could be an irritant to the team's plans.\n\nMercedes, however, certainly dealt with grip concerns in Q3.

A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it altogether,\" Norris told Sky Sports afterwards.\n\n\"This is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and do believe in them. Today, we proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris is the 21st driver from the UK to win an F1 race. Sunday's victory was also McLaren's first grand prix victory since 2021 - and second in the last 12 years.\n\nMcLaren CEO Zak Brown was full of praise for Norris after the race, saying the victory was \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"I think this is a very popular win amongst the fans, amongst the drivers... [with] how many drivers went up to him and congratulated him,\" Brown told Sky Sports. \"He drove perfectly, the car was really fast.\"\n\nNorris moves up to fourth in the 2024 driver's championship standings, 53 points behind Verstappen in first place, and the three-time defending drivers' champion was happy to praise the Brit for his maiden race victory.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming, and it's not going to be his last one,\" Verstappen said.\n\nThe F1 season next heads to Italy for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix with the race weekend starting on May 17.\n\nA star-studded affair\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix has quickly become one of the most popular events on the F1 calendar and is now equally as entertaining for the celeb-spotting off the track than the racing on it.\n\nFormer NFL superstar and seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, Blackpink's Lisa, Camila Cabello, Ed Sheeran and actor Anthony Mackie were some of the celebrities in attendance at the Miami International Autodrome over race week.\n\nThere were a host of current athletes in attendance too. The Kansas City Chiefs' star duo of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. and US Olympian Fred Kerley were also there.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump was also among those at the track on race day.\n\nThis year's attendance at the Miami Grand Prix was a sold out 275,000 across the race weekend, according to Formula One. In 2022, the attendance was 230,000.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The McLaren driver defeated Max Verstappen in an action-packed Miami GP, while Charles Leclerc completed the podium in third place.\n\nIt was initially Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri who looked primed to fight Verstappen for the win. An earlier error by Sergio Perez opened the door for Piastri to climb from P6 to P3 off the line, and he later passed Leclerc to moved up to P2. Norris, on the other hand, had a slow start and was running P6 in the early stages.\n\nOut at front, while Verstappen settled into the lead, he didn't pull off his characteristic early gap. The race played into Norris' hands when the Safety Car was brought out on Lap 28, following an incident involving Logan Sargeant and Kevin Magnussen.\n\nThe Safety Car was deployed just as Norris crossed the line, allowing him to pit for fresh tyres and rejoin the race in the lead. He fended off Verstappen at the re-start and starting pulling away at front as the Red Bull driver encountered balance problems. At the end, Norris crossed the chequered flag with a 7.612 secs advantage over Verstappen.\n\n\"About time! It's been a long time coming, but we've finally managed to do it. I'm so happy for the whole team, and what we've achieved together,\" said Norris, who has scored McLaren's first win since the 2021 Italian GP.\n\n\"We've had a few little setbacks across the weekend, but today we managed to put it all together. The car was great, the strategy was perfect, and I'm over the moon. I'm proud of everyone in this team today. I've always believed in them, and they've always had faith in me, and today we've really justified that.\"\n\nLeclerc finished third ahead of his Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz. However, Sainz was later handed a five-second time penalty for causing a collision with Piastri. This dropped him to P5 and promoted Perez to fourth place.\n\nLewis Hamilton and George Russell salvaged some points for Mercedes, finishing P6 and P8, respectively.

And he squandered the chance of victory in Qatar last year.\n\nMiami was his 110th race and he struck a little fortunate in the sunshine state as he was able to pit while a safety car was deployed, meaning he was able to hold onto his lead.\n\nNorris, 24, was still tasked with fending off the dangerous Max Verstappen, who was struggling with his car having hit a bollard earlier in the race.\n\nBut Norris' victory was well deserved and will be a popular one, with the McLaren star one of the most well-liked drivers in the sport.\n\nIt is also a welcome return to the top step of the podium for his team, who last tasted victory in Monza in 2020 and presented Norris with a new deal earlier this season.\n\nNorris joined McLaren's young driver programme in February 2017 after a successful junior career, and has now reached the pinnacle of motorsport.\n\nHere we take a look inside his amazing lifestyle and his rise to the pinnacle of F1.\n\nDriving career\n\nNorris was a successful kart racer in his youth, winning three competitions alone in 2013 including CIK-FIA European Championship -- KFJ.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nHe made the move away from karting the following year and continued to impress with several first-place finishes.\n\nNorris first began to grab headlines with success in Formula 2, finishing second overall in 2018 when part of Carlin.\n\nHe then joined McLaren and made his F1 debut in 2019, featuring in 21 races that year.\n\nThe Bristol-born driver achieved his first podium a year later, before making pole for the first and only time in 2021.\n\nHe is on course to record his best season to date, with the 2023 campaign his best so far after picking up 205 points to finish in sixth place overall.\n\nHomes\n\nLike his compatriot Lewis Hamilton and many other F1 drivers, Norris lives in Monaco after moving to the French Riveira last year.\n\nExplaining the decision to move to the tax haven, he said: \"I'm moving to Monaco after [the final race in] Abu Dhabi for the reasons you probably expect.\n\n\"It's something that obviously a lot of drivers go to do.\n\n\"And especially with how racing is - I think you've seen it with a lot of the drivers, how quickly things can also go downhill.\"\n\nHe previously lived in Surrey near McLaren's base in Woking, and is understood to still own a stunning \u00a320m mansion in the area.\n\nSalary\n\nNorris is one of the highest earners in the paddock after penning a deal to extend his stay to 2026.\n\nThe pay rise is believed to have increased his earnings to an eye-watering \u00a320million a year, with the contract worth \u00a380m in total.\n\nOnly Verstappen, Hamilton and Charles Leclerc are paid more.\n\nGirlfriends\n\nAs well as fame and fortune, F1 can offer its stars opportunities to meet glamorous girlfriends, and that is exactly what Norris has been able to do.\n\nHe is rumoured to be dating Margarida Corceiro, having first been spotted with the Portuguese model and actress in public last year.\n\nHowever neither have posted photos with one another on social media with their apparent relationship taking place in private.\n\nNorris previously dated model Luisinha Oliveira between August 2021 and September 2022, but the pair were subject to abuse and death threats from trolls.\n\nFamily\n\nNorris' father Adam, 51, is one of the wealthiest Brits with an estimated fortune of \u00a3200m.\n\nHe is a retired pensions manager and is often seen in the paddock supporting his son.\n\nHis mother Cisca is from the Flanders region of Belgium, and Norris has two younger sisters, one also named Cisca and the other Flo, as well as an older brother called Oliver.\n\nSupercars\n\nIt is no surprise a keen petrolhead has the garage to match his love for driving.\n\nNorris has plenty of cars in his collection and was gifted a \u00a3300,000 765LT Spider supercar when he signed his new McLaren contract.\n\nHe was also seen at Silverstone last year in his \u00a31million McLaren Senna, while he's understood to have a \u00a3350,000 Rolls Royce Wraith and a \u00a328,000 Fiat Jolly.\n\nHe also owns a McLaren 720S which is capable of reaching 212mph and can reach 0-60 mph in just 2.8 seconds.\n\nWatches\n\nNorris also has a love for watches and boasts big brands like Rolex and Audemars.\n\nHe is also brand loyal and owns two Richard Mille McLaren timepieces, one of which was stolen from Norris when he attended the Euro 2020 final at Wembley in July 2021.\n\nThe \u00a3144,000 designer watch - a Richard Mille RM11-03 Automated Flyback - has been limited to just 500 pieces worldwide, so is something of a prized asset.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And his first words were for his race engineer Will Joseph, who confirmed to the 24-year-old that his boyhood dream had finally become a reality.\n\n\"We did it, Will!\" Norris screamed, his delighted expression obvious even underneath his helmet. He stepped out of his McLaren to a roar of approval from the Miami crowd and got a big hug from his great friend Max Verstappen.\n\nNorris benefitted from a well-timed safety car which came out after the Dutchman had pitted for fresh tyres. Previous experience suggested the Red Bull would roar past from the moment the race resumed.\n\nBut he held Verstappen off heading into the first corner and never looked back from there. McLaren gave him a massive upgrade package for this weekend and the timing was perfect as Norris had the car he needed to not only match the race pace of the Red Bull, but better it.\n\n\"About time, huh?\" He began in his post-race interview. He then dropped an F-bomb before apologising, aware he was speaking on live TV to millions around the globe.\n\nNorris then said: \"What a race. It's been a long time coming but finally I've managed to do it. \"I'm so happy for my whole team - I've finally delivered for them. It was a long day, a tough race, but I'm finally on top and over the moon.\"\n\nVerstappen is not used to being beaten. Prior to this, he had won every race this year that he had finished. But still he managed a smile after being beaten by his best friend in the F1 paddock.\n\nThe Red Bull racer said: \"You win, you lose, we're all used to that in racing, right? \"Today was tricky... Lando was flying and it was incredibly difficult for us. But if a bad day is P2, I can't complain.\" Charles Leclerc joined them on the podium after a strong drive for Ferrari, but it was all about Norris who proved to everyone that Red Bull are beatable in a straight fight.\n\nAnd McLaren will be excited about what the next few weeks will hold. Oscar Piastri will also get the full set of upgrades when F1 returns to Imola for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix later this month with renewed hope that Red Bull can be beaten.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Joseph_(rugby_union,_born_1877)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Joseph (rugby union, born 1877)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32742454.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Lando-Norris-SKY-SPORTS-050524.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

With 16 podium finishes and eight being for second place, as recently as the previous race in China, Norris had taken on the position of best driver not to have won. In fact, the Sky Sports prerace show even hooked Norris up to a lie detector to which he averred that he would indeed win with McLaren. How prophetic!\n\nMax Verstappen did something that must have confused him: He finished second. He has done so 29 times in his career but only four times in the last three seasons. It is hard to finish second when you are always finishing first. Still, there is no reason to feel bad for Verstappen. He still leads the championship standings 136-101 over teammate Sergio Perez.\n\nCharles Leclerc continued his steady year by taking third, and still not finishing outside the top four. He sits with 98 points and as another driver hoping for Red Bull to display a chink in their formidable armor to score his sixth win.\n\nCarlos Sainz looked like he might have the pace to pass his Ferrari teammate but never made a move and settled for fourth. Much like Leclerc, he has been consistent and has yet to finish outside the top five, but he has had a withdrawal owing to his appendectomy.\n\nPerez followed in fifth after he dive-bombed the leaders at the onset. Starting from fourth, Perez sat in a great position to gain positions but undid his race by barging toward the leaders with little control and going wide at turn 1. After he gathered up his Red Bull and fell in line, Perez fought with Norris for much of the first half of the race. His uneven performance does nothing to dispel rumors that Sainz will be taking over Perez's spot at Red Bull next year. (Ed. Note: Sainz was relegated to fifth after the stewards assessed him a five-second penalty for causing a collision with Oscar Piastri in their post-race review.)\n\nPerhaps Mercedes is starting to stabilize. Or maybe they just put together a decent weekend, but the team still does not resemble the dominant force it had been just four years ago. But credit should be given to Lewis Hamilton for starting eighth and finishing sixth while showing pace to push the cars in front of him. Neither the team nor Hamilton will be challenging for titles this year, and only with a lot of luck might the group win a race, but solid points days from here out are what should set them as the third-best team if they all remain steady.\n\nYuki Tsunoda must be even more disappointed with his DNF in China after scoring points in the Sprint race and finishing seventh in the GP in Miami. He has finished in the points in three of the last four races and is showing the form that was expected from teammate Daniel Ricciardo. Though he holds the 10th position in the standings with 14 points, Tsunoda has earned three-quarters of the team's points and is showing strong form.\n\nGeorge Russell slotted into the eighth spot in what seemed like a quiet and somewhat underperforming day. The points matter, and he brought the car home in one piece, but if he is looking to be the leader at Mercedes next year, he is going to need to show a little more chutzpah.\n\nFernando Alonso messed around in the back half of the field for most of the race before storming into the points during the last 20 laps. His battle with Esteban Ocon lasted a number of laps and provided stirring entertainment as Norris built his gap over Verstappen at the front. The question that remains with Alonso is not his talent but whether or not Aston Martin is getting better or treading water.\n\nHere's the sad stat of the day: By finishing 10th, Ocon provided Alpine with its first point of the 2024 season. That's right, the Alpine Renault works team now has just one point and sits six points behind Haas Ferrari, an organization that has developed the concept of protecting a teammate to the full. See: Magnussen, Kevin; penalties.\n\nThe Race\n\nThe Miami GP looked to have all the hallmarks of another Max Verstappen cruise-and-snooze fest. He sped off into the lead, and with Perez shaking up the front with his enthusiastic start that outdid his talent, the eventual falling in line looked normal.\n\nVerstappen was followed by Leclerc, Piastri, and Sainz. The two Ferraris, donned in their mess of an accented blue livery, seemed to have equal pace, but Piastri soon left the two to go after Verstappen.\n\nPiastri maintained a steady gap to Verstappen, an indication that McLaren was able to bring the fight, leaving the main issue to strategy.\n\nFerrari got in its own way back in the field by not encouraging Leclerc to let Sainz pass to challenge Piastri, while Perez and Norris hounded each other, much like Hamilton and Nico Hulkenberg.\n\nTwo things brought the usual race pattern to an end. First, some teams employed pit strategies that brought in their drivers in on laps in the midteens. This shuffling of the order helped to alleviate what had been a standard processional.\n\nThen came Magnussen on lap 29. If any driver has proven to be a bull in a china shop, it has been Magnussen. Racing at the rear of the field, Magnussen pushed to pass Logan Sargeant, who had been keeping to himself and looking to finish his home GP. Magnussen felt the need to disrupt this notion, pushed his Haas alongside Sargeant at the apex of turn two. Off sailed Sargeant into the barriers, his race over while Magnussen carried on. The incident brought Bert Mylander and his safety car to the track and changed the second half of the race.\n\nNorris, having yet to pit, found himself able to grab fresh tires and rejoin the field at the front - with Verstappen in tow. While normally, this would be the time for Verstappen to, uh, um, Verstompen (?), instead Norris made a clean get away and opened up a gap of over a second two laps after the restart.\n\nFrom there, Norris did what had been expected of him for some time: raced home for the win with a gap of over seven seconds at the finish.\n\nThe Good\n\nThis one is easy. Hat's off to Lando Norris on the win.\n\nNot only did he earn his first victory, but he also showed evidence that McLaren might be able to provide a fight for Red Bull, something the latter has not seen for the last two years.\n\nThe focus, however, should be on Norris and McLaren and for their continued fight. Having given away a race win at Russia a couple of years ago, a Norris win looked inevitable and then unobtainable as the team struggled at various points. This win is the culmination of the two working together and finally finding their moment. Whether or not this opens the proverbial floodgates on more wins will be something to speculate about but for now, they can enjoy the champagne spray.\n\nThe Bad\n\nMagnussen would be the easy target here, and maybe he is worthy of another column that really addresses the strategy of F1 racing in its current form. But for today, and not to pile on, but what is with Daniel Ricciardo?\n\nFollowing his stellar performance in the Sprint race where he finished fourth, Ricciardo could do no better than to qualify in 18th for the GP, while teammate Tsunoda locked into 10th.\n\nFor the race, Ricciardo brought his RB across the line in 15th. On the season, he has yet to finish higher than 12th and has two DNFs to his stat line. So far, this year is hardly serving as evidence that Ricciardo has what it takes to keep his seat.\n\nThe Questionable\n\nFar too often, people decry that sports and politics do not mix or that they should be uncoupled, but that is na\u00efve. Everything is political and it is impossible to separate culture from what birthed it. But that still makes McLaren's decision to host former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump a bit mystifying.\n\nThe reason for making such a comment is that race organizers had already shut down an event planned by Trump supporters that had been tied to the race. That McLaren brought Mr. Trump to the race seemed to be a way of thumbing their noses at race management while also selling the Trump brand.\n\nWhether or not Trump fits what the sport is trying to sell is a question of perspective and optics. Such a spectacle brings attention, but for a country affected by a staunch political divide, moments like this one can be challenging and bring about the wrong talking points from what should be a celebration of Norris' breakthrough.\n\nThe Quotables\n\nGrabbing his first career F1 win, \"About time!\" beamed Lando Norris. \"What a race. It's been a long time coming, but finally I've managed to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I finally delivered for them. A long day, tough race, but finally on top so I'm over the moon.\"\n\nThe second-place finisher offered: \"Once then they also switched onto the hard tire, they just had more pace, especially Lando he was flying,\" said Max Verstappen. \"It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint but if a bad day is P2 I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\"\n\nThe Results\n\nMiami Grand Prix, 2024: Miami International Autodrome, Miami, FL, USA (May 5, 2024)\n\n* Provisional results. Magnussen received a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision. Stroll received a 10-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.", "source": {"uri": "frontstretch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontstretch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Norris moved his way to second as the cars ahead of him made pit stops and was clicking off fast laps on his medium compound tires.\n\nHe took over the lead after Verstappen pitted just before Carlos Sainz and Norris' McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri did. Once Piastri pitted, Norris took over the race lead and was leading the race when Magnussen and Sergeant collided in the first sector.\n\nThe safety car allowed Norris to make his only pit stop of the day and stay ahead of everyone else when he left the pit lane.\n\nSimply put, Norris wouldn't have won the race if the crash hadn't happened when it did. But his win wasn't solely due to the safety car either. Norris pulled a second ahead of Verstappen a lap after the restart and then drove away from the three-time defending world champion over the final 24 laps of the 57-lap race.\n\nNorris is also the first driver not named Verstappen to win a race in Miami. Verstappen entered Sunday's Grand Prix as the winner of the first two races on the circuit around Hard Rock Stadium and won Saturday's sprint race rather easily.\n\nBut Verstappen's car simply didn't have any performance over the final stint of the race. He complained over his radio of a lack of front grip and found himself much closer to third-place finisher Charles Leclerc than Norris by the end of the race.\n\nNorris is just the third driver outside of Verstappen to win a race since the start of the 2023 season. Verstappen won 19 of 22 races a season ago, while his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez got two wins and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz won once. Entering Sunday's race, Sainz was the only driver other than Verstappen to get a win through the first five races of 2024 after Verstappen was forced to retire early from the Australian Grand Prix because of a brake issue.\n\nThe victory is also McLaren's first since 2021 and just the team's second since 2012. Until Sunday, Daniel Ricciardo's win at Monza three seasons ago was the only time in the past 12 seasons that the team had gotten the top step of the podium.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 Formula One World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test driver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/quN5GLCwBA5SlATU1nStSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/51bd9850-0b25-11ef-abf6-7b35ac947007", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

His triumph comes after a strategic race that saw him outpace even Max Verstappen.\n\nThe much-anticipated Miami Grand Prix culminated in a landmark victory for Lando Norris, who, for the first time in his career, topped the podium. This marked not just a personal victory but a significant milestone for the McLaren team, amplified by a brilliant strategy that steered them to the front of the pack during a perfectly timed safety car.\n\nFrom the outset, the race was fraught with tension and excitement. Norris, starting from the fifth position on the grid, demonstrated poise and precision. Key moments that defined the race included a nearly disastrous lock-up from Sergio Perez and a sturdy defense from Charles Leclerc, which initially held Norris at bay. However, strategic decisions during a pivotal safety car intervention, triggered by a crash involving Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant, proved decisive. Norris's team opted for an impeccably timed pit stop that catapulted him into the lead.\n\nPost-safety car, Norris showcased his mettle, fending off early challenges from Max Verstappen and maintaining a steady pace that kept his Red Bull competition at a distance. His ability to manage race pace against the likes of Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc underscored a maturity and race craft that have been budding over the past seasons, now fully realised by a car worth his potential.\n\n\"I've finally delivered for the team,\" Norris remarked in the aftermath. The young Brit's emotions were palpable as he addressed the media. \"About time. It's been a long time coming, but finally, I've done it. I'm over the moon.\n\n\"The whole weekend has been good. I've had little setbacks along the way. I knew on Friday I had the pace, today we managed to put it together with the perfect strategy. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made mistakes over the last five years, but we put it together today. I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them,\" he continued.\n\nThe race was not without its dramas elsewhere.

We're all used to that in racing, right? Today was a bit tricky. I think already on the medium [tyres] it didn't feel fantastic, we were pulling away but not like it should be. Then once we made a pit stop I heard what the lap times McLaren were doing and I was like, 'Well, that's pretty quick!'\" Verstappen said as quoted by Formula 1.\n\n\"Once then they also switched onto the hard tyre, they just had more pace, especially Lando he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint but if a bad day is P2 I take it. I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked if McLaren is showcasing their 'real pace' after a spate of upgrades to their vehicles at the Miami International Autodrome, Verstappen said, \"I hope not! They came with an upgrade, for sure it looks like it works so we have a bit of work to do from our side.\n\n\"I think definitely it wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyse it all and we'll try to come back stronger,\" he added.\n\nDespite losing out on victory, Verstappen has increased his lead in the drivers' standings to 35 points, with nearest championship opponent and teammate Sergio Perez finishing fifth.

Norris had been running sixth in the early stages of the race, but everything changed when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 29 after Kevin Magnussen tangled with Logan Sargeant at Turn 3, sending both into the barriers. Crucially for Norris, he was the only one of the leading runners not to have changed tyres by this point, and was thus able to pit without losing the lead he had inherited as others had pitted, reports Xinhua.

What a race, it's been a long time coming but finally I've been able to do it. I'm so happy for my whole team, I've finally been able to deliver for them.

I knew on Friday we had the pace and just a couple of mistakes here and there but today we managed to put it together, we put the perfect strategy, it all paid off.\"\n\nMcLaren had brought upgrades to Miami, and Norris had shown genuine pace on his way to victory, crossing the line 7.6 seconds ahead of the previously dominant Verstappen. The Dutchman, who had won Saturday's Sprint event and led the early stages of the Grand Prix, also cut the chicane on lap 22 and struck a plastic bollard, with Red Bull saying the incident cost him some performance.\n\nBehind the top two, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc rounded out the top three, with teammate Carlos Sainz fourth after overtaking Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri, who subsequently needed to pit for a new front wing, ruining his chances of points.\n\nVerstappen's teammate Sergio Perez had a low-key run to fifth place, ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in sixth.

Hamilton expressed joy over McLaren's resurgence and Norris's significant achievement.\n\nThe streets of Miami transformed into a festive arena as Lando Norris clinched his maiden Formula 1 victory, prompted Lewis Hamilton to advise the jubilant winner to change his travel plans and bask in the celebrations. Norris, racing for McLaren, showcased exceptional skill and his team strategic acumen to take the top podium spot, marking a monumental moment in his career and a resurgence for the Woking team.\n\nStarting from fifth on the grid, Norris quickly became a focal point of the race, navigating through a field that included a near-miss collision involving Sergio Perez and a staunch defense from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. The race's dynamics dramatically shifted following a crash between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant, which brought out the safety car. McLaren seized this opportunity, making a strategically timed pit stop that catapulted Norris into the lead.\n\nPost-safety car, Norris displayed maturity and precision, holding off a determined challenge from Max Verstappen. His ability to maintain pace and manage the race from the front was a testament to his evolving racecraft and underlined by his personal reflections after securing the win.\n\nNorris said: \"I've finally delivered for the team. About time. It's been a long time coming, but finally, I've done it. I'm over the moon.\" He added, \"The whole weekend has been good. I've had little setbacks along the way. I knew on Friday I had the pace, today we managed to put it together with the perfect strategy. I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made mistakes over the last five years, but we put it together today. I stuck with McLaren because I believed in them.\"\n\nLewis Hamilton, witnessing the young driver's success, was quick to offer both congratulations and a bit of festive advice.\n\n\"I feel really happy for Lando. I told him he needs to stay tonight. He will try to change his flight. He's got to change his flight, he's just won a race. Such a special moment to win a race. I started at McLaren, so really happy to see them back at the top. It's been a long time,\" Hamilton remarked.\n\nThe veteran driver also reflected on his team's performance, sharing: \"A really good day. I'm happy with the set-up. We finally got that sorted.

And he squandered the chance of victory in Qatar last year.\n\nMiami was his 110th race and he struck a little fortunate in the sunshine state as he was able to pit while a safety car was deployed, meaning he was able to hold onto his lead.\n\nNorris, 24, was still tasked with fending off the dangerous Max Verstappen, who was finding difficulty controlling his car.\n\nBut Norris' victory was well deserved and will be a popular one, with the McLaren star one of the most well-liked drivers in the sport.\n\nIt is also a welcome return for his team, who last tasted victory in Monza in 2020 and presented Norris with a new deal earlier this season.\n\nNorris joined McLaren's young driver programme in February 2017 after a successful junior career, and has now reached the pinnacle of motorsport.\n\nHere we take a look inside his amazing lifestyle and his rise to the top of F1.\n\nNorris was a successful kart racer in his youth, winning three competitions alone in 2013 including CIK-FIA European Championship -- KFJ.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nHe made the move away from karting the following year and continued to impress with several first-place finishes.\n\nNorris first began to grab headlines with success in Formula 2, finishing second overall 2018 when part of Carlin.\n\nHe then joined McLaren and made his F1 debut in 2019, featuring in 21 races that year.\n\nThe Bristol-born driver achieved his first podium a year later, before making pole for the first and only time in 2021.\n\nHe is on course to record his best season to date, with the 2023 campaign his best so far after picking up 205 points to finish in sixth place overall.\n\nLike his compatriot Lewis Hamilton, Norris also lives in Monaco after moving to the French Riveira in November 2021.\n\nHe previously lived in Surrey near McLaren's base in Woking, in a home estimated to be worth \u00a316million.\n\nNorris is one of the highest earners in the paddock after penning a deal to extend his stay to 2026.\n\nThe pay rise is believed to have increased his earnings to an eye-watering \u00a320million a year, with the contract worth \u00a380m in total.\n\nOnly Verstappen, Hamilton and Charles Leclerc are paid more.\n\nAs well as fame and fortune, F1 can offer its stars opportunities to meet glamorous girlfriends, and that is exactly what Norris has been able to do.\n\nHe is rumoured to be dating Margarida Corceiro, having first been spotted with the Portuguese model and actress in public last year.\n\nHowever neither have posted photos with one another on social media with their apparent relationship taking place in private.\n\nNorris previously dated model Luisinha Oliveira between August 2021 and September 2022, but the pair were subject to abuse and death threats from trolls.\n\nNorris' father Adam, 51, is one of the wealthiest Brits with an estimated fortune of \u00a3200m.\n\nHe is a retired pensions manager and is often seen in the paddock supporting his son.\n\nHis mother Cisca is from the Flanders region of Belgium, and Norris has two younger sisters, one also named Cisca and the other Flo, as well as an older brother called Oliver.\n\nIt is no surprise a keen petrolhead has the garage to match his love for driving.\n\nNorris has plenty of cars in his collection and was gifted a \u00a3300,000 765LT Spider supercar when he signed his new McLaren contract.\n\nHe was also seen at Silverstone last year in his \u00a31million McLaren Senna, while he's understood to have a \u00a3350,000 Rolls Royce Wraith and a \u00a328,000 Fiat Jolly.\n\nHe also owns a McLaren 720S which is capable of reaching 212mph and can reach 0-60 mph in just 2.8 seconds.\n\nNorris also has a love for watches and boasts big brands like Rolex and Audemars.\n\nHe is also brand loyal and owns two Richard Mille McLaren timepieces, one of which was stolen from Norris when he attended the Euro 2020 final at Wembley in July 2021.\n\nThe \u00a3144,000 designer watch - a Richard Mille RM11-03 Automated Flyback - has been limited to just 500 pieces worldwide, so is something of a prized asset.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

The world champion was in command until the safety car boosted Norris, who has had a wild weekend here in Miami - going from sprint pole contender to eliminated in the shorter event and then having a quiet GP qualifying with the snazzily upgraded McLaren.\n\nNorris's tyre life offset seemed to make the critical difference in pulling away from Verstappen post-restart on Sunday, but his pace once released from Perez's rear much earlier hinted at what was to come, even if there was no predicting what would happen back then regarding Kevin Magnussen's latest shunt. You can never count Verstappen out, but in the end he was well beaten by a driver previously, outrageously, called overrated by some.\n\nA one-stop race in Miami doesn't sound like a humdinger on paper, but Sunday's grand prix was about as good as this track and these cars can offer us. Of course, a first-time winner in the likeable Lando Norris is a feel-good story F1 could use this year. But beyond that there was fighting throughout the field, between Oscar Piastri and Carlos Sainz, and seemingly between Lewis Hamilton and everybody else.\n\nNot only was the race interesting to follow, but the minor gaps between the top teams bode well for the rest of the year, although the track layout and hot conditions may have played some part. McLaren's upgrades seem to have allowed it to close the gap to Ferrari, which could inject some dynamism in 2024's pecking order.\n\nLando Norris is the obvious feel-good story of the day, with this maiden victory which had proven so elusive in the past through many missed opportunities. However, there never was any real battle for the win, with Verstappen comfortable at the front in the first half of the race and Norris slowly but surely edging away after he was gifted a golden opportunity by the safety car, which he did not fail to seize. Without this Magnussen-vs-Sargeant crash skewing the picture at the front, there could have been a fascinating duel with Norris potentially fast enough to bridge a 10-second gap to Verstappen.\n\nMiami was an overtaking fest compared to other races this season, and some tedious DRS moves were made up for by entertaining battles. What's more, the field seems to be bunching up - Mercedes' Hamilton finished fewer than 17 seconds off Norris in P6 - which is promising for the remainder of the season.\n\nWhat constitutes a great race? You can look at that question several ways. The quality of wheel-to-wheel battling, unpredictable action from the first minute to the last, a thrilling conclusion?\n\nTo my mind, the storylines and the degree to which it is remembered should be the defining criteria. And Lando Norris getting to celebrate his long-awaited first win means that the surprising 2024 Miami GP will ultimately live far longer in the memory than most races from the ground-effect era, even though it owed a significant amount to the timing of the safety car.\n\nEven though the result was arguably not in question once Norris had seen off Verstappen's attack at the restart to quickly pull clear of DRS range, seeing a new winner take the laurels of his former team-mates and rivals alike was a reminder that F1 can and does produce magic moments.\n\nThrough the pack too there were plenty of entertaining squabbles, with Turns 11 and 17 producing regular spikes of action. Even the cumbersome Turn 14-15 chicane was a source of drama, when Max Verstappen's snap of oversteer sent him on a collision course with a bollard that brought out a virtual safety car. And while DRS is frequently criticised for making passing too easy, I got the impression the balance was just about right this time around as defending cars could deploy their energy strategically to stay ahead as long as their tyres would let them.\n\nMiami may not be the first circuit on people's minds when it comes to producing a great race, but that is precisely what we got on Sunday - for any number of the reasons that you could wish to give.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_reduction_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag reduction system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(cars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ground effect (cars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understeer_and_oversteer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Understeer and oversteer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn-7.motorsport.com/images/amp/6l9XXj40/s6/lando-norris-mclaren-mcl38-max-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The appreciation shown towards the 24-year-old continued in the post-race interviews from a number of the grid's biggest names and existing race winners.\n\n\"I'm really happy for Lando,\" said seven-time champion Hamilton, the record holder for F1 race wins, to Sky Sports F1.\n\n\"Such a special moment to win your first Grand Prix.\n\n\"I started at McLaren and I'm really happy to see them back at the top. It's been a long time.\"\n\nVerstappen, who surprisingly had no answer to Norris' speed in the 24 laps to the finish after the restart, is a friend of the McLaren driver's away from the track and was pleased to see him break into the F1 winner's circle.\n\n\"If I get beaten, it's great that it has been done by Lando,\" admitted Verstappen.\n\n\"He deserves it. It's been a long time coming and it's going to be the first of many.\n\n\"Maybe it's also a bit of relief for him that he has that win now, who knows what's going to happen next.\n\n\"But for sure they had a strong weekend. Maybe it was a little bit messy still [on Saturday] but today they were flying - and especially Lando was flying. So definitely very happy for him.\"\n\nCharles Leclerc: \"I'm really happy for Lando. As much as we all want to beat each other and to come out on top, it's always emotional to see so many emotions on one of your competitors.\n\n\"We have all grown up together. Max and myself were on the same category but you always keep an eye on the younger categories.\n\n\"I remember looking at Lando, when he we all had these same dream of being a Formula 1 driver one day.\n\n\"Then once you achieve that you want obviously want the first win. I remember my first win and it is a very, very special moment.\n\n\"I told him already he needs to enjoy it as much as possible. He definitely deserves it.\"\n\nGeorge Russell: \"Obviously happy to see Lando finally get a victory. It seemed well deserved.

It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old driver for McLaren then controlled the race to give the organization its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021. It also made him the second British driver in F1 history to be feted on the podium by \"God Save the King.\" George Russell in 2022 is the only other British driver to win outside of Queen Elizabeth's reign; Russell's victory in Brazil came two months after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWith about 10 laps to go, Norris realized the race was his to lose when his lead over Verstappen hit 5 seconds.\n\nPeople are also reading...

McLaren now has 13 wins in races in the United States -- tying a record with Ferrari -- but it was the first on American soil since Lewis Hamilton at Circuit of the Americas in 2012.\n\nNorris' final margin of victory was 7.6-seconds over Verstappen of Red Bull.\n\n\"I love you all, thank you so much!\" Norris screamed on his radio. \"We did it! We did it!\"\n\nNorris said he knew when he entered the track he'd win at Miami.\n\n\"Finally. I am so happy. I knew it. I knew it when I came in this morning,\" Norris said. \"And I nailed it.\"\n\nMcLaren has now won an F1, Formula E and IndyCar race in the past two months. Norris is the first driver since Carlos Sainz Jr. to beat Verstappen this season -- and Verstappen was eliminated from that race in Melbourne with a mechanical failure.\n\n\"You win. You lose. I think we're all a bit used to that in racing,\" Verstappen said. \"Is a bad day P2? I will take it. I am happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and there's more to come from him.\"\n\nNorris was swarmed by the McLaren crew after the race as team members lifted him and seemed to crowd surf him until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nMcLaren, before the start of the race, hosted former President Donald Trump, who chatted with F1 officials from inside the McLaren garage. When he made his way toward the starting grid, fans began chanting \"USA! USA!\" and Trump pumped his first in approval.\n\nFerrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sainz finished third and fourth and was followed by Sergio Perez of Red Bull.\n\nHamilton was sixth for Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda of Red Bull's junior team was seventh and Russell was eighth for Mercedes. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon of Alpine rounded out the top 10. Ocon did it with team investors Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in attendance.\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Logan Sargeant crashed and brought out the safety car that forced the Pompano Beach native out of his car. The 23-year-old and only American driver on the F1 grid is clinging to his seat with Williams as speculation is rampant he could be replaced before the end of his second season.\n\nIt marked Sargeant's second consecutive last-place finish at his home race.\n\nThe Sargeant crash handed control of race strategy to McLaren, who held the lead with Norris at the time of the caution. Norris had taken over the lead when Verstappen was forced to pit from the lead after hitting a chicane that knocked a cone onto the racing surface.\n\nAs Red Bull was looking for any damage to Verstappen's front wing, a race marshal entered the circuit and scooped up the cone as F1 avoided having to use the safety car for the incident. But just moments later, Kevin Magnussen made contact with Williams and it gave McLaren the chance to strategize a victory over Verstappen.\n\nFor Magnussen, it marked another bad day in a long weekend in which the Haas driver was accused of unsportsmanlike conduct for his strategy in Saturday's sprint race.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

But it's a step in the right direction, that team has done a very good job to get everything up and ready.\"\n\nNorris urged caution against drawing definitive conclusions after just a handful of sessions on one track. The McLaren charger suggested waiting for data gathered over multiple races to provide a more accurate evaluation of the MCL38's upgrade package.\n\n\"I think you can never judge it on one session and one track,\" he explained. \"You have to see it on high downforce, low downforce and everything. People are too quick to judge everything from one weekend or one day or whatever.\n\n\"I think everyone just needs to be a bit more patient with everything and see what it's like over two weekends, three weekends before you start to judge.\n\n\"We have our answers of it's working, but to know the true extent of it and how well it performs in all different areas, that's when you have to wait over three races rather than just making a conclusion in one.\"", "source": {"uri": "f1i.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "F1i.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_delaney@f1i.com", "name": "Michael Delaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lando-norris-miami-e1714930076123.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

I'm just happy, proud. It feels like it's been a long time coming, I feel like we've had many opportunities. We've been getting closer and closer.\n\n\"As much as we had some setbacks - Friday Qualifying, the Sprint, not the best Qualifying on Saturday, I stayed positive. It all just came together.

Later, on the twentieth lap, Leclerc was the first to pit from the front to change a wheel, and four laps later Verstappen followed him from the front.\n\nOn the 28th lap, Piastri and Sainz called for new tires at the same time, then the safety car came onto the track due to the accident involving Kevin Magnussen and home driver Logan Sargeant. This was very practical for Norris, who started from fifth place and was in the lead due to his competitors changing tires. When the British driver changed his wheel, McLaren waited with confidence for a safety car phase. Taking advantage of the fact that he can change tires with less time during the safety car period, Norris drove into the pit lane for fresh tires on the 30th lap and then returned to the track in first place .\n\nAt the restart, Norris retained the top position, with Verstappen racing behind him in second place and Leclerc in third place. The reigning Dutch champion didn't have much of a chance of catching up with his leading British rival as his car struggled with balance issues that made it difficult for him in the corners.\n\nWith ten laps to go, Norris' lead over Verstappen was five seconds, which increased to almost eight seconds by the end of the race, giving the British driver a well-deserved victory for the first time in his F1 career. 24-year-old Lando Norris has been on the podium fifteen times in Formula 1 without a win, which is a record.\n\nMax Verstappen (136 points) still leads the championship points race by a large margin of 35 points, ahead of Red Bull's Sergio P\u00e9rez (101 points). Behind them are the two Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc (98 points) and Carlos Sainz (85 points) in third and fourth place. Lando Norris (83 points) is still in fifth place, but with his victory he almost overtook Sainz. The next round of the World Championship will take place in Imola in two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "newsbeezer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "newsbeezer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Piastri looked very quick, was keeping Verstappen honest and inherited the lead when the Dutchman pitted. Norris was released when Perez pitted, and both McLaren drivers had pace to burn. The team pitted Piastri, Sainz covered that which put Norris into the lead - and then he got a free pit stop when the Safety Car came out. That slice of luck helped, but from there Norris drove a fault-free race to pull away from Verstappen and win handsomely for his first F1 victory. As for Piastri, he lost out on a podium thanks to the timing of the Safety Car, and then contact with Sainz meant an extra pit stop for a new front wing which ended any chance he had of points.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I finally delivered for them' - Norris pays tribute to McLaren after 'about time' debut F1 win in Miami\n\nLando Norris, 1st\n\n\"What a race. It's been a long time coming, but we've finally managed to do it. I'm so happy for the whole team, and what we've achieved together. We've had a few little setbacks across the weekend, but today we managed to put it all together. The car was great, the strategy was perfect, and I'm over the moon. I'm proud of everyone in this team today. I've always believed in them, and they've always had faith in me, and today we've really justified that. A huge thanks go to them for the hard work they've put in that made this possible.\"\n\nOscar Piastri, 13th\n\n\"A great day for the team, but a disappointing afternoon on my side. I feel like we did a lot of things right in the first half of the race but a few things didn't go our way in the second half. The car felt the best it's been all year, so I don't think my result should take away from the performance by the rest of the team. Well done to Lando and everyone at McLaren. The race was won on merit today and it's really promising for what's to come.\"\n\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n\n\"Victory today in Miami is meaningful for many reasons. First of all, for Lando and his first F1 win. I am happy from the bottom of our hearts for him. We've often said as soon as we give him winning material, he's going to win. He did it in style.\n\n\"Beyond that, it's a very important day for the team. We've been on a journey for some time, after an incredible turnaround last year. We've kept momentum, and today is another very important step and hopefully the starting point for greater success. So, I'm very happy for all the people at McLaren, I hope they enjoy this moment because I know how much work has gone into delivering these upgrades. It's not just design or just manufacturing, it's an effort across every department at the factory and from the trackside team. This goes beyond just the people at McLaren: it goes to our power unit partners at HPP and our technical and commercial partners who are vital to this success. It's teamwork in the widest possible sense.\n\n\"The car was very good this weekend - and it's worth noting Oscar was in a very strong position to be on the podium as well, as he drove a very good race.\n\n\"Lastly, my final word is for Gil de Ferran, to whom this victory is dedicated to by the whole team. Gil, this is for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "formula1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Formula 1\u00ae - The Official F1\u00ae Website"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stella_(engineer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stella (engineer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_de_Ferran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gil de Ferran"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/t_16by9South/f_auto/q_auto/v1714950057/trackside-images/2024/F1_Grand_Prix_of_Miami/2151619466.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

And I've always said that. So as much as when you put the helmet on you hate them, and you want to beat them, and you don't care who's who, I've always had respect for the people I've raced against.\n\n\"So when anyone comes up [to me], especially people who have achieved a lot, because it always means a little bit more.

They're the people who know what it takes to achieve these types of things, for the work, the time, the effort that goes into doing something like this.\"\n\nBorn in the port city of Bristol, situated between the mouth of the River Avon and River Severn, Norris is in his sixth season of racing in F1 for McLaren - with whom he shares a lengthy association. The Woking outfit signed Norris to its young driver squad at the start of 2017, ahead of his sole season in the now-defunct FIA Formula 3 European Championship.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Norris was not - he says - named after Star Wars character Lando Calrissian. Half-Belgian thanks to his mother Cisca, Norris nonetheless races under the British flag and grew up in the Somerset town of Glastonbury, known for its yearly music festival held in nearby Pilton. This allowed him to become a day-boarder at Millfield, a private school known for its contribution to sports - and where fellow racing driver Sam Bird was also educated.\n\nInitially not interested in racing, Norris started watching F1 with his father Adam - a Bristol-based businessman - and started to develop a keenness for it. After his victory in Miami, Norris paid tribute to his family for its support throughout his racing career - and to his grandmother over the team radio.\n\n\"I spoke to my mum and my dad already, which is always nice. Normally my dad comes to the races, but not today, so I'm sure he's regretting that just a little bit. My parents have been so supportive. You know, they're the ones who are with you from the start. They allowed everything to happen. They're the ones that got me into racing, supported me, and allowed me to get to Formula 1, reach my dream, and do what I've loved to do since I was a kid.\n\n\"And I'm very fortunate for everything that they've done and the position they've allowed me to be in. You think of those moments, and therefore, of course, I want to speak to my mum and dad, first of all, because you shared all those moments with them. And I just say a big thanks. And for my grandma, because she's not been so well lately. I saw her last week, and I told her that I was going to win a race. I didn't say when. I just said I was going to win a race. And I didn't think it would be coming this soon. So I'm just very happy that I was able to do it as quickly as I did.\"\n\nAlso exposed to racing through the Gran Turismo video game series, Norris had the racing bug truly sinking its teeth into him when he was taken along with his brother Ollie to watch the karting British Championships at Clay Pigeon, the karting course near Dorchester where Jenson Button first started to race.\n\n\"Me being me, I wanted to have a go!,\" Norris told the Formula 2 website in 2018. \"Soon after, I got a Bambino go-kart to drive around at home, and it started there...\"\n\nNorris picked up karting and, by 2013, he was competing on a global stage. There, he won the Junior class of the CIK-FIA European Championship - the same year Max Verstappen won the higher KF2 category - and went on to take victory in the CIK-FIA World Championship in 2014.\n\nAlongside his Karting World Championship efforts, Norris started competing in the Ginetta Juniors Championship, a series on the support package of the British Touring Car Championship. At the age of 14 Norris was now exposed to a UK TV audience and behind the wheel of a Ginetta G40 in a full circuit race for the first time. Initially, Norris was only supposed to take part in the second half of the season, but ended up competing in the full championship - where he finished third behind future GT racers Jack Mitchell and James Kellett.\n\nNorris moved to another of the BTCC's undercard events in 2015: MSA Formula - built from the ashes of the defunct British Formula Ford Championship as the FIA rolled out its Formula 4 class worldwide. This was the first time Norris drove for Carlin, and he beat Ricky Collard and Colton Herta to the title to earn a move to the Formula Renault 2.0 championship.\n\nHis campaign there was preceded by the New Zealand-based Toyota Racing Series in the spring of 2016, which Norris won convincingly over former karting rival Jehan Daruvala. Titles in Formula Renault 2.0's Eurocup and NEC championships followed, driving for Josef Kaufmann's team, prior to his reunion with Carlin for a stab at the 2017 Formula 3 European Championship.\n\nHaving marked himself as a star of the future with his sweep of championship wins, Norris was signed to the McLaren Young Driver programme, which was one of new CEO Zak Brown's first points of business after taking over at McLaren. Against stern competition from second-year driver Joel Eriksson and third-year racer Maximilian Guenther, Norris chalked up nine victories to claim another title with two races to spare - naturally winning the rookies' championship in the process.\n\nThis elevated Norris into Formula 2, which had introduced its new F2 2018 chassis. Carlin had left the series, then known as GP2, at the end of 2016 but had re-entered the championship a year later, Norris being partnered by Sergio Sette Camara at the British squad. A one-off for Campos at the end of 2017 gave Norris a taster of what to expect, and the Briton continued to deliver in the early tests to mark himself out as a championship contender. Ahead of his first full year in F2, Norris competed in the Daytona 24 Hours alongside Fernando Alonso and Philip Hanson for United Autosports - the endurance racing team owned by Brown.\n\nConsidered as one of the best seasons of F2 thanks to its depth of talent, 2018 was contested by Norris, who won the Bahrain opener, ART's George Russell, and Anglo-Thai driver Alex Albon - who converted a race-by-race deal with DAMS into a full season thanks to a strong start to the championship.\n\nDespite opening strongly in securing the feature race victory in the Bahrain season opener (his last victory in any category before his Miami GP win) Norris did not reach the top step again in 2018 and retained his position in the championship hunt through consistency - although a puncture in the rain-affected Sochi round ended his championship hopes before the field diverted to its Yas Marina finale. Russell claimed the crown when Albon was taken out in a start-line incident following a stall, a frequent feature of the 2018 F2 car owing to a series of clutch issues.\n\nRegardless, Norris impressed sufficiently in F2 and in a series of FP1 sessions for McLaren to earn a step up to F1 in 2019 - replacing Stoffel Vandoorne at the team.\n\nNorris was partnered by Carlos Sainz in 2019, the Spaniard signed to replace compatriot Fernando Alonso in the latter's first retirement from F1. The two quickly formed a firm friendship, and combined to help McLaren move back up the grid after a series of lean years with Honda powertrains and problematic cars.\n\nIn his first F1 race at Albert Park, Norris qualified eighth and finished 12th, and followed that up with his first points through finishing sixth in Bahrain. He amassed 49 points in his maiden season as McLaren made great strides forward with its MCL34, almost half of Sainz's tally that year. His second season proved more felicitous despite the impact of COVID, and he claimed a maiden podium at the Red Bull Ring opener. This time, he finished just eight points behind Sainz, ahead of the Madrid-born driver's move to Ferrari in 2021.\n\nContracted at McLaren for a third season, Norris was partnered with Daniel Ricciardo for 2021 - which was billed as his most serious test in F1 given the Australian was still highly rated at the time. However, Norris outperformed the ex-Red Bull driver and claimed all but one of the team's five podium finishes - albeit the one that would have likely stung the most. In a zany Italian Grand Prix where title adversaries Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton crashed at the chicane, Ricciardo assumed the lead - and Norris directed to play rear gunner against the chasing Valtteri Bottas. McLaren thus secured its first 1-2 finish since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nNorris had his own opportunity to win at the next race at Sochi, and took his first pole from Sainz. Although the Ferrari driver snatched the lead at the start, Norris reclaimed it on the 13th lap and managed the race well - keeping Lewis Hamilton at bay until rain started to fall. Hamilton took the opportunity to pit for intermediates while Norris, anticipating a short shower, elected to stay out. That call proved to be hubristic, and he lost a lot of time to Hamilton while struggling on the slicks - and eventually aquaplaned off the circuit to throw away a shot at victory.\n\nAlthough Norris committed his long-term future to McLaren, its first foray into the ground-effect regulations mandated for 2022 was not entirely successful and he managed just one podium finish all year - at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola. 2023 started out even more disastrously, with just 12 points scored in the opening eight races, but Norris benefitted from a vastly improved car at the Austria round to ignite a season where he claimed seven grand prix podiums. His first victory had to wait once more when Oscar Piastri won out in the Qatar sprint.\n\nThat brings us to 2024, and Norris' best career start to an F1 championship season with three podiums - including his Miami Grand Prix victory. After walking away from China with second place, Norris had the unwanted record of holding the most podiums - 15 - without a win. This record now returns to Nick Heidfeld.\n\nIn speaking to the media, Norris has often exhibited a self-deprecative and cautious approach when discussing his chances. Even after good results, it appears he is a natural pessimist - and instead draws attention to his own weaknesses rather than opting for self-aggrandisement. Speaking about this after his Miami win, Norris stated that this is a source of motivation.\n\n\"I have my times when I'm happy with what I'm able to go out and do. I'm just one of those guys that I'm not happy when I know I've not done the job I'm capable of doing,\" he said. And [this win] shows what I'm capable of doing. I think all year I've done a very good job. And I've worked hard and I've eliminated and got rid of a lot of my weaknesses.\n\n\"I'm still going to be that guy. I don't think that's going to change. That's what works for me. That's my mindset. Everyone has their own way of doing things, their own approach, their own way that they talk to themselves and think of: how can I approach today? How can I go out and do the best job? For me, it's talking down at myself and kind of putting myself down because for me that's what works and I'm fine with that.\n\n\"I don't need other people to be happy with it and for other people to agree with it. It's what's best for me, and what works best is what's made me who I am and I think that's my best way of going forward. So I'm going to have my days when the glass is full and I can be happy and I'm proud of myself. Everyone's going to have those days and everyone should have those days. But in order to make myself the best man, the best driver, I have my way of doing things and I stick to that.\"\n\nIn 2020, Norris set up Quadrant - a company that focuses on \"racing, gaming, clothing and content\" with multiple streamers, and has since received investment from YouTuber Will Lenney. Much of the company's involvement expands into Esports and the sale of clothing, but it will expand into an athlete support programme.\n\nHe has also cultivated a following through streaming on Twitch, which he has also used for charitable endeavours - raising money for COVID response funds and mental health charity Mind. He also plays golf, playing in various Pro-Am tournaments - notably the Netflix Cup held ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023.\n\nNorris has a long-term contract with McLaren, which spans until the end of the 2027 season. It is known that he has held talks with Red Bull previously on more than one occasion, but has ultimately committed to McLaren following them.\n\nMcLaren has committed to Mercedes power for the incoming powertrain regulatory overhaul in 2026, with a deal that extends to 2030.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

champion Max Verstappen for his first Formula One victory.\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for the Briton who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), having finished runner-up an agonising eight times in 110 grand prix.\n\nVerstappen had seemed well placed to claim a fifth win in six races until a midway crash allowed McLaren to cash in on a safety car period, with Norris pitting and coming out with the lead, Reuters reported.\n\nSeeking a Miami hat-trick of wins, the Dutchman filled Norris's mirrors on the restart but his Red Bull could offer no challenge as the McLaren pulled clear.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc completed the podium, coming home third ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz, who was later penalised five seconds for his involvement in a collision with McLaren's Oscar Piastri dropping the Spaniard to fifth.\n\nThe penalty moved Verstappen's Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez up one spot to fourth.\n\nPulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former U.S. president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.", "source": {"uri": "bna.bh", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646"}, "authors": [],

While here, the McLaren driver was (jokingly) told what the reason behind his not winning races was. Since then, the British driver has ironically been extremely efficient with his performances, as pointed out by F1 journalist, Nate Saunders.\n\nProviding a statistical update on X (formerly Twitter), Saunders revealed how Norris had been on the podium for 75% of the races since his 'date.' The stat is reflective of the good luck that has sided with the 24-year-old, who eventually went on to win his first-ever F1 race at the 110th time of asking.\n\nLando Norris' first podium came in Australia a day after the Chicken Shop Date episode aired on YouTube. Failing to secure a podium finish in Japan, the McLaren driver returned to the top three with a P2 finish in China. Then, in Miami, the Briton finally broke his duck to win his maiden F1 race, over five years after his debut.\n\nWhile Amelia Dimoldenberg seemingly had a role to play in Norris' win, she wasn't the only good luck charm for him. Ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, NBA star Jimmy Butler sat in a car with the Briton for a hot lap around the track.\n\nFollowing the session, the Miami Heat player predicted that the 24-year-old would soon win a race in F1. Little did anyone know that the following Sunday would be the day it happened, especially after a long string of podium finishes.\n\nWith several podiums under his belt, Lando Norris was coming under increasing fire for not winning any race. Many wanted him to convert a podium finish into a race win just to avoid entering an unfortunate list of records. By winning the race in Miami, Norris has taken himself off the list of drivers with the most race starts without a win.\n\nNico Hulkenberg is on top of the list with 208 races. Meanwhile, former world champion Jenson Button also ranks higher than Lando Norris, as he had to wait for 113 races for a win.\n\nAhead of the race in Miami, Sky Sports F1 even aired a video on YouTube where the #4 McLaren driver took a lie detector test. While here, Norris predicted his future as he claimed he was confident of winning a race in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_gopal_srivastava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Naman Gopal Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Dimoldenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amelia Dimoldenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_F1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports F1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H\u00fclkenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico H\u00fclkenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenson_Button", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenson Button"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/def6ff3a-lando-norris-smiling.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I was a lot more confident yesterday than I was today so, yeah, just some things to review.\n\n\"But obviously a better qualifying, it's close.

Her website adds that she upholds a pledge to advocate for her clients with the same fervor as she would for her own \"family.\"\n\nNorris holds a Juris Doctor degree from DePaul University College of Law, where she held esteemed roles such as Student Bar Association Supreme Court Justice and Black Law Student Association Mock Trial Team Member. Before establishing her firm, she served as a law clerk for the City of Chicago's Public Defender Office 711. The talented attorney worked as a judicial extern to the Honorable Judge Victoria A.

Red Bull's three-time world champion was powerless to stop Norris, who drove superbly in an upgraded McLaren.\n\nTeam boss Stella was confident that their car would be able to give Red Bull a run for their money but didn't realise just how good the outcome would be. Speaking to Sky Sports, the Italian engineer admitted: \"We knew that the car was quick, [although] it's a bit of a surprise. But we take it positively and we take it for the future as well.\"\n\nStella went on to say: \"The most important is the first victory for Lando because he deserved it so much. We always said that as soon as we give him the right material, he is going to make it, and he made it. For me, my thoughts are with the men and women at McLaren.\"\n\nThe McLaren principal dedicated Norris' breath-taking win to ex-sporting director Gil de Ferran, who died aged 56 in December while racing with his son.\n\nThat was echoed by team CEO Zak Brown, who also paid tribute to Mansour Ojjeh, the former McLaren part-owner who passed away at the age of 68 in 2021. \"This is long overdue, and this is a very popular win amongst the fans and the drivers,\" Brown remarked.\n\n\"The drivers went up to him to congratulate him. He drove perfectly. The car was really fast and I think Gil de Ferran and Mansour had something to do with today.\n\n\"Building up these Formula 1 teams doesn't happen overnight, a huge contribution from 1,000-plus people back at McLaren, so I want to thank all the men and women that have worked so hard. Coming out of where we were at the start of last year to where we are now is just amazing and it has just been teamwork.\"\n\nYour turn! How many more races will Lando Norris win this season? Join the debate in the comments section\n\nMcLaren are set to introduce another set of upgrades for the next Grand Prix in Imola\n\nMcLaren say that they'll have more upgrades when F1 returns in two weeks' time for the iconic Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Revelling in his long-awaited victory, an ecstatic Norris beamed: \"I don't know what I'm going to say, honestly.\n\n\"A lot of smiling, a lot of cheers... A lot of hard work goes into a day like today, but just happiness, me smiling - which is not always the case - but yeah, I dream of these days sometimes and you never know when they're going to come towards you, but today was that day.\"\n\nThe British driver, who's now competed in 110 F1 races and finished on the podium 16 times, added: \"I would like to say it's the start and now we're already hungry for more. But yeah, we'll keep our heads down. We'll keep pushing.

To get that first victory is always incredible. I've of course had my moments where I've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win,\" he said.\n\n\"But I wasn't worried.

Still, the McLaren driver has not won a race in F1. Despite this statistic, Norris feels one needs to have patience in Formula 1 for winning. However, he revealed lately that he is not good at being patient, which is something he has had to change.\n\nIn a video with ESPN, the Briton said, \"I have to be patient. It's not something I'm good at. Something I had to learn. I think you have to learn it when you come to Formula 1.\"\n\nNorris highlighted how even the best drivers in F1 may not get the opportunity to win. The simple reasoning behind it is - the lack of a good enough car.\n\nThe 24-year-old has faced a similar ordeal with McLaren, as the Woking team has struggled to provide a race-winning car to Norris. The #4 driver highlighted how he has got podiums with several P2 and P3 finishes.\n\nYet, the top step of the podium still eludes him. However, it is not that Norris has never been in a position to win a Grand Prix or a sprint race.\n\nIt is his lack of patience and tendency to make mistakes at crucial moments, which has cost him the victory. The 2021 Russian GP is the perfect example of the same.\n\nNorris led the race at the Sochi Autodrom and looked set to take his maiden F1 win. However, when the heavens opened up in the closing laps of the Grand Prix, the British driver ignored his team's suggestion to pit for intermediate tires.\n\nEventually, Norris slid off the wet track and eventually pitted to later only finish P8 at the chequered flag. Since then, the 24-year-old has been waiting for another chance to win a race and has made mistakes to be in contention for a win.\n\nThe 2023 Qatar GP was a splendid one for McLaren as they finished as the second-best team behind Max Verstappen and Red Bull. Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were in supreme form throughout that weekend in Lusail.\n\nHowever, Norris made a crucial mistake on the last corner of the track during sprint qualifying. This wide moment gave the advantage to his teammate, Piastri, who took pole position ahead of him for the sprint race.\n\nIn the sprint race, the Australian driver held on to his lead, while Norris slipped back behind Max Verstappen to finish third. Had the #4 driver shown some patience to nail the final corner and get the pole, he could have got his first F1 race win, albeit it was a sprint.\n\nRegardless, the lack of race-winning capable machinery from McLaren has been the biggest limitation for Norris. Still, the Woking team is developing quite well since its mid-season upgrades in 2023. If they continue on this trajectory, the Briton would hope to break his duck of wins this season.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aishwary_gaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Aishwary Gaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi_Autodrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sochi Autodrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lusail"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/4c24c7da-lando-norris-china-surprised.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Lando Norris says the online trolling never really bothered him as he went winless through his first five Formula 1 seasons, even when it got worse as one of the breakout stars for fans introduced to the sport through Netflix.\n\nIt was a long wait as Team McLaren got its program together and prepared cars capable of competing with Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. Norris passed the time doom scrolling social media, searching for motivation from his haters.\n\nHis moment came Sunday in his 110th career start when he earned his first victory by beating three-time reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen at the Miami Grand Prix. Verstappen had won the first two races at Miami and Saturday's sprint race before he hit a cone early Sunday to give Norris his opportunity.\n\n\"I never didn\u00b4t believe in what I could go out and do, so I am happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong,\" Norris said. \"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I freaking love it. It makes me smile more than anything, especially \"Lando No-Wins.\" That\u00b4s become the thing.\n\n\"For me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn\u00b4t think I could go out and do it, it\u00b4s put an even bigger smile on my face. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nHe turned up at the post-race news conference in a champagne-drenched firesuit. Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton led the congratulatory hugs for Norris, and Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc sprayed champagne directly into Norris' face on the podium.\n\nMcLaren pit crew members celebrate after McLaren driver Lando Norris, of Britain, won the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nHe had closed his eyes and turned his smiling face to the sky as \"God Save the King\" was played, and he cradled the winning trophy as if it was an infant. He crowd-surfed with his McLaren crew and when he saw boss Zak Brown headed his way, warned 'Don\u00b4t break my ribs,' in anticipation of the bearhug.\n\n\"I\u00b4m shivering like hell because I wanted to keep all my champagne on me,\" Norris laughed, \"and now I\u00b4m freaking cold.\"\n\nMcLaren needed this win, its first since 2022 (Daniel Ricciardo, and it came on a weekend in which the team introduced massive upgrades it was certain would make its cars more competitive. The 24-year-old Norris said he arrived Sunday believing he'd win.\n\nNorris had promised his ailing grandmother last week that a victory was on the horizon but allowed \"I didn\u00b4t think it would be coming this soon.\"\n\nMcLaren this year now has scored wins in F1, Formula E and IndyCar, where Pato O'Ward last week was declared the winner of the season-opening race because Josef Newgarden was disqualified.\n\nThe next three IndyCar weekends are spent at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the buildup to the May 26 Indianapolis 500. McLaren has to be feeling some pressure after a winless 2023 season and somewhat disastrous Indy 500.\n\nThe McLaren organization is intertwined - the IndyCar drivers were on social media celebrating Norris as soon as he crossed the finish line - and the F1 victory is a boost at the perfect time of the season. McLaren is also going to Indy with NASCAR superstar Kyle Larson, who will become the fifth driver in history to attempt to complete 1,100 miles of racing in one day in the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nThe hype surrounding Larson's attempt at \"The Double\" has helped McLaren return to its status as one of the most recognizable brands in motorsports.\n\nIt is all vindication for Brown, an American who started his motorsports career in a marketing role in Indianapolis and now runs one of the largest racing brands on the planet.\n\nBrown likes to stir the pot and ensure drama remains at the front of almost every race weekend, and he was at it again in Miami when he took a shot at Red Bull by implying famed car designer Adrian Newey was leaving the team because of the fallout from an investigation into improper conduct by team principal Christian Horner.\n\nBrown went so far as to say Newey was probably just the first to head for the exit door, an assumption he was making based on \"all the resumes\" flying around the paddock.\n\nHe doesn't let up in IndyCar, either, and rival team owner Chip Ganassi and Brown are not friendly. Brown signed Ganassi driver Alex Palou for 2023 and the two teams used a mediator to battle over the two-time IndyCar champion. It was decided Palou would join McLaren in 2024, but Palou balked last August and is now being sued by McLaren for more than $30 million.\n\nMcLaren last week fired David Malukas before he even made an IndyCar start for the team over injuries he suffered in a mountain bike crash ahead of the season, angering Malukas' millennial fanbase. That followed the unpopular team dismissals of James Hinchcliffe and Oliver Askew, both done after McLaren entered the series with controlling interest of an existing team.\n\nBrown unapologetically chases free agents with little regard to how many seats he actually has open. That's partly how this Palou mess began - when Palou looked at the F1 landscape, he realized Norris wasn't going anywhere and McLaren would likely never have a seat for him in the series.\n\nIf he was going to stay in IndyCar, then Palou figured he'd stay with the team that helped him to two championships rather than move to winless, revolving-door McLaren. While the decision might ultimately have been the right one for Palou, Brown is digging McLaren out of a decade-long slump and the Norris win has the entire organization feeling unbeatable.\n\nAP F1: https://apnews.com/hub/formula-one\n\nMcLaren driver Lando Norris, of Britain, on monitor, is sprayed with champagne as he stands on the podium after winning the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race at the Miami International Autodrome, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla.

He had a 12-second lead when the safety car was called after a collision between home-hero Logan Sargeant and Keven Magnussen.\n\nThe safety car slowed the rest of the field down and allowed to make his pitstop and keep the lead. Despite having Max Verstappen behind him, Norris drove calmly to claim his maiden F1 race win by more than seven seconds.\n\nThe win came with former US president Donald Trump watching on from the McLaren garage.\n\nVerstappen and Norris are close friends off the track. Verstappen pulled up alongside Norris to congratulate him on the cool-down lap back to the pits.\n\nHis Aussie teammate Oscar Piastri was on for a stunning result himself, but finished well out of the points after a collision with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz.\n\nStarting sixth, Piastri was in third by the end of the first lap. He was running fourth after the safety car restart when Sainz clipped his front wing in a clumsy move at the hairpin at the end of the straight.\n\nThe wing was damaged, and Piastri was forced to pit for a new one. That collision will be investigated by stewards after the race.\n\nHe and countryman Daniel Ricciardo were involved in a thrilling battle for 16th place in the closing laps. They eventually finished line-astern in 15th and 16th.\n\nRicciardo's race was also compromised by the timing of the safety car.\n\nStarting last, the RB team started him on the hardest of the three tyre compounds, which would have given him a tyre advantage over his rivals at the end of the race. But the safety car meant everyone around him got a cheap stop, which nullified any advantage.", "source": {"uri": "wwos.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "wwos.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gV7Ww_1mbN2_QIVWCcr4GE7hSqo=/0x306:3282x2153/0x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F8baef93f-49ff-459e-a23a-c3c68ea093cd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I think definitely it wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyse it all and we'll try to come back stronger.\"\n\nVerstappen still retains a strong lead in the driver standings, with the Dutchman 33 points ahead of his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez, while Norris' win has seen him move up to fourth place behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

His compatriot Lewis Hamilton hailed this as a monumental occasion and urged Norris to party by staying back in Florida.\n\nF1 drivers rarely get time to unwind during the season and in two weeks, the sport travels to Imola for which most will start preparing from now onwards. Norris, originally scheduled to fly out of Miami on Sunday night, has likely changed his plans, thanks to Hamilton's intervention.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the race, the Mercedes driver said, \"I honestly feel so happy for Lando. I just told him, he needs to stay tonight.\"\n\nAfter 110 attempts, Norris finally stood on the top step of the podium, and the seven-time World Champion (who has 103 F1 race wins) insists that he needs to celebrate this. \"He's gonna try and change his flight. He's got to.\"\n\nHamilton is no stranger to success but he realizes how special it is to win one's first Grand Prix, especially for someone like Norris who came agonizingly close on a handful of occasions in the past.\n\nHamilton, of course, won his first race with McLaren in 2007, as did Norris last Sunday. This made Hamilton reflect on his past, and share his happiness about seeing the Woking-based outfit back on top.\n\nHamilton started his career at McLaren and won his first World Championship with the British outfit in 2008. However, after witnessing a decline, he shifted to Brackley to represent Mercedes, who helped him win six more Championships.\n\nNow on the cusp of leaving Mercedes for Ferrari, Hamilton is happy to see his former team back on top.\n\nMcLaren last won a race in 2021, thanks to Daniel Ricciardo's heroics in Monza. Almost three years later, they win once again, this time with Norris. \"Obviously I started at McLaren,\" said Hamilton. \"So, really happy to see them back at the top. It's been a long time.\"\n\nFor Hamilton, the Miami GP was not as glittering, as he could only muster up a P6 finish. McLaren's upgrades helped bolster the car's performance and Norris used that to his advantage on his way to securing a win.\n\nHamilton will be hoping for similar levels of progress from Mercedes in the months to come, as he looks to finish off his Silver Arrows stint on a high.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "somin_bhattacharjee@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Somin Bhattacharjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Arrows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver Arrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monza", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brackley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brackley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/a0a9c692-f1-2024-05-06t085133.468.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Former McLaren mechanic, Marc Priestley also joined in to shower praise on the 24-year-old's determination and grit. The 47-year-old uploaded a video on LinkedIn where he spoke about the years' worth of work that has gone on behind the curtains to make the win a possibility.\n\nCalling it 'The Lando Norris Story,' Priestley detailed how it was a lesson of not losing belief. The McLaren setup underwent a rebuilding phase, with many people having to make various sacrifices. However, the belief within the Woking-based team kept them pushing.\n\n\"If you wanna take some lesson away from the Lando Norris story, take the lesson that belief will drive results.\", Priestley said.\n\nAside from praising his past employers' much-awaited win, Priestley also joined in on the celebrations. The Briton donned a papaya-colored watch, paying homage to the winners of the 2024 Miami Grand Prix.\n\nSince 2019, Lando Norris has been a full-time driver with McLaren, having debuted on the grid alongside Carlos Sainz. The British driver never doubted his team and continued to stick with the team even when things went from bad to worse. And now, the 24-year-old is reaping the rewards of his loyalty, winning his first-ever race in F1, which also benefited Priestley monetarily.\n\nStarting the race in P5, Lando Norris wouldn't have entertained many thoughts of winning the race in Miami. Presumably, while he would have set his sights on a podium finish, Priestley had his hopes much higher.\n\nAs revealed on X by the man himself, Priestley had placed a bet on Norris to win the race. The 47-year-old further revealed the odds of the bet were 18/1 and expressed how happy he was to have won. Although the odds didn't favor Norris, his performance in the race warranted nothing but a race win.\n\nIn the middle stages of the race, Norris had dropped a place and was running sixth. However, the Safety Car made its way to the track following an incident between Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant. McLaren and Norris took full advantage of the same to take the lead.\n\nWhile others pitted under normal racing conditions, Norris did the same under the Safety Car. From there on, the #4 driver showcased brilliant composure to defend his position and do away with the ghosts of the 2021 Russian GP to pick up the winner's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_gopal_srivastava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Naman Gopal Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/551b608a-priestley-norris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Prix", "body": "McLaren's Lando Norris capitalised on a bit of good fortune to win the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, holding off Red Bull's triple world champion Max Verstappen for his first Formula One victory.\n\nIt was a long overdue triumph for the Briton who held the record for most podiums without a win (15), having finished runner-up an agonising eight times in 110 grand prix.\n\nVerstappen had seemed well placed to claim a fifth win in six races until a midway crash allowed McLaren to cash in on a safety car period, with Norris pitting and coming out with the lead.\n\nSeeking a Miami hat-trick of wins, the Dutchman filled Norris's mirrors on the restart but his Red Bull could offer no challenge as the McLaren pulled clear.\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc completed the podium, coming home third ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz, who was later penalised five seconds for his involvement in a collision with McLaren's Oscar Piastri dropping the Spaniard to fifth.\n\nThe penalty moved Verstappen's Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez up one spot to fourth.\n\nIn a season dominated by Red Bull it was a hugely popular win by the 24-year-old Norris.\n\nPulling into the pit lane, he was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome that included former US president Donald Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race.\n\nUntil Sunday it had been another dominant weekend for Red Bull as Verstappen topped the timesheets in the only practice session and sprint qualifying on Friday and then won the sprint race and took pole on Saturday.\n\nHis second place in the grand prix had little impact on the drivers' standings as he continues to hold a commanding 35-point lead over Perez.\n\nMercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth and RB's Yuki Tsunoda seventh followed by George Russell in the other Mercedes.\n\nAston Martin's double world champion Fernando

Y'all get out my way!\n\nIn a pre-race interview, Butler explained why he's such a fan of Norris.\n\n\"That's who I aspire to be,\" Butler said. \"He's great, he's young, he's a little bit attractive, and so, I think it's good to be him right now.\"\n\nFor Norris, it was his first F1 victory. He interrupted the dominance of Max Verstappen.\n\n\"I'm just really proud,\" Norris said. \"A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team.

This did not.\n\nIt seems - at least on circuits like Miami - McLaren's new upgrade package has made it Red Bull's closest challenger when that looked like a feat only Ferrari could achieve mere races ago.\n\nDare we even consider if this McLaren team and Norris and Piastri can be a rival for Verstappen far more often? McLaren's more even driver line-up must be a worry for Red Bull at least for the constructors' championship right now if the team can maintain this type of form through the year.\n\nOnce again, when other teams have struggled in this area, McLaren has proven it can bring huge upgrade packages and make them work. It's another blow to Mercedes who look set to be battered by its own customer if this form can be maintained.\n\nBack to McLaren though, and with the 30-year anniversary of Ayrton Senna's passing and the shock loss of Gil de Ferran earlier this year, it feels fitting that the team is back to winning ways and can dedicate the victory to them. - Jack Benyon\n\nLoser: Red Bull\n\nIt's been a rollercoaster weekend for Red Bull and it unravelled quickly in the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nFirst Max Verstappen struggled to make his customary enormous early gap at the head of the field and the fact that Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc set race fastest laps at a critical early stage of the race hinted that Verstappen didn't have his usual prodigious pace.\n\nThe late safety car that gave Lando Norris a pitstop was just the nail in the coffin as opposed to the deciding factor, and the team will no doubt be worried after McLaren has turned poor form here last year into an impressive race win.\n\nMere millimetres made the difference between this race being 10x worse as Perez's \"torpedo\" as Carlos Sainz called it at Turn 1 almost ended in disaster. He struggled for pace also and was fortunate to a) not to lose out to Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes in the closing stages, something unthinkable earlier in the weekend, and b) take back fourth from a penalised Sainz.\n\nWork to do for Imola and beyond. The season might not be over yet. - JB\n\nWinner: Lando Norris\n\nThere was a big sense of 'I've silenced my critics' amid Norris's reaction to his first F1 win.\n\nThat was best encapsulated by: \"I go on Instagram and like all the comments of people abusing me, I freaking love it. 'Lando no wins' has become the thing. For me to prove those people wrong has put an even bigger smile on my face today.\"\n\nNorris has always taken it in his stride but it will be no doubt nice for him to finally put to bed the three years of 'when will you win a race' that the Sochi 2021 near-miss created.\n\nIt's also the greatest vindication of his commitment to McLaren so far and a proper window into why Norris is so invested in McLaren.\n\nYes, the safety car timing helped, but it was a big win for McLaren's new upgrade and it arguably hints that further victory opportunities for Norris are just around the corner. - Josh Suttill\n\nLoser: Daniel Ricciardo\n\nThe second half of the Miami GP weekend offered little more than a sobering reality check following Ricciardo's outstanding - but brief - return to form with fourth place in the sprint.\n\nHe seemed unfazed by his Q1 exit and didn't think it was due to \"something we f***ed up\", instead suggesting there was something wrong with his set of tyres - even though he conceded \"it's kind of a s***ty thing to say, because there is no facts behind it\".\n\nBut if the level of competitiveness RB has enjoyed this weekend offered some hope for the last-place starter, that quickly evaporated in the race. Ricciardo was only ever mired in the midfield in the grand prix proper and never looked like escaping that.\n\nOK, he got off the mark for 2024 in the sprint, but once again when the big points were on offer it was Tsunoda doing the heavy lifting. Time's ticking before that becomes the natural trend, rather than coincidence. - Jack Cozens\n\nWinner: Esteban Ocon\n\nWe've already coined Ocon the biggest winner from F1 2024's worst team and Miami was yet further proof of that.\n\nHe was behind team-mate Pierre Gasly in qualifying (for the first time in a 2024 grand prix) and behind him early in the race, but he burst past him on the virtual safety car restart and the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg.\n\nThat set Ocon up nicely for a 10th place finish and while he lost out to Fernando Alonso, Oscar Piastri's misfortune cancelled that out and left Ocon to secure Alpine's first point of an otherwise miserable 2024 season.\n\nIt was a worthy point and both a mark of marginal Alpine progress since Bahrain and Ocon's stellar start to the year - something that won't go unnoticed as the pieces of F1's 2025 silly season continue to fall into place. - JS\n\nLoser: Oscar Piastri\n\nWhat could have been a victory challenge or some sort of 1-2 or 1-3 for McLaren ended with 13th for Oscar Piastri.\n\nHe kept Verstappen within three seconds for the opening stint and that in itself was impressive, after he'd opportunistically risen from sixth to third on the opening lap and then passed Charles Leclerc to make that second.\n\nPitting just before the safety car put Piastri in a fight for fourth with Sainz and the pair clashed on two occasions, once with the stewards not taking action as Piastri defended robustly at Turn 11 despite Sainz's annoyance, and again which resulted in front wing damage after which he pitted.\n\nA case of what could have been and good points dropped in a very aggressive battle with Sainz. Without the full McLaren upgrade, a fifth would have been an adequate result but instead Piastri can only imagine what was possible. - JB\n\nWinner: Yuki Tsunoda\n\nNot for the first time this season, Tsunoda was the class of the midfield.\n\nNabbing a point in the sprint - assisted by Kevin Magnussen's antics and a Lewis Hamilton penalty - was a good save following a below-par sprint qualifying, and the weekend only took off from there.\n\nUnlike Hulkenberg, whose race seemed to be undone by a reactionary early pitstop, Tsunoda and RB bided their time and were rewarded for extending the opening stint when the safety car presented the opportunity for a cheap pitstop to run seventh.\n\nKeeping the Mercedes at bay was never a realistic expectation - yet while Lewis Hamilton sure enough came by, Tsunoda didn't even need to defend from George Russell; he had enough in his arsenal to pull away in the closing stages.\n\nIt was yet another accomplished drive that's hoisted him into the top 10 in the championship when an RB driver has no real business being there. - Jack Cozens\n\nIt's hard to argue with Magnussen's assessment of his Sunday (and weekend on the whole).\n\nWherever you stand on his actions in the sprint, the penalties he earned there were the result of deliberate actions with a clear goal in mind (to help Hulkenberg earn points). The one he earned in the grand prix proper was simply the result of a misjudged move that had race-ending consequences for Logan Sargeant.\n\nThe move was entirely unnecessary and the penalty entirely justified - and puts him on the brink of a race ban, a situation that should've been wholly avoidable. - JC\n\nWinner: F1 and Miami\n\nThe first two Miami Grands Prix weren't exactly classics and it left the event in a weird middle ground between the great racing Austin produces and the great show (and racing) Vegas's debut mostly offered.\n\nBut the 2024 Miami GP weekend was stellar from start to finish. The McLaren and Norris factor is significant given the race itself was wall-to-wall great action, but it did provide a tense race and the layout meant most of the battles in both the sprint and grand prix were far from foregone conclusions.\n\nNot every overtake was decided before the braking zone and (usually via Kevin Magnussen) there were some lovely elongated battles to enjoy throughout the order.\n\nThat's a much-needed boost for Miami as it tries to stamp its authority as more than just the unnecessary third-American race.\n\nSo too for F1, after most of the headlines generated in 2024 have been for off-track matters, this was a wonderful on-track story with a fantastically visibly emotive story.\n\nWild 2025 silly season developments are fascinating but nothing compares to a proper pure sporting moment like this. - JS\n\nLoser: Nico Hulkenberg\n\nA great qualifying and first 10 laps of the race (where he was dicing with the Mercedes for the minor points-paying positions) ultimately came undone when an early stop married with the VSC and safety car timing handed the advantage to his rivals.\n\nHaas did pit Hulkenberg under the safety car for a second set of mediums but Ocon had enough to keep Hulkenberg away from the final point on a day where it felt like there was at least one there for the taking on home soil.\n\nThis was a drive far more reminiscent of its 2023 backsliding than some of its strong points-earning 2024 drives thus far. - JS\n\nLoser: Lance Stroll\n\nMagnussen's second indiscretion in two days spared some of Stroll's blushes as a 10-second penalty for passing Albon off-track dropped him to 17th in the classification.\n\nStroll gets a bit of leniency for being among the midfielders considering the safety car allowed some of those he'd been ahead of in the first stint a cheap pitstop. And it's not like the Aston Martin was mustard in Miami either.\n\nBut even with that in mind it looked fast enough that he should have been slicing through those cars with far more ease.\n\nThat's now two points finishes from six races (eight including the sprints) - team-mate Fernando Alonso has a 100% record, extended in Miami by a safety car-assisted climb up the order from 15th on the grid. Stroll's even been overtaken by Tsunoda in the drivers' championship.", "source": {"uri": "the-race.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Race"}, "authors": [{"uri": "race_team@the-race.com",

However, a dodgy strategy call in the rain saw him lose a potential win, leaving him and the team heartbroken.\n\nThat missed opportunity, which Norris felt was unfairly criticized by some, fueled the skepticism surrounding his ability to handle the pressure of leading races.\n\n\"People like to continue to use that, even after China last weekend when I made a mistake in Turn 1 on Lewis [Hamilton],\" he said.\n\n\"Anyone can say what they want. People don't need to like me. They don't need to support me.\n\n\"But when people doubt me in certain situations, you want to go out and prove them wrong.\n\n\"They think they know what they're talking about and when you prove that they don't, then that's a nice thing to go out and do.\n\n\"It's not a dig at anyone, but it's just nice to just go out there and do my job and show people what I'm capable of.\n\n\"I wanted to say like the Valtteri line 'to whom it may concern', but I was like ' that's copyrighted', so I didn't want to repeat it!\"", "source": {"uri": "f1i.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "F1i.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phillip_van_osten@f1i.com", "name": "Phillip Van Osten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motor_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motor racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 Russian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sochi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://f1i.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lando-norris-1-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

And now he has an even more prestigious title on top: maiden Grand Prix race winner.\n\n\"About time, huh?\" he said when interviewed by former F1 champion Jenson Button in parc ferme in the paddock at Miami International Autodrome, having come so close to victory in the past only to be denied every time.\n\nHis next word was not so repeatable, the F-bomb live on international TV forcing him to make a quick apology for his coarse language before moving on with the rest of the questions from the media.\n\n\"What a race. It's been a long time coming, but finally I've managed to do it,\" he said, struggling to make himself heard above the cheers and whoops of a jubilant crowd where it seemed Lando was everybody's best friend.\n\n\"I'm so happy for my whole team that I finally delivered for them,\" he continued. \"A long day, a tough race, but I'm finally on top, so I'm over the moon.\n\n\"I knew on Friday that we had the pace,\" he insisted, telling the crowd that he had even predicted that morning that this would be the day of his first Grand Prix victory on his 110th outing, having previously amassed 15 podiums.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with his MCL38 fully pimped out with McLaren's latest upgrade package, while team mate Oscar Piastri will have to wait until Imola in two weeks to get the same benefit.\n\nThe car had been strong in practice but ill-timed oversteer cost him a shot at pole in qualifying for the Sprint race from which he was bumped off track on the opening lap. He fared better in GP qualifying and took P5 for today's race.\n\nEven so this didn't look like being a particularly auspicious place from which to earn his first F1 win. However a long first stint meant he had just inherited the lead when a safety car was scrambled for Logan Sargeant's accident.\n\nThe timing proved perfect for him and he took the restart ahead of Max Verstappen. It seemed inevitable the Red Bull would cruise back into the lead - he has done in almost every recent race - but this time that didn't happen.\n\nInstead, Norris started punching in a series of fastest laps that saw him pull away from the field by around half a second every lap. And at the end of each one, the cheers from the fans in the grandstand got louder and louder.\n\nIn the end it wasn't even close and he had a 7.5s lead over Verstappen at the chequered flag, although it took a few minutes for realisation of what he'd just achieved to settle in and for him to calm down enough to speak.\n\n\"The whole weekend has been good, I've just had some little setbacks along the way,\" he said in reference to the Sprint retirement. \"Just a couple of mistakes here and there.\n\n\"Today we managed to put it together. We put the perfect strategy, it all paid off, so thanks to McLaren and everyone. And I have to give a shout out to my mum and dad, of course!\n\n\"I'm just proud, really. I mean, a lot of people I guess, doubted me along the way,\" he continued, thanking McLaren for always having faith in him and recently giving him a long erm contract extension despite a lack of wins.\n\n\"I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them, and I did believe in them, and today proved exactly that,\" he said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today, we put it all together.\n\n\"This is all for the team,\" he added.\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella was one of the first to congratulate Norris on his success after the race. \"Most important is the victory for Lando because he deserves it so much.\n\n\"We have always said, as soon as we give him the right material, he will make it and he made it,\" he said. \"It's so deserved for the McLaren team.

And so I could be happy for him,\" said Hamilton to the media. \"I really hope that he's able to appreciate the moment and enjoy.\n\n\"Because it's a big one.\"\n\nEven the driver Norris held off, Max Verstappen, sang the McLaren driver's praises.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando, it's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today,\" said Verstappen following the Miami Grand Prix.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f2obtlR5VEs1dCKA1Wk3JKystAk=/0x244:6192x3340/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25434768/2151622439.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

I think what we did was correct but it shows there wasn't much difference.\"\n\nNorris was unable to remain on the Medium for his last shot in the pole position shootout as he had no new sets of the yellow-walled compound available to be used.\n\nHowever, the Briton suspects that he \"would have done the same time\" regardless and assessed that there were positives and negatives to the respective compounds.\n\n\"I mean they handle some places better and worse for each other, but I feel like I would have done the same time on a Medium if I had a second Medium,\" he repeated.\n\n\"But you do have to drive them a little bit differently and where they're good and bad is a little bit different.\n\n\"So exploiting those areas is like I knew now what the Soft is really good at.\n\n\"So then you can exploit the Softs and find another new set of Mediums, I think I could have exploited that more.\"\n\nMax Verstappen bagged pole but claimed that his Red Bull car did not \"feel nice to drive\" amid his own complaints about how the tyres have performed this weekend.\n\nAsked whether it was differing between runs, Norris said the fragile nature of the tyre had meant it was tough to push to the extreme without overstepping the mark.\n\n\"I think it is,\" he answered. \"I think there's a small difference of whatever makes a big difference. The tyres are the same.\n\n\"You push two kph more into a corner, even one kph, it can be the difference of you being on the limit and over the limit. So then you get the feeling it's different run to run.\n\n\"Brake five metres later, two metres later, you might be on the limit and go, oh, that was fine, I feel like I can push more. You brake two metres later and you go, oh, now I'm over the limit.\"\n\nNorris suspects that the hot conditions present and the track surface at the Miami International Autodrome have contributed to the problems the drivers have faced.\n\n\"I think just because it's hot,\" he highlighted. \"Yeah, it's a bit even trickier. Yeah, maybe the tarmac as well plays a part.\n\n\"But I think everyone's in the same boat. Everyone's inconsistent and up and down.\n\n\"So every now and then one person putting in the mega lap just because it clicks and they just drive a little bit under the limit and it's perfect.\n\n\"But no, there's nothing wrong with the tyres. It's just... I'm sure Max knows it.

(It proved to be a big weekend overall for McLaren: Bianca Bustamante also had her first podium finish of the season in the F1 Academy race on Sunday.)\n\nAs he crossed the finish line, the TV picked up his audio: Norris let out two huge screams, and then a laugh (which, in Norris' nature, is more of a giggle-the internet kind of goes crazy for his slightly goofy and highly likable persona). And then: \"I love you all. I love you all. Thank you so much. I knew it. I knew it when I came into this moment.\"\n\nNorris and I actually chatted a few days before the race -- about what was working going into the landmark weekend, his state of mind in 2024, his sense of style, and his not-so-secret passion for photography.\n\nVogue: Hey Lando -- thanks for this, I know you're busy on race week -- there's so much going on in Miami right now.\n\nLandonNorris: All good! Yeah, it's been fun -- I've been playing padel at a place called Reserve.\n\nLove that place -- by the Miami Design District, right?\n\nYeah, exactly. I try to play padel wherever I am. I play back home in Monaco, or in the UK when I can. Some of the other drivers take it more seriously, but I like to just do it with my friends.\n\nWhere's your head at right now, both with Miami and with the season so far?\n\nHonestly, there aren't too many things that are different. I think we're in quite a settled place, in a good way -- everyone [on the team] is working together in a better way than ever before. We've got our heads down, too. There's a lot of noise coming from other teams and places, but you know, me and Oscar [Piastri, the other McLaren driver], we're really focusing on what we need to focus on -- and 2024 has been strong. We're consistently there, even on tracks we didn't expect to be quite as quick on. Really, there are no negatives at the moment -- we're just putting in good, consistent performances.

It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last. He deserves it today.\"\n\n\"I'm just really happy for Lando. As much as we all want to beat each other and to come out on top, it's always emotional to see so many emotions in one of your competitors.\n\n\"We have all grown up together. I remember looking at Lando when he was in KF3, and we all had this same dream of being a Formula One driver someday.\"\n\n\"I think Lando has been deserving of a win for many, many years now. He's been driving at an exceptional level and to finally get it.\n\n\"I'm obviously happy for him and frustrated because we were ahead of him before that pit stop before the Safety Car. If we would have extended one more lap, we would have pitted under the Safety Car and we would have won the race. But I think luck comes to the guys who deserve it and Lando is was one of those guys that deserved a little bit of luck this weekend.\n\n\"Lando, he's been driving like a race winner for many, many races in a row now. He just deserves the win. Luck or not luck, doesn't matter. He's a race winner and it's about time.\"\n\n\"I'm really happy for Lando. Such a special moment to win your first Grand Prix. I obviously started at McLaren and I'm really happy to see them back at the top. It's been a long time.\"\n\n\"He's deserving of a race victory probably many, many years ago. And I think for all the drivers in Formula 1 in this era of dominance from one team and one driver, it's always great to see somebody get that chance to score a victory.\"\n\n\"Well done to Lando. First win after so many podiums. I'm really happy for him. Hopefully he [remembers] this day - the first of many wins.\"\n\n\"Very happy for [Norris] and for the whole team, and I think we deserve it. Our trajectory in the last 12 months has been towards this moment.\"\n\n\"Very happy for him. Genuinely proud to see him get his first win. When you are teammates with someone you have a bit more of a closer connection with them. Saw his talent and ability and knew it was a matter of time. Although nothing is guaranteed in this sport, it kind of felt like it was going to happen sooner or later.

Oracle Red Bull Racing team-mate Sergio P\u00e9rez also struggled with the balance of the RB20 and finished in fifth place, allowing Verstappen to extend his lead at the top of the Drivers' Standings over the Mexican to 35 points.", "source": {"uri": "outlookindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.outlookindia.com/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/outlookindia/2024-05/73f52c7a-1206-4129-b992-b28ad9c81d20/F1_Grand_Prix_of_Miami_2.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Lando Norris says the online trolling never really bothered him as he went winless through his first five Formula 1 seasons, even when it got worse as one of the breakout stars for fans introduced to the sport through Netflix.\n\nIt was a long wait as Team McLaren got its program together and prepared cars capable of competing with Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. Norris passed the time doom scrolling social media, searching for motivation from his haters.\n\nHis moment came Sunday in his 110th career start when he earned his first victory by beating three-time reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen at the Miami Grand Prix. Verstappen had won the first two races at Miami and Saturday's sprint race before he hit a cone early Sunday to give Norris his opportunity.\n\n\"I never didn't believe in what I could go out and do, so I am happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong,\" Norris said. \"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I freaking love it. It makes me smile more than anything, especially \"Lando No-Wins.\" That's become the thing.\n\n\"For me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nHe turned up at the post-race news conference in a champagne-drenched firesuit. Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton led the congratulatory hugs for Norris, and Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc sprayed champagne directly into Norris' face on the podium.\n\nHe had closed his eyes and turned his smiling face to the sky as \"God Save the King\" was played, and he cradled the winning trophy as if it was an infant. He crowd-surfed with his McLaren crew and when he saw boss Zak Brown headed his way, warned 'Don't break my ribs,' in anticipation of the bearhug.\n\n\"I'm shivering like hell because I wanted to keep all my champagne on me,\" Norris laughed, \"and now I'm freaking cold.\"\n\nMcLAREN'S WIN\n\nMcLaren needed this win, its first since 2022 (Daniel Ricciardo, and it came on a weekend in which the team introduced massive upgrades it was certain would make its cars more competitive. The 24-year-old Norris said he arrived Sunday believing he'd win.\n\nNorris had promised his ailing grandmother last week that a victory was on the horizon but allowed \"I didn't think it would be coming this soon.\"\n\nMcLaren this year now has scored wins in F1, Formula E and IndyCar, where Pato O'Ward last week was declared the winner of the season-opening race because Josef Newgarden was disqualified.\n\nThe next three IndyCar weekends are spent at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the buildup to the May 26 Indianapolis 500. McLaren has to be feeling some pressure after a winless 2023 season and somewhat disastrous Indy 500.\n\nMONTH OF MAY\n\nThe McLaren organization is intertwined -- the IndyCar drivers were on social media celebrating Norris as soon as he crossed the finish line -- and the F1 victory is a boost at the perfect time of the season. McLaren is also going to Indy with NASCAR superstar Kyle Larson, who will become the fifth driver in history to attempt to complete 1,100 miles of racing in one day in the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nThe hype surrounding Larson's attempt at \"The Double\" has helped McLaren return to its status as one of the most recognizable brands in motorsports.\n\nIt is all vindication for Brown, an American who started his motorsports career in a marketing role in Indianapolis and now runs one of the largest racing brands on the planet.\n\nBrown likes to stir the pot and ensure drama remains at the front of almost every race weekend, and he was at it again in Miami when he took a shot at Red Bull by implying famed car designer Adrian Newey was leaving the team because of the fallout from an investigation into improper conduct by team principal Christian Horner.\n\nBrown went so far as to say Newey was probably just the first to head for the exit door, an assumption he was making based on \"all the resumes\" flying around the paddock.\n\nHe doesn't let up in IndyCar, either, and rival team owner Chip Ganassi and Brown are not friendly. Brown signed Ganassi driver Alex Palou for 2023 and the two teams used a mediator to battle over the two-time IndyCar champion. It was decided Palou would join McLaren in 2024, but Palou balked last August and is now being sued by McLaren for more than $30 million.\n\nMcLaren last week fired David Malukas before he even made an IndyCar start for the team over injuries he suffered in a mountain bike crash ahead of the season, angering Malukas' millennial fanbase. That followed the unpopular team dismissals of James Hinchcliffe and Oliver Askew, both done after McLaren entered the series with controlling interest of an existing team.\n\nBrown unapologetically chases free agents with little regard to how many seats he actually has open. That's partly how this Palou mess began -- when Palou looked at the F1 landscape, he realized Norris wasn't going anywhere and McLaren would likely never have a seat for him in the series.\n\nIf he was going to stay in IndyCar, then Palou figured he'd stay with the team that helped him to two championships rather than move to winless, revolving-door McLaren. While the decision might ultimately have been the right one for Palou, Brown is digging McLaren out of a decade-long slump and the Norris win has the entire organization feeling unbeatable.",

So we felt the responsibility and I have said that many times, that it is up to us, it is not up to Lando.\n\n\"But credit to Lando, he kept developing over the winter, especially looking at improving in qualifying and delivering laps that sometimes don't have to be 100% when you have a fast car, just be there. I think he is doing that.\"\n\nThe Italian added: \"That's for me a testament to how ready he was, and also if we look at what he delivered in podiums with a car that sometimes wasn't really a podium finisher on merit, for me Lando is in a very strong journey.\"\n\nStella praised Norris for keeping his powder dry in the first stint on medium tyres when stuck in traffic, only to then deliver one fastest lap after the other once he found clear air, pace that even had Red Bull's Max Verstappen rightly worried.\n\n\"I have to say that his race management is very mature,\" said Stella. \"As soon as he saw there wasn't much to do after the first lap, he started to save his tyres because he knew his race would come at some stage.\n\n\"The pace he was able to pull off when the cars ahead of him pitted, that was quite incredible. He was getting the most out of the material he has.\n\n\"We needed to provide him with winning material.

The McLaren driver admitted the festivity might leave him more \"scratched up\" than his recent minor injury which he sustained ahead of the race.\n\nThe British-Belgian driver earned his first Formula 1 victory at the Miami Grand Prix, crossing the finish line a commendable seven seconds ahead of defending champion Max Verstappen. Amidst the heat and the roar at the Miami circuit, it was the deployment of a safety car that initially offered Norris the prime opportunity to seize control of the race. From that point, the McLaren driver showed no signs of relenting, effectively maintaining his lead and showcasing the capability of both car and driver on this demanding track.\n\nAs the paddock began to wind down, Norris's intentions for a rather enthusiastic celebration began to take shape. He explained during the post-race Drivers' Press Conference, as quoted by GP Blog:\n\n\"I was meant to fly but Zak [Brown] just told me we fly tomorrow so I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way. I might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow, so I don't care, but I'll enjoy my time. This only happens once when you're taking your first win. It's nice to do it here in Miami.\"\n\nHeading into the Miami race weekend Norris had made headlines after sustaining a facial injury during Amsterdam's Koningsdag celebrations, seen in social media images sporting bandages, which is what the Miami Grand Prix winner is poking fun at. The incident, reportedly involving broken glass, caused a significant cut to his face, but luckily it was nothing too serious.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the race, Norris commented on the injury, as quoted by The Mirror:\n\n\"It was just cut on glass, it was just a bit of broken glass, a little bit silly.\n\n\"It looks a lot worse than it is, everyone thought it was horrendous, but it's just a little cut. I wish it was a cooler story, but sadly it is not. Someone took a picture, and it blew up into something much bigger than what it needed to be or should have been. Nothing to be ashamed of.\"\n\nCountering Norris's anticipation for the night, pro tips came flying in from more seasoned members of the F1 paddock. Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton suggested Norris \"to stay an extra night rather than fly home immediately.\" Meanwhile, Max Verstappen, adding to the light-hearted camaraderie, mentioned, \"Miami provides a better night out than Silverstone.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lydia_mee@newsweek.com", "name": "Lydia Mee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388343/lando-norris.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=355759e676882fa36ff5bf15ec150619", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

It was a brilliant result for the 24-year-old who took the checkered flag ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc's Ferrari. After starting fifth on the grid, Norris benefitted from a mid-race Safety Car to jump into the lead of the race and comfortably pulled away from the field over the last two dozen laps.\n\n\"What a race! It's been a long time coming but we've finally managed to do it and deliver for the McLaren team,\" said the race winner. \"I knew on Friday we had the pace and today we put together the perfect strategy and it paid off. This is for my team, I'm proud that we've put it all together. I'm finally on top and over the moon!\"\n\nIn front of a sell-out crowd, the whole McLaren team wildly celebrated with the British driver after the flag and the popular racer was congratulated by a number of his fellow competitors for his maiden victory in F1. At the start, Max Verstappen led away from pole and was hotly pursued by Leclerc, the second McLaren of Oscar Piastri and Carlos Sainz's Ferrari. The latter pair enjoyed a race-long duel, but Piastri's race was effectively over when Sainz overtook the McLaren at Turn 17 on lap 39 damaging the front-wing of the McLaren as he did so -- and forcing Piastri to pit for repairs.\n\nIt wasn't entirely trouble free for Verstappen out front and on lap 21 he made a small mistake at the tight Turn 14 chicane and dislodged the bollard onto the race track. A brief Virtual Safety Car was then deployed to allow the marshals to remove the broken cone. While Verstappen and Leclerc pitted during this phase of the race, Norris ran longer and eventually inherited the lead. Then came the turning point in the race. On lap 29 the full Safety Car was deployed as Haas' Kevin Magnussen had made contact with Logan Sargeant at Turn 3. The Fort Lauderdale man was sent spinning into the barriers and was the race's only retirement.\n\nNorris seized the opportunity to pit behind the Safety Car and with the field at a reduced pace he emerged back in the lead ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. When racing resumed on lap 33, Norris defended from Verstappen at Turn 1 and with tyres that were six laps fresher, was quickly able to build a gap and commandingly went on to pull away over the remaining 24 laps. Sainz finished fourth ahead of Red Bull's Sergio Perez, who narrowly fended off a charging Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Lando Norris on his first Formula 1 victory, as well as Zak Brown and the entire McLaren team on an incredible day in Miami,\" said Tom Garfinkel, Managing Partner FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX, who presented Norris the winners' trophy on the podium. \"We are thrilled that the Miami Grand Prix played host to such an exciting race and delighted that the 275,000 fans in attendance this weekend were able to enjoy three days of exciting on-track action, as well as the lineup of great entertainment throughout the weekend. Thanks to Formula 1 and the FIA, we're proud to have showcased the city of Miami to the world and there's no doubt our third race in Miami Gardens has been our best yet.\".\n\nA sell-out crowd attended the Miami International Autodrome over the three days, up over 5,000 from last year and an increase of 45,000 from the inaugural event in 2022. It was once again a popular destination for famous figures from the sporting world and celebrities from the film and music industry. Miami Dolphins players Jalen Ramsey, Raheem Mostert, Bradley Chubb, Jaelan Phillips, Teron Armstead and Jevon Holland joined the Miami Heat's Jimmy Butler, along with fellow NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Tennis champions Serena and Venus Williams rubbed shoulders with singer-songwriters Zayn Malik, Shakira, Camila Cabello and electronic duo The Chainsmokers. Meanwhile the celebrity investors of the Alpine -- NFL players Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce along with golfer Rory McIlroy -- were also at today's race supporting their team.\n\nAside from the main event, there was plenty of entertainment for fans to enjoy across the Campus, from the performances of DJs Cedric Gervais, John Summit and Kaskade at Hard Rock Beach Club to the post-race podium set from renowned DJ and producer Kaytranada.

Sporting a bandage on his nose from a recent wild celebration and having been penalized 25,000 euros for darting across the track following a sprint race incident in Miami, Lando Norris nonetheless clinched his first Formula 1 victory on Sunday.\n\nThe 24-year-old's win was partly due to the opportune arrival of the safety car, with La Gazzetta dello Sport criticizing the FIA for its decision, claiming it \"got it wrong\" and contravened its own protocols regarding the safety car's placement within the field of cars.\n\nMax Verstappen, however, brushed off speculative scenarios with a light-hearted comment, \"If my mum had balls, she would be my dad.\"\n\nDespite suspicions from Red Bull team principal Christian Horner that Verstappen might have sustained damage from colliding with a bollard, the three-time world champion was skeptical of that explanation for the end of his winning streak.\n\n\"When I heard what Lando's laptimes were, I knew it was going to be a difficult day,\" he remarked.\n\nMeanwhile, Norris benefited from the latest upgrades to his car, with McLaren CEO Zak Brown detailing that Norris was driving the 'B version' of McLaren's 2024 model.\n\n\"We have made a huge step forward,\" Brown stated, adding that Oscar Piastri will get the full package next time out in Imola.\n\nVerstappen acknowledged the performance of the McLaren, saying, \"The McLaren was incredible today. They had an upgrade that obviously worked. But if a bad day is P2, I take it, right?\"\n\nCharles Leclerc, who finished third, hoped for rapid improvements from Ferrari: \"Hopefully we can bring the upgrades very quickly and catch up.\"\n\nFerrari's team leader Frederic Vasseur confirmed that new components are anticipated for the upcoming race at Imola, predicting, \"We're taking them (Red Bull) out of their comfort zone more and more often,\" and adding, \"And then a safety car is enough for McLaren to win. That was different last year, when anything could happen and Red Bull would still win.\"\n\nRed Bull also plans to introduce car upgrades at Imola in two weeks.\n\n\"We have a bit of work to do from our side,\" Verstappen conceded. \"It definitely wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyze it all and try to come back stronger from it.\"\n\nID:543008:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect3252:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gmm_f1@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Gmm F1", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9d\u00e9ration_Internationale_de_l'Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gazzetta_dello_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Gazzetta dello Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zak Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/16/max-verstappen_1.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Rumored to be dating Magui Corceiro for months, Norris decided to address the truth in a lie detector test with Sky Sports.\n\nWith all the wires hooked up, Norris was ready to face questions from Simon Lazenby, who asked him if he had a girlfriend. Norris replied, \"No\" and the detector revealed that he was telling the truth.\n\nLazenby followed up by asking if he has \"many girlfriends\" to which the McLaren driver said yes, and the lie detector confirmed the same. The host scoffed, and remarked, \"Formula 1 drivers\" jokingly suggesting that the stars competing in the pinnacle of motorsports often have multiple partners.\n\nThe test revealed that Norris was telling the truth, but there aren't any reports of the 24-year-old dating multiple women at the moment. Cordeiro, meanwhile, has been on Norris-related news quite often.\n\nIn April, Norris was seen driving down the streets of Monaco in a convertible and Corriero was in the passenger's seat, fueling their dating rumors further. The next day, they went on a double date with Norris' sister and brother-in-law to a local casino.\n\nOriginally a model, Magui Corceiro is Portuguese soccer star Joao Felix's ex-girlfriend. Rumors of her dating Norris emerged just months after the latter publicly broke up with Luisinha Oliveira.\n\nDespite their break-up in 2022, Norris continues to have a special place in Oliveira's heart. Appearing in an interview for a Portuguese channel, Oliveira revealed that Norris is still her favorite F1 driver.\n\nOliveira was the one who made her relationship with Norris official on social media. The post garnered a lot of attention, and she even accompanied him to several F1 outings.\n\nThings turned sour soon, unfortunately, and Norris saw it fit to announce their break-up on social media. He deleted the post very quickly, but not before fans took screenshots of the same and circulated it all over.\n\nFollowing this, Oliveira focused on her studies, opting to pursue a Master's Degree from Rome Business School.

Like to get that first victory is always incredible.\n\n\"I've of course had my moments where we've been close and I've never been able to convert it into it, into the win.\n\n\"But I wasn't worried, like as much as a lot of people doubted that I was gonna be able to put it together and win a race. I wasn't worried.\n\n\"I've kind of been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes and the team have got what it takes. And I was patient with it.\n\n\"I said it this morning, like it's not often that I'm optimistic about things. But actually all weekend there's been something, you know, like already practice, quali.\n\n\"We've been close and we were very good on Friday and there was kind of that spark and we maybe lost it a little bit into Saturday.\n\n\"But today definitely came back and turned into a little fire. So yeah, it was an incredible race.\"\n\nNorris admitted that his optimism that he could challenge was blunted at the start but reignited when he could see still polesitter Max Verstappen leading up ahead.\n\nThe McLaren driver stated that he was mindful to avoid a repeat of his Turn 1 exit from the Sprint when he saw Perez diving late on the brakes at the opening corner.\n\n\"It [that belief] was put out very quickly, but I mean, I had to, I kind of had a little flashback to yesterday's Sprint race, when I saw Sergio on the inside,\" he said.\n\n\"Just thought, let's try make it around Turn 1 for once, so I took it easy I knew like we had good pace and I knew I was in it for the long game.\n\n\"I was behind Checo the whole of the first stint, but my pace at the end of the first in was the best on track and I can still see Max.\n\n\"And when you can see Max, there's hope. And it's not often that you can see Max on track.\n\n\"So I knew the whole time, even when I was back in sixth, that there could have been opportunities, whether there was one Safety Car or something went my way.\n\n\"I was very quick at the end of the first stint, I kept my head down, we kept pushing, everyone boxed from ahead of me and I could just use all the pace that I had, which was a lot of it.\n\n\"And being able to go so long on the tyres, being able to have the pace I had, turned into that bit of luck, I'll happily admit, sometimes you've got to have a bit of luck on your side and things have got to go your way and I had that today, but I'll take it happily.\n\n\"After the Safety Car I could kind of just get my head down and push on and I was confident I could take it from there.\"", "source": {"uri": "motorsportweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.motorsportweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MiamiGP-Norris-9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

The McLaren driver started the race on the third row but what followed was brilliant race management by Norris, which helped him keep the tires alive when everyone else pitted.\n\nWhat was surprising for many was that even in older medium tires, Norris was quicker than the Red Bull and Ferrari of Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc on fresh hard tires.\n\nThen came the safety car, which gave Lando Norris a massive advantage and the lead in the race. In the end, the McLaren was just too fast, and Norris was untouchable. The young driver banked his first career win at the F1 Miami GP in what was just the second loss for Red Bull this season.\n\nAfter the second sprint weekend of the year, what did we learn? Let's take a look.\n\n2024 F1 Miami GP: Key Takeaways\n\n#1 The battle at the front could get very interesting\n\nThree different teams have won this season. There is, however, one interesting part. Red Bull brought a substantial upgrade to the car in Japan, and McLaren brought its major upgrade in Miami.\n\nDespite all of this, Ferrari was quite competitive against both of them at the F1 Miami GP, even though the team has yet to bring an upgrade. Ferrari brings a major upgrade to Imola, that upgrade could be the one that closes the last few tenths to the front of the grid.\n\nLooking at the pattern and how the season has panned out, single-team dominance might not be the reality, as we could see a legitimate fight at the front of the grid.\n\n#2 Red Bull has no clue about what to do with the second seat\n\nThe sprint saw Daniel Ricciardo pull off a blinder and finish P4. That was a blistering performance that brought back memories of the old Ricciardo. What was surprising was what happened next.\n\nRicciardo's F1 Miami GP weekend was turned upside down with a poor qualifying session that saw him eliminated in Q1 and hence have a poor race.\n\nYuki Tsunoda, on his part, had a brilliant race and deserves all the plaudits for Sunday, his Saturday, however, was underwhelming. Sergio Perez on the senior team was being harassed by Lewis Hamilton, who was driving a much slower car.\n\nAll in all, Red Bull came out of the F1 Miami GP scratching its head over who should team up with Max Verstappen next season.\n\n#3 Mercedes is in a bigger hole than it would have realized\n\nMercedes had upgrades on the car at the F1 Miami GP, but if you look at how it fared on-track, it would be a hard sell to actually make that claim. The German team saw George Russell finish behind Yuki Tsunoda in the race, and it was because the car didn't have the pace.\n\nAt some point, the team has to accept reality and just put the head down and start working, the shortcut to the front doesn't exist, and Toto Wolff would be wise to just focus on the car from now on.\n\n#4 Kevin Magnussen needs to be reined in\n\nKevin Magnussen was investigated for unsportsmanlike conduct during the F1 Miami GP. The Danish driver did seemingly lose the plot completely during the sprint and even ended up making a mistake in the race as he crashed into Logan Sargeant.\n\nAt 10 penalty points, Kevin is just two short of being banned from racing, something that he clearly won't be happy about if it happens.\n\n#5 Alpine is making stronger progress than expected\n\nAlpine scored its first point this season, and arguably it was the result of some driver magic and some improvement in the pace of the car. The development should be applauded because, considering where it was in Bahrain, this is a significant jump.\n\nThe F1 Miami GP showed that the team is making progress at a much faster rate than it would have imagined.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charanjot_singh_kohli@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Charanjot Singh Kohli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toto Wolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location_and_Tracking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location and Tracking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/f9bc8-17149988133504-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

That the victory could not have happened to a nicer bloke has been the rudimentary but accurate assessment.\n\nAfter the McLaren driver's superb win in Florida, his first of 110 race starts, he believes he has comprehensively proved wrong those who had questioned his ability and will to face down the world champion Max Verstappen. It was a straight fight in which the Dutchman was beaten comfortably into second.\n\nNorris's journey to F1 might easily have been derailed. As a child he followed Rossi in MotoGP and his mum, Cisca, and his dad, Adam, believed it was a phase he was going through, but indulged him with a quad bike as a present for his fifth birthday.\n\n\"They gave me a little red plastic quad bike and that's one of the earliest memories of my life,' he told me when we spoke about his life and career for my book F1 Racing Confidential. \"I loved it but within a few months they sold it because it was too dangerous. Mum and Dad didn't like seeing me go round corners on two wheels. They didn't tell me, I just came back from school one day and it was gone. There were a lot of tears for several days, because I really loved that bike.\"\n\nWhen the tears had dried, Norris kept up the pressure on his parents and they let him have a 50cc motorbike to ride round the garden. A trip to the Clay Pigeon kart track in Dorset followed and the six-year-old was captivated.\n\nHe took to karting with a passion and the memories remain vivid today, such as the time another driver's father donated a race suit.\n\n\"It was one of those moments when you get something when you are young and you never want to let go of it,\" he said. \"I slept in it even though it was smelly and old. The boots were way, way too big but I would wear it all day at home, it was awesome. We still have it, my dad kept it as it was my first-ever race suit.\"\n\nThese years were also instructive of just how determined Norris was. He has taken flak about his ability and competitiveness on social media but even as a kid there was no shortage of grit on display.\n\nHe admitted he was smaller and lighter as a youngster, bullied on track in the British kart championship, but when he grew and had a competitive kart the wins began coming. At 13 he decided it was not only something he enjoyed but that he really could pursue. This time Mum and Dad backed him.\n\nAfter karting, success in F4 was followed by Formula Renault and F3. McLaren spotted him early and in 2017 took him on as a junior and simulator driver when he was 16. Then, only a year later, he took part in his first F1 free practice session in Spa and in the back of his Carlin F2 team truck at Monza, in 2018, Norris signed the deal that would put him in F1 in 2019.\n\nIt had been a remarkably rapid rise and some questioned McLaren's commitment to him. Yet Norris has more than delivered. He has developed from rookie to team leader, a confident, experienced driver, helping the team move forward and unafraid to go wheel to wheel with the best in the sport. Lewis Hamilton has acknowledged him as a fair and fearsome competitor and while that debut win remained elusive Norris was unbowed.\n\nDuring his time as a reserve driver he would join the mechanics and help strip down the car after races, building friendships and relationships that endure to this day. Before the victory in Miami his No 2 mechanic, Frazer Burchell, said he felt you could never rule out Norris having a shot at something special. How right he was.\n\nBurchell is the man who holds the front jack on Norris's car when it enters the pits - a ballsy job that requires immense trust between mechanic and driver - and also straps him into the car before the off. Few are better placed to pass judgment on F1's latest winner.\n\n\"I have known him since he was a junior driver at McLaren,\" Burchell said. \"Lando was 19 when he first signed as a reserve, so he would come to race weekends as an unknown and would come out for dinner with us when we went out in the evenings. He is unique as quite often if his flight is the same night as us, he will come into the garage and help strip the car.\n\n\"He will chat with us and chill out, he won't sit in his driver's room or go back to the hotel, he will happily come into the garage and be with us instead. So we all see him as a friend as well as a driver.\"\n\nWhich is no little compliment and a huge endorsement of a driver who has the potential to be world champion. Burchell was front and centre when Norris threw himself into the arms of his crew after climbing from his car in Miami. A moment understandably celebrated with enormous pleasure by everyone at McLaren.\n\nThey had not won since Monza in 2021 in what has been over a decade of struggle, Miami Dolphinss Hard Rock stadium may yet take some time to be scoured of the scent of champagne from their celebrations.\n\nThe party lasted long into the night but this is likely only the beginning. The first win is always the hardest and now Norris has put that to bed, more will surely follow.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

But it is his best Grand Prix result of a difficult season to date and he felt much more comfortable in his Mercedes than has been the case in recent weeks.\n\nAfter a close fight with Nico Hulkenberg in the opening stages and an ultimately unsuccessful chase of Sergio Perez later on, Hamilton was pleased with his afternoon's work. He said: \"So much fun. I've really enjoyed this weekend race-wise. It's been a lot of fun on track.\n\n\"[I've had] really great, tough, close battles. I mean, going out to Turn 11, up against the wall, wheels locked - I was like, 'Oh jeez, this could be either a big crash into this corner or I'm going by'. So I love that I had that, in zero fear in that moment, so I'm super grateful for that.\n\n\"Then, to be able to hold on to a Red Bull, was really quite cool - great job by my team.\" He was also beaming about Lando Norris' victory and expressed his pride in both his fellow Briton and his old McLaren team for their success.\n\nNorris became the 21st British drive to win a world championship F1 race by beating Max Verstappen to the chequered flag in Florida. Number 20 on the list is Russell, whose first and so far only victory came in Brazil in 2022.\n\n\"He's deserving of a race victory probably many, many years ago,\" Russell said of his friend Norris. \"And I think for all the drivers in Formula 1 in this era of dominance from one team and one driver, it's always great to see somebody get that chance to score a victory.\"\n\nGeorge Russell wasn't happy with his day\n\nBut while he was happy for Norris, Russell didn't have much positive to say about his own result after finishing eighth. He said glumly: \"It was a pretty rubbish race from start to finish, in all honesty. I had a good start but when Checo [Perez] sent it down the inside, when he rejoined everybody had to check up a bit and it cost me three positions.\n\n\"Then I just had no pace at all there on in, so I need to check the car, check the data because something didn't feel quite right. It's definitely felt like a more difficult weekend than all of the others, but the results have all really been relatively similar.\n\n\"We are between P5 on a good day and P8 on a bad day, and today was a bad day, we finished P8. Lewis had a good day, drove really well and finished P6. It's kind of where we are.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

I'm always for that.\n\n\"People don't need to like me.

Is he retiring? Has Fred Vasseur created a Ferrari Dream Team?\n\nWe only know the answer to the first question today. Newey stepping away from Red Bull after nearly two decades is a landscape-altering move akin to Lewis Hamilton leaving Mercedes.\n\nThere are many possibilities for his future, with Aston Martin and Williams joining Ferrari as potential destinations.\n\nEven if it's a move into retirement, Red Bull is a weaker outfit without his aerodynamic genius, and his decision will gravely hurt them, no matter how much they will publicly downplay his role.\n\nThat's a sizeable bonus for all other teams in an era where generating underfloor downforce is the prerequisite for competitive performance, something Red Bull has enjoyed since 2022, thanks to Newey's aerodynamic genius.\n\nEven if they continue to have an advantage once he departs in 2025, it's the end of the domination levels that have caused Grands Prix to become a foregone conclusion in recent years.\n\nREAD MORE: FIA announce HEAVY fine for F1 star after 'extremely dangerous' move\n\nAs the Newey exit announcement became official, another rumour rang through the paddock, and Williams was again in the thick of the discussions.\n\nAn FIA request to allow a super licence to the under-18 Andrea Kimi Antonelli suggested Joe Saward's post-China intel had some basis.\n\nJames Vowles, Williams' Team Principal, dampened any talk that Logan Sargeant would be out of the team in Imola, as initially suggested, but Antonelli is in his thoughts.\n\nWhile other teams, including Mercedes, Antonelli's Junior Team backers, denied they asked the FIA to bend the rules, Williams had Vowles swerving the question in the press conference.\n\nWhether you believe Antonelli is the second coming of Jesus, any mid-season driver swap is uncommon, and ones outside Red Bull's ecosystem are rare moments worthy of attention.\n\nAfter seeing Oliver Bearman, Antonelli's F2 teammate, adapt so well to F1 machinery, the possibility of another young hopeful getting their chance to shine is an enticing prospect.\n\nShould it pan out, it might be a harsh - perhaps premature - ending for Sargeant's F1 career, but there's no denying that it's always incredibly exciting to have new names racing at the top.\n\nWith Bearman and Antonelli's junior titles, either or both stepping up will see the grid continuing to strengthen and move away from weaker pay drivers, something fans have wanted for years.\n\nREAD MORE: Hamilton hit with SEVERE FIA penalty after clumsy Miami race\n\nAll this off-track action continued 2024's being a season where announcements beat racing in for entertainment.\n\nHaving Newey and Sargeant's futures to discuss must've felt like gifts for all commentators, especially considering the last Miami GP was rather dull when it became clear Verstappen would fight through the pack with relative ease.\n\nHowever, random trivia and commentary booth debates weren't necessary in either of Miami's races, as the 20 drivers put on a show that might even help on-site fans forget the eye-watering prices they paid to watch the race.\n\nAnother two-pronged Haas approach in Sprint brought the American team points after Kevin Magnussen's penalty-attracting driving kept wheel-to-wheel action going through nearly all 19 laps.\n\nPierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon's all-Alpine Lap 1 fight suggested that the Grand Prix would have more of the same battling, too, and indeed, it did.\n\nFerrari and McLaren kept pace with the Red Bulls while all remaining cars duked it out for whatever points they could in some top-tier elbows-out racing.\n\nHaving Norris lead the race after the Safety Car had almost everyone watching feel some hope that he could finally take a well-earned first victory, but also knowing Verstappen behind would most likely ease by within two laps of the restart.\n\nBut then he didn't. And Norris began extending his advantage. The impossible turned into reality. After two seasons of single-driver dominance, hopes of actual competition prevailed.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether this is the start of a revolution that sees multiple drivers and teams fighting for victory, but we can hope. And remember where hope got us on Sunday...", "source": {"uri": "gpfans.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GPfans"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_kimberley@gpfans.com", "name": "Jim Kimberley", "type":

'But then I moved to quad biking. I was a big fan. Then I really got into motorcross.'\n\nNorris - who admitted being more interested in MotoGP motorcycle racing than F1 growing up - said: 'The racing is quite boring, sometimes. It's hard to see how it pulls in fans. The races compared to other categories are sometimes a lot worse, they should always be better.\n\n'I don't really know how to fix it; maybe have a load of power and no downforce, but I'm sure they will have a way.

I don't know if he's going to come to more races now,' Norris joked.\n\n'But there's a lot of special, cool people that have been here this weekend. Donald is someone that you've got to have a lot of respect for in many ways and for anyone like that who acknowledge what you can go out and do, and the work ethic that goes into things, you've got to be thankful for that.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarida_Corceiro",

We did the perfect strategy and it all paid off.\"\n\n\"I'm just proud. A lot of people doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years in my short career but today we put it altogether.\n\n\"This is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and do believe in them. Today we proved exactly that.\"\n\n\"You win, you lose. I think we're all used to that in racing, right? Today was just a bit tricky. I think already on the mediums, it didn't feel fantastic. We were pulling away but not like it should be and once we made the pit stop and I heard the lap times the McLarens were doing, I was like, 'wow, that's pretty quick.\n\n\"Once they switched onto the hard tyre, they just had more pace, and especially Lando, he was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us on that stint, but if a bad day is P2, I take it.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming and it's not going to be his last one, so he definitely deserves it today.\n\n\"I mean understeer, oversteer, just very low grip on four wheels, and that's something that we have to understand.\n\n\"They came with an upgrade. For sure it looks like it works, right? So we have a bit of work to do from our side. I think definitely it wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyse it all and we'll try to come back stronger from it.\"\n\n\"It was very tricky at the start. Checo was on my inside. I didn't get a very good start, as soon as I left, I had wheelspin.\n\n\"I saw Checo on the right but there was very little grip, so he locked up.\n\n\"I thought we would all crash but unfortunately for everybody we all got out of the first corner.\n\n\"Then it was all about trying to focus on ourselves. But today, again, we were missing a little bit of pace.\n\n\"We did our best but the timing of the Safety Car wasn't great for us and we had the oldest tyres.

However, she is still keeping a keen eye on the proceedings. The 21-year-old is rumored to be dating McLaren's Lando Norris, and despite her being thousands of miles away, she is trying to monitor the Briton's progress.\n\nCorceiro is currently stationed in Lisbon, Portugal, some 4,000 miles away from the venue of the Miami GP. From her friend's Instagram activity, fans on social media were able to decipher that the model was actually watching the GP event on her phone whilst dining at a restaurant.\n\nNorris and Corceiro have been rumored to be in a relationship ever since last year. The 21-year-old was previously in a relationship with Barcelona's Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. However, they broke up in early 2023. Since then, she's been spotted with the McLaren driver on various occasions.\n\nThe links and reports leading to Norris and Corceiro's relationship had died down after a while. But these hints have raged up once again after the 24-year-old racing driver was seen regularly with her at different locations during this season.\n\nVery recently, Lando Norris was spotted by fans basking in the sunlight of Monaco. He was out for a drive and the fans noticed that Magui Corceiro was actually in the passenger's seat. That's not all, however. It would appear that the two families have also been acquainted with each other over this romance.\n\nRight after being spotted enjoying a Sunday drive in Monaco, the duo were again spotted together at a casino in the Principality.

We want them,\" Norris is accused of screaming at police before pushing past barricades and joining the advancing mob.\n\nAccording to a statement of facts, Norris was arrested on May 3 after an FBI agent interviewed him at his job. It is unclear if he has retained an attorney as of Monday.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Norris arrived on Capitol grounds around 12:45 p.m. on Jan. 6 and from that point onward, he was seen in video footage pushing past metal bike rack barriers as he chanted and yelled at police lined up to defend the Capitol building.\n\n\"We got bad news, let us drain that swamp. All we ask if you walk away. Let us bring it. Let us bring,\" he is accused of saying. \"I got bad news. We're pushing through. You better get down with us or back off because we're pushing through.\"\n\nOther footage allegedly shows Norris telling people around him to exercise discretion as he urged: \"Get ready to storm the Capitol!\"\n\n\"Hey discretion. Discretion is the word. Discretion. We're going to let it play out,\" he said.\n\nIt was clear to prosecutors based on other remarks he made that he understood why Congress was meeting that day and he could be heard making references to objections to electoral certificates.\n\nWhatever \"discretion\" he hoped to apply, police and prosecutors said that went out the window as Norris continued on to breach multiple barricades. Even after one line was briefly reestablished, prosecutors say Norris managed to get himself back behind the barricades again where he repeatedly yelled at police that \"we don't want you guys.\"\n\nHe also urged the crowd to \"make a stand, while there is still time to make a stand.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to be peaceful and selfish? Think about the kids and future children. Make a stand. Make a stand for your country,\" he allegedly yelled over his bullhorn.\n\nNorris is also accused of being one of the first rioters to ascend stairs on the Capitol's east side. It was here that a group of police were lined up and Norris screamed to them: \"Send those motherf -- -- out to talk to us,\" referencing lawmakers inside. The line at the steps on the east side wasn't held for long and officers had to retreat while Norris and others allegedly surrounded them and chanted \"Push forward!\"\n\nWhen chemical irritants were deployed by police, Norris fell back to the rear of the crowd.\n\nThe FBI said as part of its investigation into Norris, prior to his arrest on Friday, investigators obtained a search warrant to pore through his Facebook account. Within a week, prosecutors say they unearthed a wealth of social media records.\n\nOn the morning of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Norris sent a message to a group chat: \"Pence don't stand up today what choice do we have but to Riot!!!\"\n\nBy 2:45 p.m. on Jan. 6, Norris allegedly sent another message to the group saying he \"got mace\" and \"breached both sides of the white house brother.\"\n\n\"Your affiant believes that Norris was referring to the U.S. Capitol building but mistakenly called it the 'White House,'\" the statement of facts notes.\n\nOther Facebook Messenger texts showed Norris and another individual talking about bringing weapons to the Capitol, including hornet spray, bear spray and, specifically, the bug spray Raid.\n\nNorris is charged with civil disorder, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds and an act of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or buildings.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together so this is all for the team. I started with McLaren because I believe in them and today proved exactly that.\"\n\nNorris won in his 110th career start after a mistake by Max Verstappen ended Verstappen's dominance at the circuit in the parking lot surrounding Hard Rock Stadium. The 24-year-old driver sprinted down pit lane to leap into the arms of his McLaren crew, which crowd surfed Norris until he finally got to boss Zak Brown, who wrapped Norris in a bearhug.\n\nNorris arrived in Miami with a bandage covering stitches on his nose from a cut received by broken glass while he was in Amsterdam following F1's last outing. Norris was celebrating King's Day with DJ Martin Garrix when he cut his nose.\n\nVerstappen, who started from the pole and won Saturday's sprint race, was out front when he hit a chicane and knocked a cone out of place on the circuit. It forced the three-time reigning F1 champion to pit and gave Norris the lead.\n\nNorris then controlled the race to give McLaren its first win since a Daniel Ricciardo victory in 2021.\n\nLarson edges Buescher: Kyle Larson came around Chris Buescher on the final lap and banged doors with him all the way to the finish line, where he was declared the winner of the Cup Series race by officials at Kansas Speedway in the closest finish in NASCAR history. The official margin was a thousandth of a second.\n\nGolfPendrith gets first PGA Tour victory\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas -- Taylor Pendrith took advantage of Ben Kohles' final-hole meltdown to win the CJ Cup Byron Nelson on Sunday for his first PGA Tour title.\n\nKohles overtook Pendrith with birdies on Nos. 16 and 17 for a one-shot lead, then bogeyed the 18th after hitting his second shot into greenside rough. His first chip didn't reach the green. After having to chip twice from the rough and already looking stunned, Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\nPendrith two-putted for birdie on the 18th, holing a 3-footer for a 4-under 67 and 23-under 261 total. The 32-year-old Canadian won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nKoepka wins LIV Golf Singapore: Brooks Koepka became the first player to win four times on the LIV Golf circuit when he closed with a 3-under 68 in LIV Golf Singapore. Koepka had four birdies and a bogey to finish at 15-under 198 for the three rounds.\n\nDunlap claims rain-shortened Insperity title: Scott Dunlap was declared the 36-hole winner of the Insperity Invitational when rain washed the final round, giving Dunlap his first PGA Tour Champions title in nearly 10 years.\n\nOtaegui rallies to win China Open: Adrian Otaegui overcame a five-shot deficit to win the China Open by closing with a 7-under 65 for the Spaniard's fifth European tour title.\n\nTelevisionKentucky Derby draws 16.7 million viewers\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn. -- Mystik Dan's nose victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby drew 16.7 million viewers, the biggest audience for the race since 1989.\n\nViewership peaked at 20.1 million from 4 to 4:15 p.m. on Saturday, when 18-1 shot Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone and Forever Young hit the wire together in the Derby's first three-horse photo finish since 1947. That marked the biggest peak audience ever for the Derby on NBC.\n\nThe 16.7 million viewers was up 13% from last year's 14.8 million.\n\nNBC Sports said Sunday it was the biggest Derby audience since 18.5 million watched Sunday Silence win in 1989, when the race was shown on ABC.\n\nBriefly\n\nBaseball: The Padres placed pitcher Joe Musgrove on the IL with right elbow inflammation. ... Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan is headed to the IL with a hamstring strain. ... Rays pitcher Ryan Pepiot departed his start after getting hit by a 107.5 mph line drive. ...

However, Alex Albon had a greater impact on Norris than the other two. Their almost four-year age gap made the Thai driver the then-6-year-old Norris' idol. He revealed that in Sky Sports F1's popular lie detector YouTube edition. He confessed how he started admiring Albon from his first karting race as a spectator and even put up a poster of him in his room.\n\n\"This was the time I was more of a Moto GP fan than Formula 1. So I was Valentino Rossi, like everything and he was number 46. So like straight I was like wow, he's Valentino.\", Norris said.\n\n\"But then I also noticed his helmet was in the font of the doctor. So I could tell he was also a Rossi fan. As soon as I knew he was a Rossi fan I was like wow, he's a cool guy. He was a guy I looked up to when I was starting,\" he confessed.\n\nSo, the respect for the Williams man stemmed from their mutual admiration for Valentino Rossi. Perhaps Rossi has had a greater impact on Norris's life. The lure towards the Moto GP legend's style, his striking racing gear, celebrations, helmet, etc ignited the passion for racing in the young Brit.\n\nThe 24-year-old even drew inspiration from the Italian for his racing helmet when he first began racing. In short, it was Rossi's aura that led to Lando Norris becoming the 114th Formula 1 Grand Prix winner.\n\nThe British driver met his hero during the British Motorcycle Grand Prix at Silverstone in 2019. The two met and became close enough to stay in touch. The seven-time Moto GP winner even sent Norris a congratulatory message after his Singapore GP podium.\n\nWonder if he'll receive a text again. Although this friendship is begging to be taken to the track but their busy schedules are hampering those plans.\n\nAfter Lando Norris met the Moto GP serial winner, the two kept in touch. They even plan to race each other despite Rossi retiring from the two-wheeled championship. This hope is kept alive as the 45-year-old switched to four wheels. Since 2022, Rossi has been part of the GT World Challenge Europe.\n\nRossi also confessed about wanting to race Norris, back in 2021. As quoted by Planet F1, he said, \"About racing together next year, for me it would be fantastic because Lando is so fast. I will race in cars and if I can do a race with Lando, for me it will be a great, great pleasure because it is very fast and we can enjoy for sure.\"\n\nThe tribute helmets and bucket hats are the McLaren man's way of showing appreciation. Whereas, Rossi is practicing racing with more wheels so he can challenge his young admirer. Now that Norris has won his maiden F1 race, it would be a great occasion for Rossi to have this one-off race with the Briton.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mahim_suhalka@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Mahim Suhalka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Albon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valentino Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_F1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports F1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kart_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kart racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT_World_Challenge_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GT World Challenge Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/d58cc477-norris-albon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538217", "eventUri": "eng-9538217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

She and her sister started a business as swim instructors, providing backyard lessons for about six years.

After graduating, she wanted to earn some graphic design experience, so she joined a marketing agency in Springdale before opening Norris Design in 2020.\n\nNorris said she started her agency to meet a need, looking to help businesses with brand strategy and \"making stuff that didn't just look nice but serves a good purpose and made sense for the client.\" Along with brand strategy, her agency's services include logo design, content writing and marketing services such as social media, search engine optimization and website design.\n\nThe agency serves clients in Northwest Arkansas and nationwide across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, nonprofits and e-commerce. The agency has six staff.\n\nIn November, Norris and her staff launched BizNWA.com, a directory of area business resources. The volunteer project was developed after multiple clients asked about resources in the area. The website provides a one-stop shop for access to the resources.\n\nAn active volunteer, Norris also mentors the Fuel Accelerator program and is a board member and marketing chair for the nonprofit Women in Networking of Northwest Arkansas.\n\nA career highlight has been helping businesses to grow and reach their goals.

In what was his 110th F1 race, the 24 year old beat world champion Max Verstappen.\n\nAs he celebrated his first win, it's clear that Lando had been waiting a while for this moment to come to fruition. \"About time! What a race. It's been a long time coming,\" he said. \"Finally I've managed to do it.\"\n\nSo, as the F1 driver celebrates his victory, let's take a peek at his life away from the Paddock...\n\nBorn in Bristol, Lando is the son of stock market trader Adam Norris who came in at number 18 on the 2016 Bristol Rich List after amassing a personal fortune of \u00a3205 million.\n\nThe motor racer has two younger sisters, and an older brother and it's clear that his family have been cheering him on from the sidelines. Following his recent win, his doting dad spoke to Sky Sports about his son's victory.\n\n\"It's beautiful, it's beautiful. But I think the other dads... I've just had Lewis' dad give me a text and we've been through a lot. And it's interesting knowing as a parent how many hours you put in supporting them,\" he said.\n\nDespite becoming Fernando Alonso's teammate at the Daytona 24 Hours sports car race in 2018 when he was just 18 years old and racing in his first F1 event a year later, racing wasn't the star's first love.\n\n\"I started on horse riding, so I started on four legs. But then I moved to quad biking. I was a big fan. Then I really got into motocross,\" he told British GQ in 2022.\n\nBut since discovering his talent in racing, Lando's career has gone from strength to strength and in 2022 he committed to a four-year agreement with McLaren. The four-year contract is reportedly estimated to be worth \u00a380 million, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDuring his time in the spotlight, the racing driver has opened up about the pressures that come with working in Formula One and in 2021 he appeared on the This Morning sofa where he discussed all things mental health.\n\n\"I guess people, from when they just watch TV, don't realise many things that a driver goes through,\" he explained. \"And it's a bit of shame, but there are more programmes now where you get to see what the driver is like behind the scenes, and the amount of pressure and stress that they have to cope with.\n\n\"Especially at my age, coming into Formula One at 19, there's a lot of eyes on you. So, dealing with all these kinds of things, took its toll on me.\"\n\nAway from the F1 track Lando likes to keep busy and is the founder of \"entertainment, athlete, and apparel brand\" Quadrant. Co-owned by YouTuber WillNE, the brand sells clothes including hoodies, hats and shorts.\n\nAnd on the topic of YouTube, the McLaren driver has over one million subscribers on the site where he occasionally shares 'LandoLOGs' which provide an insight into his daily life. Meanwhile, a second YouTube channel of his called Lando Norris Plays has racked up 388,000 subscribers and sees him play different video games.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, over on TikTok he has two million followers and on Instagram he has over eight million.\n\nCareer aside, Lando reportedly has a \u00a320 million mansion in Surrey, according to the Daily Mail. However, in 2021 he revealed that he was moving to Monaco and that he was \"excited\" to see what the move had in store.\n\n\"Say hello to my new home! The place isn't finished yet but I'll be living here in Monaco when I'm not in the factory or at the track next year. I get the keys at the end of next month so will hopefully be moving in soon. Really excited for this next chapter!,\" he wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nThe F1 star was previously in a relationship with Portuguese model Luisinha Oliveira, though the couple called time on their romance in 2022. Taking to Instagram to announce the sad news, Lando paid tribute to his \"amazing and strong\" ex-girlfriend.\n\nAfter time and consideration, Luisa and myself have mutually decided to end our relationship but remain good friends,\" he said. \"I wish her the world and have so much respect for her and all she does as an amazing and strong woman with nothing but kindness.\"\n\nSince then Lando has been linked to actress and model Margarida Corceiro and the pair were seen at the Monte-Carlo Masters final last month.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"},

(AP) -- Lando Norris says the online trolling never really bothered him as he went winless through his first five Formula 1 seasons, even when it got worse as one of the breakout stars for fans introduced to the sport through Netflix.\n\nIt was a long wait as Team McLaren got its program together and prepared cars capable of competing with Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. Norris passed the time doom scrolling social media, searching for motivation from his haters.\n\nHis moment came Sunday in his 110th career start when he earned his first victory by beating three-time reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen at the Miami Grand Prix. Verstappen had won the first two races at Miami and Saturday's sprint race before he hit a cone early Sunday to give Norris his opportunity.\n\n\"I never didn't believe in what I could go out and do, so I am happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong,\" Norris said. \"I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me. I freaking love it. It makes me smile more than anything, especially \"Lando No-Wins.\" That's become the thing.\n\n\"For me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face. So I thank all of them.\"\n\nHe turned up at the post-race news conference in a champagne-drenched firesuit. Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton led the congratulatory hugs for Norris, and Verstappen and third-place finisher Charles Leclerc sprayed champagne directly into Norris' face on the podium.\n\nHe had closed his eyes and turned his smiling face to the sky as \"God Save the King\" was played, and he cradled the winning trophy as if it was an infant. He crowd-surfed with his McLaren crew and when he saw boss Zak Brown headed his way, warned 'Don't break my ribs,' in anticipation of the bearhug.\n\n\"I'm shivering like hell because I wanted to keep all my champagne on me,\" Norris laughed, \"and now I'm freaking cold.\"\n\nMcLAREN'S WIN\n\nMcLaren needed this win, its first since 2022 (Daniel Ricciardo, and it came on a weekend in which the team introduced massive upgrades it was certain would make its cars more competitive. The 24-year-old Norris said he arrived Sunday believing he'd win.\n\nNorris had promised his ailing grandmother last week that a victory was on the horizon but allowed \"I didn't think it would be coming this soon.\"\n\nMcLaren this year now has scored wins in F1, Formula E and IndyCar, where Pato O'Ward last week was declared the winner of the season-opening race because Josef Newgarden was disqualified.\n\nThe next three IndyCar weekends are spent at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the buildup to the May 26 Indianapolis 500. McLaren has to be feeling some pressure after a winless 2023 season and somewhat disastrous Indy 500.\n\nMONTH OF MAY\n\nThe McLaren organization is intertwined -- the IndyCar drivers were on social media celebrating Norris as soon as he crossed the finish line -- and the F1 victory is a boost at the perfect time of the season. McLaren is also going to Indy with NASCAR superstar Kyle Larson, who will become the fifth driver in history to attempt to complete 1,100 miles of racing in one day in the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nThe hype surrounding Larson's attempt at \"The Double\" has helped McLaren return to its status as one of the most recognizable brands in motorsports.\n\nIt is all vindication for Brown, an American who started his motorsports career in a marketing role in Indianapolis and now runs one of the largest racing brands on the planet.\n\nBrown likes to stir the pot and ensure drama remains at the front of almost every race weekend, and he was at it again in Miami when he took a shot at Red Bull by implying famed car designer Adrian Newey was leaving the team because of the fallout from an investigation into improper conduct by team principal Christian Horner.\n\nBrown went so far as to say Newey was probably just the first to head for the exit door, an assumption he was making based on \"all the resumes\" flying around the paddock.\n\nHe doesn't let up in IndyCar, either, and rival team owner Chip Ganassi and Brown are not friendly. Brown signed Ganassi driver Alex Palou for 2023 and the two teams used a mediator to battle over the two-time IndyCar champion. It was decided Palou would join McLaren in 2024, but Palou balked last August and is now being sued by McLaren for more than $30 million.\n\nMcLaren last week fired David Malukas before he even made an IndyCar start for the team over injuries he suffered in a mountain bike crash ahead of the season, angering Malukas' millennial fanbase. That followed the unpopular team dismissals of James Hinchcliffe and Oliver Askew, both done after McLaren entered the series with controlling interest of an existing team.\n\nBrown unapologetically chases free agents with little regard to how many seats he actually has open. That's partly how this Palou mess began -- when Palou looked at the F1 landscape, he realized Norris wasn't going anywhere and McLaren would likely never have a seat for him in the series.\n\nIf he was going to stay in IndyCar, then Palou figured he'd stay with the team that helped him to two championships rather than move to winless, revolving-door McLaren. While the decision might ultimately have been the right one for Palou, Brown is digging McLaren out of a decade-long slump and the Norris win has the entire organization feeling unbeatable.\n\nAP F1:

Burr has done seven specials, as well as the movie Old Dads and animated series F Is for Family, for Netflix.\n\nBurr joins Jim Gaffigan as part of Hulu's stand-up roster. The streamer is jumping into the stand-up arena with a new special from Gaffigan that will debut in November, with additional specials to launch monthly after that. A date and title for Burr's set will be announced later.\n\nIn addition to the monthly specials, Hulu is also building out a library of classic stand-up performances and newer specials from production companies 800 Pound Gorilla and Comedy Dynamics.\n\n\"We are excited to round out Hulu's world-class comedy offering with a lineup of some of the funniest voices in stand-up comedy today,\" said Disney Television Group president Craig Erwich when the stand-up venture was announced in May. \"Our slate is a true celebration of the art of stand-up, and we plan to make this a best-in-class destination for comedic talent through partnerships with other areas of The Walt Disney Company, bringing these comedians into our family in a meaningful way.\"\n\nHulu is something of a latecomer to the stand-up game among the big streaming services. Netflix has streamed a host of high-profile specials from Burr, Chris Rock, Hannah Gadsby, John Mulaney, Joe Rogan and many others.

In 2024, Burr is touring arenas and theatres with his Bill Burr Live tour.\n\nHe performed at Gillette Stadium for Tom Brady's induction into the Patriot's Hall of Fame and can be seen as JFK in Jerry Seinfeld's Netflix film, \"Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story.\" In October, Burr's film \"Old Dads,\" which he directed, co-wrote and stars in, premiered as the No. 1 film globally on Netflix for two straight weeks and had over 40 million streams. Other film roles include \"LEO\" alongside Adam Sandler, \"The King of Staten Island\" with Pete Davidson and Marisa Tomei, and \"The Frontrunner\" starring Hugh Jackman. Burr's TV roles include his scene-stealing, fan-favourite role as Migs Mayfeld in \"The Mandalorian\"; Coach Bobson on the hit FX on Hulu series, \"Reservation Dogs\"; and Saul Goodman's henchman, Kuby on \"Breaking Bad.\" In 2023, Burr was the first comedian to perform at the 5,000-seat ancient Roman amphitheater, The Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens, Greece; and in 2022, he made history as the first comedian to perform at Fenway Park.\n\nHulu's new comedy brand will bow in November with Jim Gaffigan and additional comics will be announced at a future date with launch dates for those specials and other information to follow. Hulu will additionally launch a curated collection of licensed stand-up specials ranging from iconic comedy specials to recent releases from 800 Pound Gorilla and Comedy Dynamics, among others.\n\nThis will be Bill Burr's eighth stand-up special, and the launch date will be announced at a later date.\n\nRoger's Take: It's great to see Disney starting to take stand-up comedy seriously and investing more in comedy, especially as Netflix has had so much success with the format, and these shows are going to be much cheaper to produce while also providing more choice for subscribers.\n\nAre you looking forward to watching a Bill Burr stand-up special?

The plan is to have 12 specials across the year with one launching each month.\n\nDeadline understands that Hulu is also in talks with other big names and is close to other deals.\n\nHulu's move comes after Netflix somewhat cornered the stand-up comedy market, paying big money to launch specials from the likes of Chris Rock, Hannah Gadsby, Pete Davidson, Katt Williams as well as its most recent special, Hannah Berner: We Ride At Dawn. It also launched The Roast of Tom Brady, which aired during the Netflix is a Joke festival, and recently announced an upcoming special from controversial podcaster Joe Rogan.\n\nOthers such as Amazon have also been active in the space with the Jeff Bezos-run company launching specials from the likes of Marlon Wayans, Rachel Scanlon and Sam Morrill, whose You've Changed special launched earlier this week. Max recently launched specials from the likes of Nikki Glaser, Hannah Einbinder and Ramy Youssef, while Peacock got in the game with Mike Birbiglia's Good One: A Show About Jokes.\n\nBurr's move to Hulu is significant as he has previously released seven specials on rival Netflix including Live At Red Rocks, Friends Who Kill, Paper Tiger, Walk Your Way Out and I'm Sorry You Feel That Way.\n\nHe

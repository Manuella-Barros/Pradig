We are pleased with our new equipment deliveries in the quarter. Combined with the strong execution of our used equipment strategy, we continue to build equipment population, while also demonstrating resilience and helping offset the impact of lower product support revenue in the quarter.\n\nWe are pleased with our recent strategically important wins in each region, including contracts with multiple copper mines in Chile, the oil sands in Canada, and data centers in the UK and Ireland. These wins represent over $700 million of new equipment orders received in April, which bolster our backlog and demonstrate increasing customer confidence in their markets and our partnership,\" said Kevin Parkes, president and CEO.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nAll comparisons are to Q1 2023 results unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\"Our board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share, marking our 23 consecutive year of growth. This increase is well-supported by our improved earnings capacity and demonstrates our strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nWe remain squarely focused on growing our business in a moderating growth environment through driving product support, building full-cycle resilience by unlocking invested capital, and delivering sustainable growth in used, rental, and power systems. We anticipate the execution of our strategy will have an increasing impact through this year, with improving product support growth rates and substantial free cash flow generation,\" concluded Mr. Parkes.\n\nQ1 2024 HIGHLIGHTS BY OPERATION\n\nAll comparisons are to Q1 2023 results unless indicated otherwise. All numbers, except ROIC, are in functional currency: Canada - Canadian dollar; South America - US dollar (USD); UK & Ireland - UK pound sterling (GBP). These variances and ratios for South America and UK & Ireland exclude the foreign currency translation impact from the CAD relative to the USD and GBP, respectively, and are therefore considered to be specified financial measures. We believe the variances and ratios in functional currency provide meaningful information about operational performance of the reporting segment.\n\nWe have received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") to renew our normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") to purchase for cancellation up to 14,000,000 of our common shares, representing 9.87% of the public float of 141,873,049 common shares as at April 30, 2024. As at April 30, 2024, Finning had a total of 142,174,863 common shares issued and outstanding.\n\nThe NCIB, which will begin on May 13, 2024 and end no later than May 12, 2025, will be conducted through the facilities of the TSX or other Canadian alternative trading systems, if eligible, and will conform to their rules and regulations.\n\nOur Board of Directors believes that, from time to time, the purchase by Finning of its common shares represents a desirable use of its available cash to increase shareholder value.\n\nThe average daily trading volume of our common shares over the six-month period ending April 30, 2024, as calculated in accordance with TSX rules, was 346,060 common shares. Consequently, under TSX rules, we will be allowed to purchase daily, through the facilities of the TSX, a maximum of 86,515 common shares representing 25% of such average daily trading volume, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases. All shares purchased pursuant to the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled.\n\nPurchases under the normal course issuer bid will be made by means of open market transactions or such other means as the TSX may permit. The price to be paid by us for any common share will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees.\n\nIn connection with the NCIB, we will enter into an automatic share purchase plan (\"ASPP\") with a designated broker. The ASPP will allow for the purchase of shares under the NCIB at times when we would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed blackout restrictions.\n\nThe ASPP will provide a set of standard instructions to the designated broker to make purchases under the NCIB in accordance with the limits and other terms set out in the ASPP. The designated broker will determine the timing of these purchases in its sole discretion based on purchasing parameters set by us and subject to the rules of the TSX, applicable securities laws, and the terms of the ASPP. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented as of May 13, 2024. All purchases made under the ASPP will be included in computing the number of shares purchased and cancelled by us under the NCIB. Outside of pre-determined blackout periods, shares may be purchased under the NCIB based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules, and applicable securities laws.\n\nUnder the current NCIB, which expires on May 12, 2024, we obtained approval to purchase up to 14,900,895 common shares. As of April 30, 2024, we purchased and cancelled 7,155,163 common shares under the current NCIB on the open market through the facilities of the TSX and other alternative Canadian trading systems at a volume weighted average price paid of $38.46 per common share (excluding commissions).\n\nMARKET UPDATE AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\nThe discussion of our expectations relating to the market and business outlook in this section is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading \"Forward-Looking Information Caution\" at the end of this news release. Actual outcomes and results may vary significantly.\n\nCanada Operations\n\nOur outlook for Western Canada is positive. While the completion of major pipelines has slowed some construction activities in the near-term, it creates additional capacity to move heavy oil and liquefied natural gas to end markets, and we expect to see increased activity in the energy sector and production growth going forward. Our mining and energy customers are expected to increase spending levels, including investment to renew, maintain, and rebuild aging fleets. In April, we received an order from an oil sands operator for ultra-class trucks for delivery beginning in Q3 2024. Based on customer commitments and discussions, we anticipate strong demand for product support, including component remanufacturing and rebuilds in the oil sands.\n\nWe expect ongoing commitments from federal and provincial governments for infrastructure development to support activity in the construction sector. In addition, growing demand for reliable, efficient, and sustainable electric power solutions across communities in Western Canada creates opportunities for our power systems business.\n\nSouth America Operations\n\nIn Chile, our strong outlook is underpinned by growing global demand for copper, strengthening copper prices, the approvals of large-scale brownfield expansions, and increasing customer confidence to invest in brownfield and greenfield projects. We are seeing a broad-based increase in quoting, tender, and award activity for mining equipment, product support, and technology solutions. In April, we received significant equipment orders from our mining customers totaling $550 million, including a large truck order from an existing global customer framework agreement and a large order from Codelco for ultra-class trucks and ancillary equipment to be delivered to multiple mines and supported under a 10-year maintenance and repair contract. The new Codelco equipment order is valued at $380 million. We expect to start delivering these orders in Q3 2024.\n\nIn the Chilean construction sector, we continue to see healthy demand from large contractors supporting mining operations, and we expect infrastructure construction to remain stable. In the power systems sector, activity remains strong in the industrial and data centre markets, driving growing demand for electric power solutions.\n\nWeaker Chilean peso relative to the US dollar is expected to continue impacting service revenue growth rates in 2024, while also supporting lower SG&A.\n\nIn Argentina, steps are being taken by the new government to address the fiscal imbalances in the country with the goal of ultimately stabilizing inflation and opening the economy for free import and export of goods in the long-term. However, devaluing the currency, containing public spending, reducing subsidies, and lowering spending on public works are driving continued challenging market and operating conditions. We are actively monitoring the new rules and policies to ensure access to hedging is maintained. While we see pockets of strong activity, especially in the oil & gas sector, we are taking a low-risk approach in Argentina in 2024.\n\nUK & Ireland Operations\n\nWith low GDP growth projected in the UK in 2024, we expect demand in the construction sector to remain soft. We expect a growing contribution from used equipment and power systems as we continue to execute on our strategy. In power systems, quoting activity remains strong, driven by healthy demand for primary and backup power generation, particularly in the data centre market. We expect our product support business in the UK & Ireland to remain resilient, driven by growth in rebuilds and Customer Value Agreements.\n\nExecution Focus\n\nWe remain committed to growing our business in 2024 while building more resilience into our operating model and progressing towards our Investor Day targets. We anticipate the execution of our strategy will have an increasing impact through this year, with improving product support growth rates and substantial free cash flow generation.\n\nTo access Finning's complete Q1 2024 results, please visit our website at https://www.finning.com/en_CA/company/investors.html\n\nQ1 2024 INVESTOR CALL\n\nWe will hold an investor call on May 7, 2024 at 10:00 am Eastern Time.

The specified financial measures we use do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, specified financial measures should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP financial measures). By considering these specified financial measures in combination with the comparable GAAP financial measures (where available) we believe that users are provided a better overall understanding of our business and financial performance during the relevant period than if they simply considered the GAAP financial measures alone.\n\nWe use KPIs to consistently measure performance against our priorities across the organization. Some of our KPIs are specified financial measures.\n\nThere may be significant items that we do not consider indicative of our operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount. We exclude these items when evaluating our operating financial performance. These items may not be non-recurring, but we believe that excluding these significant items from GAAP financial measures provides a better understanding of our financial performance when considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Financial measures that have been adjusted to take these significant items into account are referred to as \"Adjusted\" measures. Adjusted measures are specified financial measures and are intended to provide additional information to readers of the Earnings Release.\n\nDescriptions and components of the specified financial measures we use in this Earnings Release are set out below. Where applicable, quantitative reconciliations from certain specified financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (specified, defined, or determined under GAAP and used in our consolidated financial statements) are also set out below.\n\nAdjusted EPS\n\nAdjusted EPS excludes the after-tax per share impact of significant items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance. The tax impact of each significant item is calculated by applying the relevant applicable tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the significant item occurred. The after-tax per share impact of significant items is calculated by dividing the after-tax amount of significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\n\nA reconciliation between EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) and Adjusted EPS can be found on page 9 of this Earnings Release.\n\nAdjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount, to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to Adjusted EBIT.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT is EBIT.\n\nSignificant items identified by management that affected our results were as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for our consolidated operations is as follows:\n\nThe income tax impact of the significant items was as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EPS to Adjusted EPS for our consolidated operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our Canadian operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our South American operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our UK & Ireland operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our Other operations is as follows:\n\nEquipment Backlog\n\nEquipment backlog is defined as the retail value of new equipment units ordered by customers for future deliveries. We use equipment backlog as a measure of projecting future new equipment deliveries. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for equipment backlog.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by or used in operating activities less net additions to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, as disclosed in our financial statements. We use free cash flow to assess cash operating performance, including working capital efficiency. Consistent positive free cash flow generation enables us to re-invest capital to grow our business and return capital to shareholders. A reconciliation from cash flow used in or provided by operating activities to free cash flow is as follows:\n\nInventory Turns (Dealership)\n\nInventory turns (dealership) is the number of times our dealership inventory is sold and replaced over a period. We use inventory turns (dealership) to measure asset utilization. Inventory turns (dealership) is calculated as annualized cost of sales (excluding cost of sales related to the mobile refuelling operations) for the last six months divided by average inventory (excluding inventory related to the mobile refuelling operations), based on an average of the last two quarters. Cost of sales related to the dealership and inventory related to the dealership are calculated as follows:\n\nInvested Capital\n\nInvested capital is calculated as net debt plus total equity. Invested capital is also calculated as total assets less total liabilities, excluding net debt. Net debt is calculated as short-term and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents. We use invested capital as a measure of the total cash investment made in Finning and each reportable segment. Invested capital is used in a number of different measurements (ROIC, Adjusted ROIC, invested capital turnover) to assess financial performance against other companies and between reportable segments. Invested capital is calculated as follows:\n\nInvested Capital Turnover\n\nWe use invested capital turnover to measure capital efficiency. Invested capital turnover is calculated as net revenue for the last twelve months divided by average invested capital of the last four quarters.\n\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as net debt at the reporting date divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months. We use this ratio to assess operating leverage and ability to repay debt. This ratio approximates the length of time, in years, that it would take us to repay debt, with net debt and Adjusted EBITDA held constant.\n\nNet Revenue, Gross Profit as a % of Net Revenue, SG&A as a % of Net Revenue, and EBIT as a % of Net Revenue\n\nNet revenue is defined as total revenue less the cost of fuel related to the mobile refuelling operations in our Canadian operations. As these fuel costs are pass-through in nature for this business, we view net revenue as more representative than revenue in assessing the performance of the business because the rack price for the cost of fuel is fully passed through to the customer and is not in our control. For our South American and UK & Ireland operations, net revenue is the same as total revenue.\n\nWe use these specified financial measures to assess and evaluate the financial performance or profitability of our reportable segments. We may also calculate EBIT as a % of net revenue using Adjusted EBIT to exclude significant items we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nThe ratios are calculated, respectively, as gross profit divided by net revenue, SG&A divided by net revenue, and EBIT divided by net revenue. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to net revenue is total revenue. Net revenue is calculated as follows:\n\nROIC and Adjusted ROIC\n\nROIC is defined as EBIT for the last twelve months divided by average invested capital of the last four quarters, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWe view ROIC as a useful measure for capital allocation decisions that drive profitable growth and attractive returns to shareholders. We also calculate Adjusted ROIC using Adjusted EBIT to exclude significant items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nWorking Capital & Working Capital to Net Revenue Ratio\n\nWorking capital is defined as total current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) less total current liabilities (excluding short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt). We view working capital as a measure for assessing overall liquidity.\n\nThe working capital to net revenue ratio is calculated as average working capital of the last four quarters, divided by net revenue for the last twelve months. We use this KPI to assess the efficiency in our use of working capital to generate net revenue. Working capital is calculated as follows:\n\nThis news release contains information that is forward-looking.

Some of the assumptions, risks, and other factors, which could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking information contained in this news release, are discussed in our current AIF and in our annual and most recent quarterly MD&A for the financial risks. We caution readers that the risks described in the annual and most recent quarterly MD&A and in the AIF are not the only ones that could impact us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\n\nExcept as otherwise indicated, forward-looking information does not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or other unusual items or of any dispositions, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may be announced or that may occur after the date of this news release. The financial impact of these transactions and non-recurring and other unusual items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them.

(TSX: FTT) (\"Finning\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") reported first quarter 2024 results today. All monetary amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n\"I would like to thank our team for their dedication to serving our customers and diligently building execution momentum through our strategic plan. We are pleased with our new equipment deliveries in the quarter. Combined with the strong execution of our used equipment strategy, we continue to build equipment population, while also demonstrating resilience and helping offset the impact of lower product support revenue in the quarter.\n\nWe are pleased with our recent strategically important wins in each region, including contracts with multiple copper mines in Chile, the oil sands in Canada, and data centers in the UK and Ireland. These wins represent over $700 million of new equipment orders received in April, which bolster our backlog and demonstrate increasing customer confidence in their markets and our partnership,\" said Kevin Parkes, president and CEO.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSAll comparisons are to Q1 2023 results unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\"Our board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share, marking our 23rd consecutive year of growth. This increase is well-supported by our improved earnings capacity and demonstrates our strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nWe remain squarely focused on growing our business in a moderating growth environment through driving product support, building full-cycle resilience by unlocking invested capital, and delivering sustainable growth in used, rental, and power systems. We anticipate the execution of our strategy will have an increasing impact through this year, with improving product support growth rates and substantial free cash flow generation,\" concluded Mr. Parkes.\n\nQ1 2024 HIGHLIGHTS BY OPERATIONAll comparisons are to Q1 2023 results unless indicated otherwise. All numbers, except ROIC, are in functional currency: Canada - Canadian dollar; South America - US dollar (USD); UK & Ireland - UK pound sterling (GBP). These variances and ratios for South America and UK & Ireland exclude the foreign currency translation impact from the CAD relative to the USD and GBP, respectively, and are therefore considered to be specified financial measures. We believe the variances and ratios in functional currency provide meaningful information about operational performance of the reporting segment.\n\nCanada Operations\n\nSouth America Operations\n\nUK & Ireland Operations\n\nCorporate and Other Items\n\nRenewal of Share Repurchase Program\n\nWe have received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") to renew our normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") to purchase for cancellation up to 14,000,000 of our common shares, representing 9.87% of the public float of 141,873,049 common shares as at April 30, 2024. As at April 30, 2024, Finning had a total of 142,174,863 common shares issued and outstanding.\n\nThe NCIB, which will begin on May 13, 2024 and end no later than May 12, 2025, will be conducted through the facilities of the TSX or other Canadian alternative trading systems, if eligible, and will conform to their rules and regulations.\n\nOur Board of Directors believes that, from time to time, the purchase by Finning of its common shares represents a desirable use of its available cash to increase shareholder value.\n\nThe average daily trading volume of our common shares over the six-month period ending April 30, 2024, as calculated in accordance with TSX rules, was 346,060 common shares. Consequently, under TSX rules, we will be allowed to purchase daily, through the facilities of the TSX, a maximum of 86,515 common shares representing 25% of such average daily trading volume, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases. All shares purchased pursuant to the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled.\n\nPurchases under the normal course issuer bid will be made by means of open market transactions or such other means as the TSX may permit. The price to be paid by us for any common share will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees.\n\nIn connection with the NCIB, we will enter into an automatic share purchase plan (\"ASPP\") with a designated broker. The ASPP will allow for the purchase of shares under the NCIB at times when we would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed blackout restrictions.\n\nThe ASPP will provide a set of standard instructions to the designated broker to make purchases under the NCIB in accordance with the limits and other terms set out in the ASPP. The designated broker will determine the timing of these purchases in its sole discretion based on purchasing parameters set by us and subject to the rules of the TSX, applicable securities laws, and the terms of the ASPP. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented as of May 13, 2024. All purchases made under the ASPP will be included in computing the number of shares purchased and cancelled by us under the NCIB. Outside of pre-determined blackout periods, shares may be purchased under the NCIB based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules, and applicable securities laws.\n\nUnder the current NCIB, which expires on May 12, 2024, we obtained approval to purchase up to 14,900,895 common shares. As of April 30, 2024, we purchased and cancelled 7,155,163 common shares under the current NCIB on the open market through the facilities of the TSX and other alternative Canadian trading systems at a volume weighted average price paid of $38.46 per common share (excluding commissions).\n\nMARKET UPDATE AND BUSINESS OUTLOOKThe discussion of our expectations relating to the market and business outlook in this section is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading \"Forward-Looking Information Caution\" at the end of this news release. Actual outcomes and results may vary significantly.\n\nCanada Operations\n\nOur outlook for Western Canada is positive. While the completion of major pipelines has slowed some construction activities in the near-term, it creates additional capacity to move heavy oil and liquefied natural gas to end markets, and we expect to see increased activity in the energy sector and production growth going forward. Our mining and energy customers are expected to increase spending levels, including investment to renew, maintain, and rebuild aging fleets. In April, we received an order from an oil sands operator for ultra-class trucks for delivery beginning in Q3 2024. Based on customer commitments and discussions, we anticipate strong demand for product support, including component remanufacturing and rebuilds in the oil sands.\n\nWe expect ongoing commitments from federal and provincial governments for infrastructure development to support activity in the construction sector. In addition, growing demand for reliable, efficient, and sustainable electric power solutions across communities in Western Canada creates opportunities for our power systems business.\n\nSouth America Operations\n\nIn Chile, our strong outlook is underpinned by growing global demand for copper, strengthening copper prices, the approvals of large-scale brownfield expansions, and increasing customer confidence to invest in brownfield and greenfield projects. We are seeing a broad-based increase in quoting, tender, and award activity for mining equipment, product support, and technology solutions. In April, we received significant equipment orders from our mining customers totaling $550 million, including a large truck order from an existing global customer framework agreement and a large order from Codelco for ultra-class trucks and ancillary equipment to be delivered to multiple mines and supported under a 10-year maintenance and repair contract. The new Codelco equipment order is valued at $380 million. We expect to start delivering these orders in Q3 2024.\n\nIn the Chilean construction sector, we continue to see healthy demand from large contractors supporting mining operations, and we expect infrastructure construction to remain stable. In the power systems sector, activity remains strong in the industrial and data centre markets, driving growing demand for electric power solutions.\n\nWeaker Chilean peso relative to the US dollar is expected to continue impacting service revenue growth rates in 2024, while also supporting lower SG&A.\n\nIn Argentina, steps are being taken by the new government to address the fiscal imbalances in the country with the goal of ultimately stabilizing inflation and opening the economy for free import and export of goods in the long-term. However, devaluing the currency, containing public spending, reducing subsidies, and lowering spending on public works are driving continued challenging market and operating conditions. We are actively monitoring the new rules and policies to ensure access to hedging is maintained. While we see pockets of strong activity, especially in the oil & gas sector, we are taking a low-risk approach in Argentina in 2024.\n\nUK & Ireland Operations\n\nWith low GDP growth projected in the UK in 2024, we expect demand in the construction sector to remain soft. We expect a growing contribution from used equipment and power systems as we continue to execute on our strategy. In power systems, quoting activity remains strong, driven by healthy demand for primary and backup power generation, particularly in the data centre market. We expect our product support business in the UK & Ireland to remain resilient, driven by growth in rebuilds and Customer Value Agreements.\n\nExecution Focus\n\nWe remain committed to growing our business in 2024 while building more resilience into our operating model and progressing towards our Investor Day targets. We anticipate the execution of our strategy will have an increasing impact through this year, with improving product support growth rates and substantial free cash flow generation.\n\nTo access Finning's complete Q1 2024 results, please visit our website at https://www.finning.com/en_CA/company/investors.html\n\nQ1 2024 INVESTOR CALLWe will hold an investor call on May 7, 2024 at 10:00 am Eastern Time. Dial-in numbers: 1-844-763-8274 (Canada and US toll free), 1-647-484-8814 (international toll), 44-20-3795-9972 (UK toll). The investor call will be webcast live and archived for three months.

Headquartered in Surrey, British Columbia, we provide Caterpillar equipment, parts, services, and performance solutions in Western Canada, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.\n\nWe believe that certain specified financial measures, including non-GAAP (1) financial measures, provide users of our Earnings Release with important information regarding the operational performance and related trends of our business. The specified financial measures we use do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, specified financial measures should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP financial measures). By considering these specified financial measures in combination with the comparable GAAP financial measures (where available) we believe that users are provided a better overall understanding of our business and financial performance during the relevant period than if they simply considered the GAAP financial measures alone.\n\nWe use KPIs to consistently measure performance against our priorities across the organization. Some of our KPIs are specified financial measures.\n\nThere may be significant items that we do not consider indicative of our operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount. We exclude these items when evaluating our operating financial performance. These items may not be non-recurring, but we believe that excluding these significant items from GAAP financial measures provides a better understanding of our financial performance when considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Financial measures that have been adjusted to take these significant items into account are referred to as \"Adjusted\" measures. Adjusted measures are specified financial measures and are intended to provide additional information to readers of the Earnings Release.\n\nDescriptions and components of the specified financial measures we use in this Earnings Release are set out below. Where applicable, quantitative reconciliations from certain specified financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (specified, defined, or determined under GAAP and used in our consolidated financial statements) are also set out below.\n\nAdjusted EPS\n\nAdjusted EPS excludes the after-tax per share impact of significant items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance. The tax impact of each significant item is calculated by applying the relevant applicable tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the significant item occurred. The after-tax per share impact of significant items is calculated by dividing the after-tax amount of significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\n\nA reconciliation between EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) and Adjusted EPS can be found on page 9 of this Earnings Release.\n\nAdjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount, to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to Adjusted EBIT.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT is EBIT.\n\nSignificant items identified by management that affected our results were as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for our consolidated operations is as follows:\n\nThe income tax impact of the significant items was as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EPS to Adjusted EPS for our consolidated operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our Canadian operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our South American operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our UK & Ireland operations is as follows:\n\nA reconciliation from EBIT to Adjusted EBIT for our Other operations is as follows:\n\nEquipment Backlog\n\nEquipment backlog is defined as the retail value of new equipment units ordered by customers for future deliveries. We use equipment backlog as a measure of projecting future new equipment deliveries. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for equipment backlog.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by or used in operating activities less net additions to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, as disclosed in our financial statements. We use free cash flow to assess cash operating performance, including working capital efficiency. Consistent positive free cash flow generation enables us to re-invest capital to grow our business and return capital to shareholders. A reconciliation from cash flow used in or provided by operating activities to free cash flow is as follows:\n\nInventory Turns (Dealership)\n\nInventory turns (dealership) is the number of times our dealership inventory is sold and replaced over a period. We use inventory turns (dealership) to measure asset utilization. Inventory turns (dealership) is calculated as annualized cost of sales (excluding cost of sales related to the mobile refuelling operations) for the last six months divided by average inventory (excluding inventory related to the mobile refuelling operations), based on an average of the last two quarters. Cost of sales related to the dealership and inventory related to the dealership are calculated as follows:\n\nInvested Capital\n\nInvested capital is calculated as net debt plus total equity. Invested capital is also calculated as total assets less total liabilities, excluding net debt. Net debt is calculated as short-term and long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents. We use invested capital as a measure of the total cash investment made in Finning and each reportable segment. Invested capital is used in a number of different measurements (ROIC, Adjusted ROIC, invested capital turnover) to assess financial performance against other companies and between reportable segments. Invested capital is calculated as follows:\n\nInvested Capital Turnover\n\nWe use invested capital turnover to measure capital efficiency. Invested capital turnover is calculated as net revenue for the last twelve months divided by average invested capital of the last four quarters.\n\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as net debt at the reporting date divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months. We use this ratio to assess operating leverage and ability to repay debt. This ratio approximates the length of time, in years, that it would take us to repay debt, with net debt and Adjusted EBITDA held constant.\n\nNet Revenue, Gross Profit as a % of Net Revenue, SG&A as a % of Net Revenue, and EBIT as a % of Net Revenue\n\nNet revenue is defined as total revenue less the cost of fuel related to the mobile refuelling operations in our Canadian operations. As these fuel costs are pass-through in nature for this business, we view net revenue as more representative than revenue in assessing the performance of the business because the rack price for the cost of fuel is fully passed through to the customer and is not in our control. For our South American and UK & Ireland operations, net revenue is the same as total revenue.\n\nWe use these specified financial measures to assess and evaluate the financial performance or profitability of our reportable segments. We may also calculate EBIT as a % of net revenue using Adjusted EBIT to exclude significant items we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nThe ratios are calculated, respectively, as gross profit divided by net revenue, SG&A divided by net revenue, and EBIT divided by net revenue. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to net revenue is total revenue. Net revenue is calculated as follows:\n\nROIC and Adjusted ROIC\n\nROIC is defined as EBIT for the last twelve months divided by average invested capital of the last four quarters, expressed as a percentage.\n\nWe view ROIC as a useful measure for capital allocation decisions that drive profitable growth and attractive returns to shareholders. We also calculate Adjusted ROIC using Adjusted EBIT to exclude significant items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.\n\nWorking Capital & Working Capital to Net Revenue Ratio\n\nWorking capital is defined as total current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) less total current liabilities (excluding short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt). We view working capital as a measure for assessing overall liquidity.\n\nThe working capital to net revenue ratio is calculated as average working capital of the last four quarters, divided by net revenue for the last twelve months. We use this KPI to assess the efficiency in our use of working capital to generate net revenue. Working capital is calculated as follows:\n\nThis news release contains information that is forward-looking.

Forward-looking information in this news release includes, but is not limited to, the following: all information in the section entitled \"Market Update and Business Outlook\", including for our Canada operations: our outlook for Western Canada being positive; our expectation for increased activity in the energy sector and production growth going forward (based on assumptions of additional capacity created by the completion of major pipelines); our expectations for mining and energy customers increasing their spending levels including investment to renew, maintain, and rebuild aging fleets; our expectation for strong demand for product support, including component remanufacturing and rebuilds in the oil sands (based on customer commitments and discussions); our expectations for the supply of 20 Caterpillar ultra-class trucks to an oil sands operator beginning in Q3 2024; our expectation regarding ongoing commitments from federal and provincial governments for infrastructure development to support activity in the construction sector; our expectations of strong demand for electric power solutions across communities in Western Canada, and that strong demand creates opportunities for our power systems business; for our South America operations: in Chile, our strong outlook based on growing global demand for copper, strengthening copper price, approvals of large-scale brownfield expansions and increasing customer confidence to invest in brownfield and greenfield projects; our expectations related to significant equipment orders received from mining customers in April, including, with respect to Codelco, the expectation for deliveries to begin in Q3 2024, and the related 10-year maintenance and repair contract; our expectation for a weaker Chilean peso relative to the USD to continue impacting service growth rates in 2024, while also supporting lower SG&A; our expectation that infrastructure construction in Chile will remain stable (based on assumptions of continued healthy demand from large contractors supporting mining operations); in the power systems sector, our expectation regarding growing demand for electric power solutions from strong activity in the industrial and data centre markets; in Argentina, our expected low-risk approach in Argentina in 2024; our expectation that steps are being taken by the new government to address the fiscal imbalances in the country with the goal of ultimately stabilizing inflation and opening the economy for free import and export of goods in the long-term; our expectation that devaluing the currency, containing public spending, reducing subsidies, and lowering spending on public works are driving continued challenging market and operating conditions; continued monitoring of new rules and policies to ensure hedging is maintained; our expectation that there will be pockets of strong activity, especially in the oil & gas sector; for our UK & Ireland operations: our expectation for demand in the construction sector to remain soft; our expectation of a growing contribution from used equipment and power systems as we continue to execute on our strategy; in power systems, our expectation of continued strong quoting activity (based on assumptions of healthy demand for primary and backup power generation, particularly in the data centre market); our expectation of our product support business to remain resilient, driven by growth in rebuilds and Customer Value Agreements; and overall: our expectation of growing our business in 2024 while building more resilience into our operating model and progressing towards our Investor Day targets; our expectation that the execution of our strategy will result in increasing impact through this year, with improving product support growth rates and substantial free cash flow generation; the expected renewal of our NCIB and the implementation of the automatic share purchase plan in connection with the NCIB; and the Canadian income tax treatment of the quarterly dividend. All such forward-looking information is provided pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of applicable Canadian securities laws.\n\nUnless we indicate otherwise, forward-looking information in this news release reflects our expectations at the date of this news release. Except as may be required by Canadian securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\nForward-looking information, by its very nature, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and is based on a number of assumptions. This gives rise to the possibility that actual results could differ materially from the expectations expressed in or implied by such forward-looking information and that our business outlook, objectives, plans, strategic priorities and other information that is not historical fact may not be achieved. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking information will materialize.\n\nFactors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by this forward-looking information include: the specific factors stated above; the impact and duration of, and our ability to respond to and manage, high inflation, increasing interest rates, and supply chain challenges; general economic and market conditions, including increasing inflationary cost pressure, and economic and market conditions in the regions where we operate; perspectives of renewed investments in the oil and gas and mining projects in Argentina; government approvals of large-scale brownfield expansions; support and commitment by Canadian federal and provincial governments in infrastructure development; foreign exchange rates; commodity prices; interest rates; the level of customer confidence and spending, and the demand for, and prices of, our products and services; our ability to maintain our relationship with Caterpillar; our dependence on the continued market acceptance of our products, and the timely supply of parts and equipment; our ability to continue to improve productivity and operational efficiencies while continuing to maintain customer service; our ability to manage cost pressures as growth in revenue occurs; our ability to effectively integrate and realize expected synergies from businesses that we acquire; our ability to deliver our equipment backlog; our ability to negotiate satisfactory purchase or investment terms and prices, obtain necessary regulatory or other approvals, and secure financing on attractive terms or at all; our ability to manage our growth strategy effectively; our ability to effectively price and manage long-term product support contracts with our customers; our ability to drive continuous cost efficiency; our ability to attract sufficient skilled labour resources as market conditions, business strategy or technologies change; our ability to negotiate and renew collective bargaining agreements with satisfactory terms for our employees and us; the intensity of competitive activity; our ability to maintain a safe and healthy work environment across all regions; our ability to raise the capital needed to implement our business plan; business disruption resulting from business process change, systems change and organizational change; regulatory initiatives or proceedings, litigation and changes in laws, regulations or policies, including with respect to environmental protection and/or energy transition; stock market volatility; changes in political and economic environments in the regions where we carry on business; our ability to respond to climate change-related risks; the availability of carbon neutral technology or renewable power; the cost of climate change initiatives; the occurrence of one or more natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, geo-political events, acts of terrorism, social unrest or similar disruptions; the availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates and whether the amount of insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all liability or loss that we incur; the potential of warranty claims being greater than we anticipate; and the integrity, reliability and availability of, and benefits from, information technology and the data processed by that technology; and our ability to protect our business from cybersecurity threats or incidents. Forward-looking information is provided in this news release to give information about our current expectations and plans and allow investors and others to get a better understanding of our operating environment. However, readers are cautioned that it may not be appropriate to use such forward-looking information for any other purpose.\n\nForward-looking information provided in this news release is based on a number of assumptions that we believed were reasonable on the day the information was given, including but not limited to: the specific assumptions stated above; that we will be able to successfully manage our business through volatile commodity prices, high inflation, increasing interest rates, and supply chain challenges, and successfully execute our strategies to win customers, achieve full cycle resilience (based on assumptions that steps to reduce corporate overhead, drive productivity and optimize working capital while supporting strong business growth will be successful and sustainable) and continue business momentum (based on assumptions that we will be able to continue to source and hire technicians, build capabilities and capacity and successfully and sustainably improve workshop efficiencies); that commodity prices will remain at constructive levels; that our customers will not curtail their activities; that general economic and market conditions will continue to be strong; that the level of customer confidence and spending, and the demand for, and prices of, our products and services will be maintained; that support and demand for renewable energy will continue to grow; that present supply chain and inflationary challenges will not materially impact large project deliveries in our equipment backlog; our ability to successfully execute our plans and intentions, including our strategic priorities as outlined at our 2023 Investor Day; that we will successfully execute initiatives to reduce our GHG emissions and support our customers on their individual GHG reduction pathways; our ability to attract and retain skilled staff; market competition will remain at similar levels; the products and technology offered by our competitors will be as expected; identified opportunities for growth will result in revenue; that we have sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs; that we will have the funds for share repurchases under the NCIB; consistent and stable legislation in the various countries in which we operate; no disruptive changes in the technology environment; our current good relationships with our customers and suppliers, service providers and other third parties will be maintained and that Caterpillar and such other suppliers will deliver quality, competitive products with supply chain continuity; sustainment of strengthened oil prices; completion of major pipelines and the resulting increased activity in the energy sector; that demand for sustainable electric power solutions in Western Canada will continue to grow; quoting activity for requests for proposals for equipment and product support is reflective of opportunities; and strong recoveries in the regions that we operate. Some of the assumptions, risks, and other factors, which could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking information contained in this news release, are discussed in our current AIF and in our annual and most recent quarterly MD&A for the financial risks. We caution readers that the risks described in the annual and most recent quarterly MD&A and in the AIF are not the only ones that could impact us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\n\nExcept as otherwise indicated, forward-looking information does not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or other unusual items or of any dispositions, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may be announced or that may occur after the date of this news release. The financial impact of these transactions and non-recurring and other unusual items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

(NASDAQ: DCBO; TSX:DCBO) (Docebo or the Company), a leading learning platform provider with a foundation in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation, announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. All amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n\"First quarter revenues and profitability exceeded expectations as Docebo's innovative learning platform continued to gain traction with customers requiring a modern, robust learning solution,\" said Alessio Artuffo, Interim Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer. \"During the quarter, we passed the $200 million mark in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This achievement is only possible thanks to the support of our loyal customers, partners, and Docebians worldwide.\"\n\nKey Performance Indicators and Non-IFRS Measures\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nDocebo is providing financial guidance for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as follows:\n\nManagement expects subscription revenue to grow about one percentage point higher than overall company revenue while professional services revenue to be down sequentially from Q1.\n\nDocebo is providing financial guidance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\nThe information in this section is forward-looking. Please see the sections entitled Non-IFRS Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures and Key Performance Indicators in this press release for how we define Adjusted EBITDA and the section entitled Forward-Looking Information. A reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure is not available without unreasonable effort, as certain items cannot be reasonably predicted because of their high variability, complexity and low visibility. Docebo believes that this type of guidance provides useful insight into the anticipated performance of its business.\n\nRenewal of NCIB\n\nDocebo also announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange has approved its notice of intention to renew its normal course issuer bid (NCIB) for its common shares (Shares). The renewed NCIB will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nPursuant to the notice, Docebo is authorized to acquire up to a maximum of 1,764,037 Shares, or 10% of the Company's public float as of May 6, 2024, for cancellation over the next 12 months. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange, other designated exchanges and/or Canadian alternative trading systems and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements at a price per Share equal to the market at the time of acquisition. The number of Shares that can be purchased pursuant to the NCIB is subject to a current daily maximum of 14,962 Shares (which is equal to 25% of 59,851 Shares, being the average daily trading volume during the six months ended April 30, 2024), in each case subject to Docebo's ability to make one block purchase of Shares per calendar week that exceeds such limits.\n\nDocebo may begin to purchase Shares on or about May 20, 2024 and the bid will terminate on May 19, 2025 or such earlier time as Docebo completes its purchases pursuant to the bid or provides notice of termination. Any Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled upon their purchase. Docebo intends to fund the purchases out of its available cash.\n\nIn connection with the renewal of the NCIB, Docebo has also renewed its automatic securities purchase plan (the Plan) with its designated broker to facilitate the purchase of Shares under the NCIB at times when Docebo would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase Shares due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods.

Docebo may elect to suspend or discontinue its NCIB in accordance with certain conditions set forth in the Plan. The Plan will be effective as of May 20, 2024.\n\nUnder its previous NCIB which commenced on May 18, 2023 and expires on May 17, 2024, Docebo was authorized to repurchase up to 1,650,672 of its common shares, representing approximately 5% of the total shares outstanding. As of May 9, 2024, Docebo has repurchased and cancelled a total of 1,523,608 common shares at an average price of $38.56 (C$51.13) per common share for total cash consideration, including transaction costs, of $58.7 million. All repurchases under the NCIB within the past 12 months were conducted through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange, other designated exchanges and/or Canadian alternative trading systems.\n\nDocebo believes that the purchases are in the best interest of the Company and constitute a desirable use of its funds. The focus of the Company remains on making investments to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the business while creating immediate value for shareholders by executing the NCIB.\n\nConference Call\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Friday, May 10, 2024 at 8:00 am ET to discuss these first quarter results.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include Annual Recurring Revenue, Average Contract Value , Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted, Working Capital and Free Cash Flow.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers.

The NCIB will commence on May 10, 2024, and will terminate on the earlier of May 9, 2025, the date on which the Company has purchased the maximum number of Common Shares permitted under the NCIB or the date on which the NCIB is terminated.\n\nUnder the NCIB, the Company may, over a 12-month period commencing on May 10, 2024, purchase in the normal course through the facilities of the TSX or Canadian alternative trading systems, if eligible, up to 4,542,945 Common Shares, such amount representing 10% of the public float of the Common Shares and approximately 7.3% of the 61,981,519 issued and outstanding Common Shares as at April 30, 2024. Furthermore, subject to certain exemptions for block purchases, the maximum number of Common Shares that the Company may acquire on any one trading day is 16,150 Common Shares, such amount representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of the Common Shares of 64,601 for the six calendar months prior to the start of the NCIB. All Common Shares purchased by the Company under the NCIB will be cancelled.\n\nManagement of Black Diamond believes that, from time to time, the market price of the Common Shares may not fully reflect the underlying value of the Common Shares and that at such time the purchase of the Common Shares represents attractive investment value and would be in the best interests of Black Diamond. The purchase of Common Shares by Black Diamond will increase the proportionate interest of, and be advantageous to, all remaining shareholders.\n\nDuring the prior NCIB of the Company, which terminated on March 13, 2024, the Company obtained approval to purchase 4,396,207 Common Shares, and purchased no Common Shares through the facilities of the TSX and alternative trading systems.\n\nThe Company has engaged Raymond James Ltd. to act as broker and to administer the NCIB.\n\nAbout Black Diamond Group\n\nBlack Diamond is a specialty rentals and industrial services company with two operating business units - Modular Space Solutions (MSS) and Workforce Solutions (WFS). We operate in Canada, the United States, and Australia. MSS through its principal brands, BOXX Modular, Britco, MPA Systems, Schiavi and CL Martin, owns a large rental fleet of modular buildings of various types and sizes.

As previously announced, the purpose of the amendment is to increase the number of common shares that Manulife may repurchase from up to 50 million (approximately 2.8% of shares outstanding) to up to 90 million (approximately 5% of shares outstanding as of February 12, 2024 ). The amendment is effective as of May 13 , 2024. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions previously approved the amended NCIB. Since the commencement of its current NCIB on February 23, 2024 to May 3, 2024 , Manulife has completed the repurchase for cancellation of 12,390,400 common shares at a volume weighted average repurchase price per common share of $32.55 . Under the NCIB, Manulife may purchase up to 1,521,140 of its common shares on the TSX during any trading day, which represents 25% of the average daily trading volume of 6,084,560 common shares on the TSX for the six months ended January 31, 2024, subject to TSX rules permitting block purchases.\n\nContinuing to have an NCIB in place will provide Manulife with the flexibility to purchase common shares as part of its capital management strategy which is designed to maintain healthy regulatory capital ratios while balancing the objective of generating shareholder value. In addition, Manulife intends to repurchase shares in order to mitigate the impact on diluted Earnings Per Share and core Earnings Per Share from previously announced reinsurance transactions, one of which closed in February 2024 and the second of which closed in April 2024 . The actual number of common shares purchased, the timing of such purchases and the price at which common shares are purchased will be determined by Manulife.\n\nManulife's current normal course issuer bid commenced on February 23, 2024 and will continue until February 22, 2025 , when the NCIB expires, or such earlier date as Manulife completes its purchases. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange, and alternative trading systems in Canada and the United States at market prices prevailing at the time of purchase or such other price as may be permitted. All common shares acquired by Manulife under the NCIB will be cancelled. Repurchases will be subject to compliance with applicable Canadian securities laws and United States federal securities laws.\n\nIn addition, Manulife may undertake repurchases of its common shares outside of Canada and the United States in compliance with applicable laws. Subject to regulatory approval, Manulife may also acquire common shares directly from other holders by way of private agreement pursuant to issuer bid exemption orders issued by applicable securities regulatory authorities. Any private purchase made under an exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will generally be at a discount to the prevailing market price. Manulife may also enter into derivative-based programs in support of its repurchase activities, including the writing of put options and forward purchase agreements, accelerated share repurchase transactions, other equity contracts or use other methods of acquiring shares, in each case subject to regulatory approval and on such terms and at such times as shall be permitted by applicable securities laws. The total number of common shares repurchased under the NCIB and all other potential arrangements will not exceed 90 million common shares.\n\nManulife previously entered into an automatic share repurchase plan under which its designated broker will repurchase Manulife's common shares pursuant to the NCIB, and the automatic plan, as will be amended to account for the aforementioned share increase, will continue to apply to the amended NCIB. The actual number of common shares purchased under the automatic plan, the timing of such purchases and the price at which common shares are purchased will depend upon future market conditions. The automatic plan, which was pre-cleared by the TSX, provides for the potential repurchase of common shares at any time, including when Manulife ordinarily would not be active in the market due to its own internal trading blackout periods, insider trading rules, or otherwise.\n\nCaution regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbour\" provisions of Canadian provincial securities laws and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to possible future purchases by Manulife of its common shares. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements involve risks and uncertainties, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Certain material factors or assumptions are applied in making forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual common share repurchases to differ materially from expectations include but are not limited to the fact that the amount and timing of any future common share repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of Manulife, market conditions, capital requirements (including under LICAT capital standards), common share issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including Canadian and U.S. securities laws and Canadian insurance company regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by Manulife, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.\n\nAdditional information about material risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations may be found in our most recent annual and interim reports and elsewhere in our filings with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this document are, unless otherwise indicated, stated as of the date hereof. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n\nAbout Manulife\n\nManulife Financial Corporation is a leading international financial services provider, helping people make their decisions easier and lives better.

Please see the sections entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures\" and \"Key Performance Indicators\" in this press release for how we define \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Information.\" A reconciliation of forward-looking \"Adjusted EBITDA\" to the most directly comparable IFRS measure is not available without unreasonable effort, as certain items cannot be reasonably predicted because of their high variability, complexity and low visibility. Docebo believes that this type of guidance provides useful insight into the anticipated performance of its business.\n\nRenewal of NCIB\n\nDocebo also announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange has approved its notice of intention to renew its normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for its common shares (\"Shares\"). The renewed NCIB will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nPursuant to the notice, Docebo is authorized to acquire up to a maximum of 1,764,037 Shares, or 10% of the Company's public float as of May 6, 2024, for cancellation over the next 12 months. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange, other designated exchanges and/or Canadian alternative trading systems and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements at a price per Share equal to the market at the time of acquisition. The number of Shares that can be purchased pursuant to the NCIB is subject to a current daily maximum of 14,962 Shares (which is equal to 25% of 59,851 Shares, being the average daily trading volume during the six months ended April 30, 2024), in each case subject to Docebo's ability to make one block purchase of Shares per calendar week that exceeds such limits.\n\nDocebo may begin to purchase Shares on or about May 20, 2024 and the bid will terminate on May 19, 2025 or such earlier time as Docebo completes its purchases pursuant to the bid or provides notice of termination. Any Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled upon their purchase. Docebo intends to fund the purchases out of its available cash.\n\nIn connection with the renewal of the NCIB, Docebo has also renewed its automatic securities purchase plan (the \"Plan\") with its designated broker to facilitate the purchase of Shares under the NCIB at times when Docebo would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase Shares due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. Under the Plan, before entering a self-imposed blackout period, Docebo may, but is not required to, ask the designated broker to make purchases under the NCIB within specified parameters. Outside of the pre-determined blackout periods, Shares may be purchased under the NCIB based on the discretion of Docebo's management, in compliance with TSX rules and applicable securities laws. Docebo may elect to suspend or discontinue its NCIB in accordance with certain conditions set forth in the Plan. The Plan will be effective as of May 20, 2024.\n\nUnder its previous NCIB which commenced on May 18, 2023 and expires on May 17, 2024, Docebo was authorized to repurchase up to 1,650,672 of its common shares, representing approximately 5% of the total shares outstanding. As of May 9, 2024, Docebo has repurchased and cancelled a total of 1,523,608 common shares at an average price of $38.56 (C$51.13) per common share for total cash consideration, including transaction costs, of $58.7 million. All repurchases under the NCIB within the past 12 months were conducted through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange, other designated exchanges and/or Canadian alternative trading systems.\n\nDocebo believes that the purchases are in the best interest of the Company and constitute a desirable use of its funds. The focus of the Company remains on making investments to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the business while creating immediate value for shareholders by executing the NCIB.\n\nConference Call\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Friday, May 10, 2024 at 8:00 am ET to discuss these first quarter results.

In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, intentions, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking information. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management's expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or circumstances.\n\nThis forward-looking information in this press release includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding the Company's business; the guidance for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue discussed under \"Financial Outlook\" in this press release; our 2024 product roadmap, the expanded use of AI across our platform; future financial position and business strategy; the learning management industry; our growth rates and growth strategies; addressable markets for our solutions; the achievement of advances in and expansion of our platform; expectations regarding our revenue and the revenue generation potential of our platform and other products; our business plans and strategies; and our competitive position in our industry.

Despite a careful process to prepare and review the forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. Certain assumptions include: our ability to build our market share and enter new markets and industry verticals; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our ability to maintain and expand geographic scope; our ability to execute on our expansion plans; our ability to continue investing in infrastructure to support our growth; our ability to obtain and maintain existing financing on acceptable terms; our ability to execute on profitability initiatives; currency exchange and interest rates; the impact of inflation and global macroeconomic conditions; the impact of competition; our ability to respond to the changes and trends in our industry or the global economy; and the changes in laws, rules, regulations, and global standards are material factors made in preparing forward-looking information and management's expectations.\n\nForward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, estimates and assumptions that, while considered by the Company to be appropriate and reasonable as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to:\n\nOur guidance for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue is subject to certain assumptions and associated risks as stated under \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" and in particular the following:\n\nIf any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the opinions, estimates or assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, actual results or future events might vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking information. The opinions, estimates or assumptions referred to above and described in greater detail in the \"Summary of Factors Affecting our Performance\" section of our MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and in the \"Risk Factors\" section of our AIF, should be considered carefully by prospective investors.\n\nAlthough we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information, which speaks only as of the date made. The forward-looking information contained in this press release represents our expectations as of the date specified herein, and are subject to change after such date. However, we disclaim any intention or obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities laws.\n\nAll of the forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements.\n\nAdditional information relating to Docebo, including our AIF, can be found on SEDAR+ at www.sedar.com.\n\nAbout Docebo\n\nDocebo is redefining the way enterprises leverage technology to create and manage content, deliver training, and measure the business impact of their learning programs.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include \"Annual Recurring Revenue\", \"Average Contract Value \", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Net Income\", \"Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted\", \"Working Capital\" and \"Free Cash Flow\".\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company's performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue and Average Contract Value as at March 31 was as follows:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding net finance income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, other income, foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition related compensation, transaction related expenses and restructuring costs, if any.\n\nThe IFRS measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA presented in our financial statements is net income.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods indicated:\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted\n\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income excluding amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, acquisition related compensation, transaction related expenses, restructuring costs, foreign exchange gains and losses, and income taxes.\n\nAdjusted Earnings per share - basic and diluted is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of common shares (basic and diluted).\n\nThe IFRS measure most directly comparable to Adjusted Net Income presented in our financial statements is net income.\n\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted Net Income for the periods indicated:\n\nWorking Capital\n\nWorking Capital as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $27.4 million and $180.0 million, respectively. Working Capital is defined as current assets, excluding the current portion of the net investment in finance lease and contract costs, minus current liabilities, excluding borrowings, if any, and the current portion of contingent consideration and lease obligations. Working Capital is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nThe following table represents the Company's working capital position as at March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs, plus non-recurring expenditures such as the payment of acquisition-related compensation, the payment of transaction-related costs, and the payment of restructuring costs. Free Cash Flow is not a recognized measure under IFRS. The IFRS measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow presented in our financial statements is cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Performance indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conference call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_trading_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alternative trading system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Financial Reporting Standards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transaction cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_float", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public float"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDGAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EDGAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547769", "eventUri": "eng-9547769", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 14997, "textEnd": 15005}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 2375, "textEnd": 2381, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 2418, "textEnd": 2424}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 3607, "textEnd": 3613}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 3635, "textEnd": 3641, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 4590, "textEnd": 4596}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

If this notice is accepted by the TSX, the Company expects to purchase for cancellation, at its discretion during the 12 months following such acceptance, up to 14,750,000 Class B non-voting shares representing approximately 9.93% of the public float of the Class B non-voting shares of the Company. Purchases under the NCIB will be conducted in the open market or as otherwise permitted, subject to the terms and limitations applicable to the NCIB. The actual number of Class B non-voting shares that may be purchased under the NCIB, and the timing of any such purchases, will be determined by the Company, subject to the limitations imposed by the TSX.

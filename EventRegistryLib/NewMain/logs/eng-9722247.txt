What does that mean for patients and rural health care?", "body": "Both systems announced Wednesday plans to combine, creating an integrated health system in the rural Midwest. What does it mean for employees, patients and rural health care?\n\nMARSHFIELD - Marshfield Clinic Health System plans to combine with Sanford Health later this year.\n\nThe nonprofit health systems announced Wednesday morning in a joint release their intent to combine their assets and capabilities to create an integrated health system and advance health care in the rural Midwest. Sanford Health serves communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, while Marshfield Clinic Health System serves in communities throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe partnership is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory processes and closing conditions. Both companies will remain separate and independent organizations until the deal is closed.\n\nWhen the deal is complete, Sanford Health will serve as the parent company, headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Marshfield Clinic Health System will be a region within Sanford Health and will maintain regional leadership and its flagship campus in Marshfield, keep its regional board of directors and regional physician executive council and maintain its brand, according to the release.\n\nSanford Health President and CEO Bill Gassen will serve as president and CEO of the combined system, and Marshfield Clinic Health System Interim CEO Dr. Brian Hoerneman will serve as president and CEO of the Marshfield Clinic Health System region.\n\nGassen and Hoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there may be opportunities to co-brand certain services or programs in the future, but both Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will maintain their existing branding and names.\n\nAccording to the release, there are no immediate changes planned for employees or systems. When the two organizations combine, they will operate 56 hospitals with 56,000 employees and 4,300 providers. The organizations' nationally recognized research institutions, specialty pharmacies and health plans -- Sanford Health Plan and Security Health Plan -- will be integrated, as well.\n\nA 'crisis' in rural health care:Wisconsin hospital systems face increasing challenges in providing services in rural communities\n\nWhat is Sanford Health?\n\nAccording to the release, Sanford Health is the largest rural health system in the country. About 2,900 Sanford physicians and providers serve 1.4 million patients through 45 hospitals, 221 clinics and more than 160 Good Samaritan Society senior living centers. Sanford Health is running 540 active clinical trials and operates nine Sanford World Clinic locations around the world, offering broad primary care services, regenerative medicine, specialized procedures and more services to populations around the world.\n\nAccording to its website, Sanford Health operates various Centers of Excellence, focusing on cancer care, children's health, heart, women's health and orthopedics and sports medicine.\n\nAccording to the release, Sanford Health has invested more than $1.5 billion in communities across South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa over the last 10 years, expanding access to specialty care and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nWhat is Marshfield Clinic Health System?\n\nMore than 1,400 providers serve Marshfield Clinic Health System across Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, focusing on 170 specialties. Marshfield Clinic Health System operates research and education programs and its Security Health Plan.\n\nMarshfield Clinic Health System operates more than 60 Marshfield Clinic sites, 11 hospitals, Marshfield Children's Hospital, the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute and the Marshfield Clinic Health System Foundation.\n\nWhat does this partnership mean for patients?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter patients will see very little change in service, especially at the beginning of the partnership. He said since Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System are closely aligned in their missions and the challenges they face, the connection between the two organizations will continue to prioritize continued and improved access to rural areas.\n\nGassen agreed, adding patients can expect to see continued investment in communities and expanded access in the years to come, both from Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System. They want to build on the decades of work each system has already brought to communities and work to meet changing demands in financially sustainable ways, he said.\n\nHow is this partnership different than other merger attempts?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter other attempts at mergers -- like discussions Marshfield Clinic Health System had with Essentia Health -- were lengthy discussions that ultimately ended with both organizations open to future collaborations on projects but weren't a good fit to merge.\n\nDiscussions around the partnership with Sanford Health have been entirely different, Hoerneman said. Both organizations have similar missions and culture and have aligned priorities to focus on serving rural communities.\n\nGassen said there are many commonalities between the two organizations, from a shared mission and values to prioritizing communities while working to improve access, quality and availability of rural health care. He said a common sentiment shared as both organizations continued discussions was how natural the fit feels between the two.\n\nIn the news release, Hoerneman said the partnership offers an \"incredible opportunity\" to unify the organizations and establish a premier rural health system in the country.\n\n\"Together, we will ensure sustainable access to exceptional care for our communities for years to come,\" Hoerneman said. \"With a shared mission to serve, a mutual emphasis on research and education, and a strong tradition of physician leadership, Sanford Health is the ideal partner for this endeavor.\"\n\nHow will this help address challenges in providing rural health care?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there are many challenges both organizations have been facing when it comes to providing rural health care, including insufficient or declining reimbursement rates, increasing costs of pharmaceuticals, increasing costs related to attracting and retaining skilled staff, supply costs and more.\n\nHoerneman said the collaboration with Sanford Health will allow both organizations to address some of the biggest issues in providing rural health care head-on. Combined, both organizations reach rural communities on more of a national scale, and together, they can work to determine best practices and understand how they can offer better access and better care that is still cost-efficient. Some issues are bigger than any health system can solve on its own, Hoerneman said, but they're important to discuss, as communities depend on systems like Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System.\n\nOne challenge in providing rural health care, especially in Wisconsin, has been serving an aging population. Sanford Health has been working with an affiliate, the Good Samaritan Society, since 2019, Gassen said. That partnership has allowed Sanford Health to invest in senior care locations and nursing and rehab facilities. When those two organizations merged, it created unique opportunities for Sanford Health to meet existing demands for acute and post-acute care.\n\nAnother challenge has been maintaining enough staffing to provide seamless care and transitions for patients. Many rural communities struggle with a nursing home \"bottleneck,\" causing patient backups all the way to emergency departments. Gassen said the Sanford locations in communities that work with the Good Samaritan Society are better staffed, have had more seamless transitions and are able to optimize care and efficiency. Locations without that partnership have seen similar struggles.\n\nA benefit of partnering Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will be listening to what programs and efforts are working and collaborating on ways to work together to create programs and opportunities to solve some of the biggest challenges, Gassen said.\n\nWhat does this partnership mean for rural medical care and research?\n\nAccording to the release, combining Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will improve patient outcomes by providing broader health initiatives, care programs and innovative care delivery models. The partnership aims to utilize technology to focus on virtual care, digital health, data analytics and use artificial intelligence and genomic medicine to advance community health.\n\nCombining Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System would also strengthen training, education and support for future physicians and caregivers through shared initiatives. According to the release, the combined organizations would create graduate medical education programs and establish strong partnerships with educational institutions across the shared region.\n\nAccording to the release, the partnership would create new opportunities for research, collaboration, enhanced professional development and training and would create robust peer networks.\n\nGassen told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there are already great opportunities in front of Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System, including offering more than 1,000 clinical trials neither organization could do on its own. Those trials bring more opportunities for more cures for more patients, he said. Together, the two organizations can work together to address challenges and advocate for the right programs that are needed in rural communities in sustainable ways, he said.\n\nWhat about health insurance?\n\nHoerneman and Gassen said Sanford Health Plan and Security Health Plan will continue as separate and distinct legal entities but will share common governance. They said patients with these plans will see very little change as the partnership deal finalizes.\n\nFor patients who have outside health insurance coverage from other companies, both Hoerneman and Gassen said they don't foresee any coverage changes for patients. Both said health insurance plans are important pieces of providing quality rural health care, and both organizations want to continue expanding patient access to care.", "source": {"uri":

What does that mean for patients and rural health care?", "body": "Both systems announced Wednesday plans to combine, creating an integrated health system in the rural Midwest. What does it mean for employees, patients and rural health care?\n\nMARSHFIELD - Marshfield Clinic Health System plans to combine with Sanford Health later this year.\n\nThe nonprofit health systems announced Wednesday morning in a joint release their intent to combine their assets and capabilities to create an integrated health system and advance health care in the rural Midwest. Sanford Health serves communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, while Marshfield Clinic Health System serves in communities throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe partnership is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory processes and closing conditions. Both companies will remain separate and independent organizations until the deal is closed.\n\nWhen the deal is complete, Sanford Health will serve as the parent company, headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Marshfield Clinic Health System will be a region within Sanford Health and will maintain regional leadership and its flagship campus in Marshfield, keep its regional board of directors and regional physician executive council and maintain its brand, according to the release.\n\nSanford Health President and CEO Bill Gassen will serve as president and CEO of the combined system, and Marshfield Clinic Health System Interim CEO Dr. Brian Hoerneman will serve as president and CEO of the Marshfield Clinic Health System region.\n\nGassen and Hoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there may be opportunities to co-brand certain services or programs in the future, but both Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will maintain their existing branding and names.\n\nAccording to the release, there are no immediate changes planned for employees or systems. When the two organizations combine, they will operate 56 hospitals with 56,000 employees and 4,300 providers. The organizations' nationally recognized research institutions, specialty pharmacies and health plans -- Sanford Health Plan and Security Health Plan -- will be integrated, as well.\n\nWhat is Sanford Health?\n\nAccording to the release, Sanford Health is the largest rural health system in the country. About 2,900 Sanford physicians and providers serve 1.4 million patients through 45 hospitals, 221 clinics and more than 160 Good Samaritan Society senior living centers. Sanford Health is running 540 active clinical trials and operates nine Sanford World Clinic locations around the world, offering broad primary care services, regenerative medicine, specialized procedures and more services to populations around the world.\n\nAccording to its website, Sanford Health operates various Centers of Excellence, focusing on cancer care, children's health, heart, women's health and orthopedics and sports medicine.\n\nAccording to the release, Sanford Health has invested more than $1.5 billion in communities across South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa over the last 10 years, expanding access to specialty care and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nWhat is Marshfield Clinic Health System?\n\nMore than 1,400 providers serve Marshfield Clinic Health System across Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, focusing on 170 specialties. Marshfield Clinic Health System operates research and education programs and its Security Health Plan.\n\nMarshfield Clinic Health System operates more than 60 Marshfield Clinic sites, 11 hospitals, Marshfield Children's Hospital, the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute and the Marshfield Clinic Health System Foundation.\n\nWhat does this partnership mean for patients?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter patients will see very little change in service, especially at the beginning of the partnership. He said since Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System are closely aligned in their missions and the challenges they face, the connection between the two organizations will continue to prioritize continued and improved access to rural areas.\n\nGassen agreed, adding patients can expect to see continued investment in communities and expanded access in the years to come, both from Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System. They want to build on the decades of work each system has already brought to communities and work to meet changing demands in financially sustainable ways, he said.\n\nHow is this partnership different than other merger attempts?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter other attempts at mergers -- like discussions Marshfield Clinic Health System had with Essentia Health -- were lengthy discussions that ultimately ended with both organizations open to future collaborations on projects but weren't a good fit to merge.\n\nDiscussions around the partnership with Sanford Health have been entirely different, Hoerneman said. Both organizations have similar missions and culture and have aligned priorities to focus on serving rural communities.\n\nGassen said there are many commonalities between the two organizations, from a shared mission and values to prioritizing communities while working to improve access, quality and availability of rural health care. He said a common sentiment shared as both organizations continued discussions was how natural the fit feels between the two.\n\nIn the news release, Hoerneman said the partnership offers an \"incredible opportunity\" to unify the organizations and establish a premier rural health system in the country.\n\n\"Together, we will ensure sustainable access to exceptional care for our communities for years to come,\" Hoerneman said. \"With a shared mission to serve, a mutual emphasis on research and education, and a strong tradition of physician leadership, Sanford Health is the ideal partner for this endeavor.\"\n\nHow will this help address challenges in providing rural health care?\n\nHoerneman told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there are many challenges both organizations have been facing when it comes to providing rural health care, including insufficient or declining reimbursement rates, increasing costs of pharmaceuticals, increasing costs related to attracting and retaining skilled staff, supply costs and more.\n\nHoerneman said the collaboration with Sanford Health will allow both organizations to address some of the biggest issues in providing rural health care head-on. Combined, both organizations reach rural communities on more of a national scale, and together, they can work to determine best practices and understand how they can offer better access and better care that is still cost-efficient. Some issues are bigger than any health system can solve on its own, Hoerneman said, but they're important to discuss, as communities depend on systems like Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System.\n\nOne challenge in providing rural health care, especially in Wisconsin, has been serving an aging population. Sanford Health has been working with an affiliate, the Good Samaritan Society, since 2019, Gassen said. That partnership has allowed Sanford Health to invest in senior care locations and nursing and rehab facilities. When those two organizations merged, it created unique opportunities for Sanford Health to meet existing demands for acute and post-acute care.\n\nAnother challenge has been maintaining enough staffing to provide seamless care and transitions for patients. Many rural communities struggle with a nursing home \"bottleneck,\" causing patient backups all the way to emergency departments. Gassen said the Sanford locations in communities that work with the Good Samaritan Society are better staffed, have had more seamless transitions and are able to optimize care and efficiency. Locations without that partnership have seen similar struggles.\n\nA benefit of partnering Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will be listening to what programs and efforts are working and collaborating on ways to work together to create programs and opportunities to solve some of the biggest challenges, Gassen said.\n\nWhat does this partnership mean for rural medical care and research?\n\nAccording to the release, combining Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will improve patient outcomes by providing broader health initiatives, care programs and innovative care delivery models. The partnership aims to utilize technology to focus on virtual care, digital health, data analytics and use artificial intelligence and genomic medicine to advance community health.\n\nCombining Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System would also strengthen training, education and support for future physicians and caregivers through shared initiatives. According to the release, the combined organizations would create graduate medical education programs and establish strong partnerships with educational institutions across the shared region.\n\nAccording to the release, the partnership would create new opportunities for research, collaboration, enhanced professional development and training and would create robust peer networks.\n\nGassen told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter there are already great opportunities in front of Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System, including offering more than 1,000 clinical trials neither organization could do on its own. Those trials bring more opportunities for more cures for more patients, he said. Together, the two organizations can work together to address challenges and advocate for the right programs that are needed in rural communities in sustainable ways, he said.\n\nWhat about health insurance?\n\nHoerneman and Gassen said Sanford Health Plan and Security Health Plan will continue as separate and distinct legal entities but will share common governance. They said patients with these plans will see very little change as the partnership deal finalizes.\n\nFor patients who have outside health insurance coverage from other companies, both Hoerneman and Gassen said they don't foresee any coverage changes for patients. Both said health insurance plans are important pieces of providing quality rural health care, and both organizations want to continue expanding patient access to care.", "source": {"uri":

It serves 45 communities across Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nThe combined organization would have had $10.3 billion in revenue in 2023, ranking it just outside the nation's top 20 largest health systems.\n\nThe combined organization would retain the Sanford Health name and be based in Sioux Falls, with Sanford CEO Bill Gassen as its leader. Marshfield Clinic Health System would become a region within Sanford Health, similar to Sioux Falls, Fargo, Bismarck and Bemidji, led by current interim CEO Dr. Brian Hoerneman.\n\n\"Sanford Health has an appreciation for the value of good, strategic partnerships,\" Gassen said. \"Sanford Health only exists today because of the benefit of coming together with so many like-minded organizations over the years. We've seen the great benefits that are derived from good, mission-oriented, patient-centric organizations coming together.\"\n\nFor both systems, the proposed merger follows a failed attempt at combining with other health systems. Less than a year ago, Sanford's second attempt to merge with Minnesota-based Fairview Health Services ended with both systems deciding to discontinue the process.\n\nMarshfield experienced a similar outcome earlier this year after attempting to merge with Minnesota-based Essentia Health since 2022. They issued a joint statement that combining was \"not the right path forward for our respective organizations, colleagues and patients.\"\n\nSanford also discontinued mergers with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare in 2021 and Iowa-based UnityPoint Health in 2019.\n\nFrom the outside, \"this is going to sound very familiar to people when they hear about it,\" Gassen acknowledged.\n\nThe common factor in this case, though, is the shared culture of rural health care, he said. Marshfield is a community of less than 20,000 in central Wisconsin. The larger geographies served by the health system are in places such as Wausau and Eau Claire, which are both metro areas smaller than Sioux Falls.\n\n\"Two-thirds of the patients we serve at Sanford come to us from rural communities,\" Gassen said. \"We've been very outspoken about our aspiration to be the premier rural health system in the U.S. It's an amazing opportunity to bring together these complementary organizations. I suspect as we share that news it's going to make a lot of sense to people. It's going to fit.\"\n\nSanford reported $7.2 billion in revenue and operating income of $402.2 million in 2023, which is more than double the $192.3 million it posted in 2022, and is \"off to another great start\" this year, Gassen said.\n\n\"I think even more important than that was our progression against our targets to continue to improve our quality and access,\" he said.\n\nMarshfield currently is implementing a financial improvement plan following several years of losses, including $367.9 million in 2022 and $250 million in 2023.\n\n\"We really have made tremendous progress around addressing our financial challenges,\" said Hoerneman, who became interim CEO in September 2023 but has been with the system for almost 20 years and still practices as an emergency room physician.\n\nHe points to the challenges of providing care in a rural geography along with declining reimbursement and increased cost of pharmaceuticals, labor and supplies. The system furloughed about 3 percent of its workforce earlier this year and ended up eliminating the jobs, mostly back-office and leadership positions, according to multiple reports.\n\nPart of turning around its financial performance included \"finding ways to reduce cost, how can we be more efficient looking at things like overhead while making sure we have the front-line clinical staff where they need to be,\" Hoerneman said.\n\n\"That financial improvement plan has been very successful in 2024. We had a positive first quarter for the first time the organization has seen that in a couple of years, so the fact that we're on a much better trajectory from that perspective has been a boost to the entire organization.\"\n\nMarshfield reported positive operating income of $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, versus a loss of $42.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFitch Ratings recently revised its 2024 outlook for Marshfield from negative to stable while maintaining a BBB rating, forecasting a positive operating EBITDA margin of 7 percent this year \"as the system continues to implement a comprehensive operating improvement plan,\" it said. \"MCHS is beginning to see the benefits of labor force efficiencies, revenue-cycle enhancement and other measures.\"\n\nThe combined Sanford system would total 56,000 employees, 56 hospitals, 4,300 providers, two fully integrated health plans, specialty pharmacies and nationally recognized research institutions.\n\n\"We're really excited about the combination and the chance for us to move forward,\" Hoerneman said. \"As we've gotten further along in the partnership, it's become really clear how much similarity we share along the culture aspect -- the values and the vision for the future. We've had great conversations with the Sanford Health team and have really gotten to know them well and just found a great degree of alignment between our two organizations.\"\n\nBetween the systems' two health plans -- Sanford Health Plan and Security Health Plan, which is part of Marshfield -- 425,000 members would be served. Security is slightly larger, covering 225,000 members. Both systems pointed to the benefits of integration in maximizing benefits.\n\nMarshfield Clinic Research Institute is the largest private medical research institute in Wisconsin, with more than 30 Ph.D. and M.D. scientists and 200 additional staff, along with 150 physicians and other health care professionals who are engaged in medical research. The combined organization with Sanford would offer access to almost 1,000 active clinical trials.\n\n\"There's so much that we have in common from the way we see the world; it's going to allow us to do a better job addressing the three biggest challenges we face: how do we continue to improve access, how do we continue to improve quality and how do we do that in a financially sustainable way,\" Gassen said.\n\n\"As I've had the opportunity and the Sanford board of trustees has had the opportunity to interact with Dr. Hoerneman and his team and great board, every time we do this we sort of walk away with a very similar statement, which is that it felt really natural.\"\n\nFollowing the completion of the merger, the plan is for Marshfield to nominate three people, including an independent physician from outside the health system, to join the Sanford Health board of trustees, growing it to 15 members. One Marshfield board member would serve on the executive committee.\n\nBoard chairs of both organizations provided supportive comments in a statement sent today.\n\nMarshfield Clinic Health System board chair Dr. George Brown said the partnership \"marks a new chapter in our organization, and we look forward to serving our patients as the nationwide leader in rural health care.\"\n\nSanford Health board of trustees chair Lauris Molbert called it a \"win-win for the patients and communities we serve and for our organizations that have had a long tradition of innovation, physician leadership and dedicated caregivers,\" adding that the combination \"will strengthen local, patient-centered nonprofit health care for generations to come.\"\n\nThe merger is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory processes and closing conditions.", "source": {"uri": "siouxfalls.business", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiouxFalls.Business"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(WSAW) - Marshfield Clinic has planned to combine with a Sioux Falls-based health care system.\n\nSanford Health and Marshfield Clinic announced a plan to combine their assets and capabilities and create an integrated health system. The combination is expected to close by the end of the year.\n\nThere are no immediate changes for employees or those each system serves. According to a news release, Sanford Health and Marshfield Clinic Health System will remain two separate, independent organizations until the closing.\n\nAccording to Marshfield Clinic Health System Board Chair George Brown, M.D.: \"The partnership marks a new chapter in our organization, and we look forward to serving our patients as the nationwide leader in rural health care.\"\n\nCombined, the health care systems say they'll have a stronger ability to improve patient outcomes through technology and research capabilities.

Hanson offered words of appreciation for all those who made the new Digestive Health Center possible and how he is grateful to be a part of it, and other ventures and additional services during the past decade.\n\n\"We would not be able to do this without the generosity of so many people and obviously, Mr. (T. Denny) Sanford, who continues to demonstrate his commitment to our organization and our vision and providing care today and for tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nFollowing was Sanford Gastroenterologist Dr. Jeffrey Murray, M.D., who has been practicing with Sanford Health for 36 years.\n\n\"This new space has been a dream of mine for close to a decade,\" Murray said. \"And I'm very grateful to those who have shared that dream with me.\"\n\nHe said that after touring other facilities nationwide, there is \"nothing quite like\" the Sanford Center for Digestive Health.\n\n\"This is truly a unique design catered toward the convenience and the comfort of our patients,\" he said.\n\nMurray will also oversee the Sanford Medical Education GI Fellowship Program, a three-year program done after a medical resident finishes their internal medicine residency. It's the first and only program of its kind in the Dakotas.\n\n\"We now have the privilege to educate, train and produce top-performing gastroenterologists,\" Murray said. \"This is another important step in establishing Sanford Health as the destination for gastroenterology care on our way to becoming the premier rural health system in the country.\"\n\nMurray said by next year, gastroenterology is expected to be down more than 1,600 doctors, emphasizing the crucial need for these new services.\n\nMore: Rural and reservation health providers in South Dakota face high hurdles\n\nGI covers everything involving the digestive tract and diseases, including gall bladder disease and pancreatic cancer, which is on a \"tremendous rise,\" Murray said.\n\nDr. Jorge Gilbert, a Sanford Gastroenterologist of 23 years, reiterated the importance of training new and existing providers, saying it will make them better doctors and in turn, provide better patient care.\n\nConcluding the list of speakers was Lawrence & Schiller CEO and Chair of the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors Scott Lawrence, who presented a plaque commemorating the occasion.\n\nTours were then given after the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the new facility. Blue Rock Bar & Grill catered the event.\n\nConstruction for the Sanford Digestive Health Center in Medical Building 1 began in early 2022 and was estimated to cost about $4 million.\n\nThe new 237,000-square-foot, five-story MB1 features 400 parking spaces for patients and employees on the first four floors, with the top floor housing the Sanford Center for Digestive Health.\n\nThe 45,000-square-foot building also features 10 procedure rooms and 40 pre and post-procedure rooms. The center also includes a fellowship program space, a dedicated workspace for students as well as an endoscopic simulation space for trainees to learn endoscopic techniques.\n\nThe GI fellowship will welcome its first fellows in July 2025, according to Sanford Health's website.\n\nThis Fellowship Program is made possible by a $300 million donation from Sanford, the health organization said. The fellowship was designated and earmarked as the first of several fellowships to be created through Sanford's recent donation, Murray said.\n\nMore than 20 GI providers will work in the new building, where all the clinic space is adjacent to the procedure space on the top floor of MB1. The new build also has the ability to expand three additional levels for future growth.\n\nThis is the biggest individual building project for Sanford Health's main campus since the completion of the 105,700-square-foot Imagenetics Building in 2017 and follows the $160 million Van Demark building expansion in 2022.\n\n\"Fulfilling our promise to be here for all, here for good is something we work toward every day at Sanford,\" Essig said. \"And we are proud to mark another milestone along the way with the opening of our Sanford Center for Digestive Health and Medical Building One.\"",

It will be operated on a 24/7 basis,\" as the lab is now, Jarvis said.\n\nThe PRACS Building has an address of 4801 Amber Valley Parkway S., but there are several entrances and several addresses attributed to the sprawling structure. The first phase of the consolidation at 4840 23rd Ave. S. will cost about $6.5 million, Sanford spokesman Nathan Aamodt said.\n\n\"And we anticipate the other phases to be in that same ballpark,\" Aamodt said. That could put the overall cost somewhere in the area of $20 million for the facility.\n\nCity construction permitting documents refer to the site as Sanford Health Amber Valley, though Jarvis said it has not been officially named.\n\nSanford already has laboratory facilities on the north side of the building. The 30,000-square-foot Sanford Laboratories Amber Valley opened at 4820 23rd Ave. S. in March 2021.\n\nIn the first phase of Sanford's latest consolidation, a new outpatient clinic and research facility will go into the first and second floors of 4840 23rd Ave. S., with more than 24,000 square feet of the first floor and 23,300 square feet of the second floor, as well as nearly 3,500 square feet of the basement to be remodeled (about 47,300 square feet altogether).\n\nSanford has been looking to further consolidate some of its services and locations, Jarvis said, and the move will allow the organization to be more efficient with its space and resources. The PRACS Building is also very close to the Sanford Medical Center at 5225 23rd Ave. S., and it has space to grow. A huge plus is that the site has parking to spare, Jarvis added.\n\nPhase I, which is to be completed by early 2025, will involve consolidating the family medicine and internal medicine residency clinics (now at the Sanford Broadway Medical Center in Fargo's downtown).\n\nThe residency programs, which are training programs for young doctors in their specialties, have \"outgrown their space,\" Jarvis said. The PRACS Building has a 380-seat auditorium, as well as offices for the residency doctors.\n\n\"We're excited about that, and it's going to allow us to backfill those (residency clinic) spaces over at the Broadway Clinic,\" she said.\n\n(Sanford's orthopedics residency program, and a new pediatric medicine residency program, will remain embedded in clinics throughout the metro area, Jarvis said. Cardiology and neurology residencies will also remain embedded in parent clinics.)\n\nThe other major component of Phase I will be consolidating clinical research at the site. Sanford has many patients in clinical trials, and they will be at the same site as the laboratory services.\n\nThe Center for Biobehavioral Research, now at 120 8th St. S. (by Island Park in downtown Fargo) will move there, too, during Phase II. This phase will also be education-focused, combining programs scattered around Fargo, Jarvis said.\n\nPhase II programs, which will movie into 40,000 square feet of the building, include:\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of things in the building that we're really excited about,\" Jarvis said. \"They'll be able to share simulation resources, classroom resources, things like that. ... It really makes sense for us with all of the education that we do across town.\"\n\nPhase III of the consolidation will take up another 40,000 square feet of the PRACS Building, planned for early 2026. It will include moving to the site some back office functions, corporate services, human resources, and customer-facing services (such as patient accounts), as well as the Sanford Health Plan (health insurance).\n\n\"We will be setting up a joint operations center. We'll be moving our ambulance dispatch center there. We'll be moving our security operations center\" there, too, Jarvis said.\n\nThe campus will have a micro market, central break room, and lounging area for staff,\n\n\"The campus is just perfectly suited to what we want with consolidation, efficiency, and helping us pool resources, so we're really excited about that,\" Jarvis said.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amber Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Residency (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fargo, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fargo, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanford, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sanford, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Health", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanford Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orthopedic surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Clinics_and_Practitioners", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Clinics and Practitioners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/5660650/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x3000+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F69%2F20%2F7771e0d242b0ae18e27b704e44d8%2F070624-b-ff-sanfordpracs-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722247", "eventUri": "eng-9722247", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fargo, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

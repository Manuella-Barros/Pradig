At Brooklyn Tech, Stuyvesant and Bronx Science \u2014 three of the city\u2019s nine specialized high schools \u2014 students have been tormented by peers giving Nazi salutes and accusing them of being part of a \u201cgenocide\u201d of Palestinians, while school administrators and teachers also spew pro-Palestine propaganda, according to students and evidence obtained by The Post. Last week, Stuyvesant\u2019s business manager Dina Ingram blasted out an email containing an anti-Israel protest guide from a George Soros-funded nonprofit to the entire school community \u201con behalf of Principal [Seung] Yu.\u201d The \u201cSchool\u2019s Out for Palestine toolkit\u201d encouraged students to sign up for the May 31 walkout calling for \u201can immediate ceasefire in Gaza & an end to U.S. support for Israel\u2019s genocide of Palestinian people.\u201d The eight-page guide included resources for the youngsters to \u201cprepare for & respond to backlash\u201d and noted they didn\u2019t need their school\u2019s permission to participate. An hour later, Principal Yu emailed an apology and claimed the materials were \u201cmistakenly included\u201d instead of a letter about the walkout itself. \u201cWe are deeply apologetic about this mistake,\u201d read Yu\u2019s email. \u201cI want to reiterate that we do not endorse the walkouts and protests.\u201d The Department of Education also reiterated that it was a \u201cclerical error.\u201d Jewish families at Stuyvesant were \u201cdisturbed,\u201d one parent said. \u201cThere are a lot of upset parents.\u201d Students at Brooklyn Tech said they have been subjected to antisemitism since even before Oct 7. This week, one senior recalled an ugly episode two years ago where students in her sophomore history class boo-ed and threw pennies at her while she gave a presentation on Israeli scholar Mordechai Kedar\u2019s \u201cEight State Solution.\u201d Shayna, now a 17-year-old senior, said that another student gave the Hitler salute during her speech. \u201cI was kind of afraid to go to school after that, but more than fear, I feel disappointed that this is so normalized that there are no consequences,\u201d she told The Post this week. When she reported the disgusting behavior to school administrators, Shayna claimed their response was, \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious.\u201d Antisemitism in the school has only gotten worse since Hamas\u2019 vicious attack on Israel on Oct. 7, according to Shayna and other Brooklyn Tech students. One freshman said a teacher told him \u201cShut up, you Zionist\u201d during a classroom conversation about the Israel-Hamas conflict, during which the 15-year-old was refuting a classmate\u2019s claim that \u201cIsrael kills babies.\u201d \u201cI was taken aback and I just shut up,\u201d he said of the January incident, which \u201cscared\u201d him so much that he stopped letting his Star of David necklace show. When a group of Jewish students including Shayna and the freshman confronted Brooklyn Tech principal David Newman about the rampant hate, Newman arranged for them to share their experiences during a faculty-wide meeting. But the principal forbid the students from using the words \u201cIsrael\u201d or \u201cZionism\u201d at the May 6 meeting \u2013 lest they trigger certain teachers, according to five students who were involved. \u201cIgnorance about Jewish identity, Zionism and Israel is no excuse for antisemitism directed at students and inaction among the adults in the room. The necessary response is increased education,\u201d Daniel Brooks, the lead educator of Club Z\u2019s New York chapter, said in response to the situation at Brooklyn Tech. This week, a two-page letter by pro-Palestine students posted on the walls of Bronx Science pressured the school community to join them in spewing anti-Israel rhetoric. \u201cWith disregard to the genocide occurring and the lack of attention to the suffering of millions in Palestine, the school has decided to support Israel,\u201d the letter laments. Another flier circulated by students called for Taglit Birthright Israel\u2019s headquarters on Third Avenue to be \u201cshut down\u201d during a June 15 rally. The organization provides free trips to young people with the aim of fostering Jewish connection and giving immersive Israel experiences. The hateful students wrote in a post on Instagram that the organization instead \u201caims to deepen Israeli settler colonialism.\u201d A spokesman for the DOE said the incidents are \u201cdisturbing\u201d and being looked into. \u201cStudents and staff deserve to be safe and respected in their school and we encourage students, staff, and families to report incidents expeditiously so that they can be quickly investigated, and action taken,\u201d he added.

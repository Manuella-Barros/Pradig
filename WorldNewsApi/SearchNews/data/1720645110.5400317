{"id": 231365906, "title": "Kate Middleton Breaks Silence  With Personal Letter", "text": "In a letter shared by the Irish Guards on Saturday, Kate Middleton expressed apologies for her inability to attend an annual pre-Trooping the Colour event, but said that she hoped to join them again in the near future. The letter follows news that Princess Kate, the honorary Colonel of the Army regiment, would not attend today\u2019s Colonel\u2019s Review as she recovers from cancer treatments. This is the second notable Irish Guards event Middleton will miss due to her illness, following her absence at its St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in March. Prior to the 2024 event, she\u2019d attended even before she was named to her honorary role, starting in 2012. (She missed only one St. Pat\u2019s parade, in 2016). Kate Middleton has eschewed public events since her January surgery, which was later revealed to be related to a diagnosis of an unspecified cancer. News reports earlier this year had suggested that she would make her return to public duties in time for events surrounding June 15\u2019s Trooping of the Colour, an military annual parade held in honor of the current monarch\u2019s birthday. But last month, it was announced that former military commander Lieutenant General Sir James Bucknall would step in for her role in this weekend\u2019s practice ceremony. (Yes, King Charles III\u2019s birthday isn\u2019t until November, but as noted for his first Trooping the Colour in 2023, the event is held in spring to take advantage of the preferable weather.) In a letter shared by the Irish Guards on social media, Middleton wrote, \u201cI wanted to write and let you know how proud I am of the entire Regiment ahead of the Colonel\u2019s review and Trooping of the Colour. I appreciate everyone trooping this year has been practicing for months and dedicating many hours to ensuring their uniforms and drill are immaculate.\u201d \u201cBeing your colonel remains a great honor, and I am very sorry that I\u2019m unable to take the salute at this year\u2019s Colonel\u2019s review,\u201d Middleton continued. \u201cPlease pass my apologies to the whole Regiment, however I do hope that I am able to represent you all once again very soon.\u201d \u201cPlease send my very best wishes and good luck to all involved.\u201d While Middleton\u2019s letter apologizes only for missing Saturday\u2019s review, it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll attend next weekend\u2019s main event. Sources who spoke with Vanity Fair confirmed that King Charles will attend, riding in a State Landau carriage, while Middleton\u2019s husband, Prince William, is also expected to participate. There\u2019s been some speculation that Middleton would briefly appear from the Buckingham Palace balcony, but though her health is reportedly on the upswing, she\u2019s not quite ready to return to public view. \u201cThere is no timeline, and there is certainly no hurry,\u201d a well-placed source told Vanity Fair in May. \u201cIt will be when Catherine feels ready and when she gets the green light from her medical team. But she will 100% be coming back to work, of that there is no question.\u201d", "summary": "The Irish Guards shared a letter sent by Princess Kate in which she said she hoped \u201cto represent you all once again very soon.\u201d", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/kate-middleton-letter-irish-guard", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66647c191c30a6daa034a4c0/16:9/w_2048,h_1152,c_limit/1475243397", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:42:16", "author": "Eve Batey", "authors": ["Eve Batey"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.067}

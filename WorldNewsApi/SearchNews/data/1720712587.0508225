The agony and anguish of an uncertain year were wiped away after a staggering run of three minutes and 47 seconds to finish fourth in the men\u2019s mile at the Eugene Diamond League. While world champion Josh Kerr soaked up the adulation from the Hayward Field crowd, continuing his ominous form after beating out his nemesis Jakob Ingebrigtsen for the win, his compatriot, just two seconds behind, savoured an unlikely personal best. The surprise performance confirmed Gourley\u2019s return to elite competition after an arduous and sometimes dark few months. From his first bone injury of his career, osteitis pubis, after last year\u2019s World Championships, to a sacral stress reaction in February, which can mean months of rehabilitation before returning to intense training. Gourley adopted the bike to salvage his hopes of competing at the Olympics, putting in up to 20 hours per week of cross-training. \u201cI was limited in Budapest with intense groin and adductor pain,\u201d Gourley tells The Independent ahead of this week\u2019s European Championships in Rome. \u201cI was barely able to get myself into bed. I was sharing a room with Josh [Kerr] and he was laughing at me trying to get under the covers each night because my hip and groin were so sore. \u201cI took a couple of months off, September and October, and I cycled outside a lot. It was challenging and I changed some bits about how I was running mechanically. In January I felt great, but about a week before Millrose Games in New York [11 February] I had a bit of glute pain. A few days later I went for a run and it felt even stronger. I got into a car to drive down to Phoenix. I got out after a few hours and couldn\u2019t walk anymore. I was crawling between rooms and limping around.\u201d If the physical pain was bad, Gourley was crushed by the reality of not competing in front of family and friends back home at the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow. Yet there was still time to recover before Paris. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to maintain my fitness but get aerobically stronger than ever before. I was doing a lot of volume on the bike, the elliptical, and the pool too. But all the intensity was on the bike, mostly on Zwift. I was way more motivated when racing. I hopped into two races every hard day. You can cycle more at intense levels than running, it doesn\u2019t beat your body up as much. \u201cI\u2019d go longer at the weekends, too, three to four-hour rides. The injury was far from ideal, but maybe it was a blessing in disguise. It was a tremendously challenging time. If World Indoors had not been in Glasgow I would not have been nearly as devastated.\u201d Dropped by his sponsor after the Tokyo Olympics, Gourley found a new home with Under Armour in 2022. The 29-year-old now feels mentally more resilient than ever, with the recent assistance of a sports psychologist. \u201cMisha [Botting from Sportscotland Institute of Sport] made me realise I was training and living with one set date on the calendar. It felt like everything was a blur and all I cared about was one date. But he made me realise that I had to treat every day separately, winning each day to add up to returning to a high level again. I started living and training with more intent. It was all about how I can be better than yesterday.\u201d Gourley now hopes to follow in the footsteps of compatriots Wightman and Kerr, who became world champions over the last two years by outkicking Ingebrigtsen. Their friendship, he maintains, has helped elevate them to new heights. \u201cWe are close, we\u2019ve been racing each other for a long time, especially Jake, we came up in the age groups together,\u201d Gourley adds, recalling hours spent together playing Mario Kart at major championships. \u201cJosh is a bit younger, and raced my brother quite a bit. My brother used to make fun of me for the fact that he would beat him and sometimes I\u2019d lose to him. It\u2019s unusual, though, in other countries, when you have the same people fighting for the same spots, there\u2019s tension. But there\u2019s not with us. It makes these championships more fun. The hours leading up to races, socialising away from the track, it\u2019s special to have these guys around.\u201d Before a shot at an Olympic medal or even the British trials on 29-30 June, Gourley hopes to sharpen up at the European Championships with teammate Adam Fogg. Defending champion Ingebrigtsen \u2013 who cruised to a third straight European gold in the 5,000m on Saturday evening \u2013 is the man to beat from an elite field, with Gourley hoping to safely negotiate Monday morning\u2019s heats before Wednesday night\u2019s final. \u201cI\u2019ve had their presence, the level is so high,\u201d he concludes. \u201cIt has forced us to operate at a different standard. It drives us to new standards. We\u2019re getting the most out of each other, Jake and Josh have global titles, which I don\u2019t have yet, but that\u2019s the ground I\u2019m trying to make up this year and there\u2019s belief I can do that, especially coming off the race I just had in Oregon. There\u2019s the belief I can be at that level.\u201d Watch the European Athletics Championships via the BBC\u2019s red button and the BBC Sport website", "summary": "<p><strong>Exclusive interview</strong>: The Scot competes in the men\u2019s 1,500m at the European Championships in Rome, fresh from a 3:47 mile at the Eugene Diamond League just months after a serious injury</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/neil-gourley-jakob-ingebrigtsen-european-championships-rome-b2559456.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/16/GettyImages-1462831461.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:45:55", "author": "Jack Rathborn", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.043}

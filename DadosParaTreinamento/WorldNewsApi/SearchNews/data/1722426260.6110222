{"id": 243327926, "title": "Dept of Agriculture got five animal welfare complaints about horses at abattoir site before RTE documentary", "text": "The Department of Agriculture received five complaints since 2018 regarding animal welfare at the meat plant that featured in the RT\u00c9 Investigates programme \u2018Horses: Making a Killing\u2019 earlier this month. The complaints related to property adjacent to the Shannonside Foods abattoir where horses were kept before being slaughtered, and includes the building where footage used in the documentary was secretly recorded. The department told RT\u00c9 that its staff only had jurisdiction to inspect the meat plant, and their remit did not extend to the nearby building where horses were kept before being sent to slaughter. However, the Irish Mirror has learned that veterinary inspectors from the department were sent to this site on each of the five occasions when complaints were received via its animal welfare helpline.

A veterinary inspector investigated each of the complaints and engaged with the keeper of the horses to resolve the issue, the department has confirmed. It follows an exclusive report by the Irish Mirror, which revealed that the Department of Agriculture was aware of fraudulent tampering with horse microchips as long ago as 2018, six years before the practice was highlighted by the RT\u00c9 documentary. Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Kildare North, R\u00e9ada Cronin, said it was becoming clear that the shocking practice exposed in the programme had more to do with the department\u2019s oversight of the industry rather than the actions of a rogue operator. \u201cIt stinks to high heaven on the department\u2019s part, in my opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think it\u2019s down to the department. They know they have a right to inspect all of the buildings on the premises.\u201d Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue confirmed to Ms Cronin earlier this week that a series of animal welfare complaints had been received by the department in relation to horses kept on the land beside the Shannonside Foods meat plant. She questioned why the issues highlighted in the RT\u00c9 documentary had not come to the attention of veterinary inspectors who attended the site on five occasions since 2018. The Department of Agriculture told the Irish Mirror today that there had been some misunderstanding regarding previous comments on the jurisdiction of its inspectors at the abattoir site. It said the footage of apparent animal cruelty that featured in \u2018Horses: Making a Killing\u2019 had been filmed in a building adjacent to the slaughterhouse where its inspectors maintain a permanent presence. This separate building was not subject to the specific regulations that govern slaughter plants and was not part of the department\u2019s regulatory oversight of the facility. However, that separate building and the surrounding lands are subject to general animal welfare regulations, and authorised officers of the department may access these using powers under different legislation. \u201cThe five complaints received since 2018 involving the holding adjacent to Shannonside were all investigated by the department,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cOn each occasion, a veterinary inspector visited the site, investigated the report, and engaged with the keeper to resolve the issues which had given rise to the complaint.\u201d Join the Irish Mirror\u2019s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

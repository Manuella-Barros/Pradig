The decision overturns a lower court, with the case revolving around trademark laws and public figure criticism. The court has precedence in striking down similar trademark laws on free speech grounds.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court barred on Thursday a federal trademark for the phrase \"Trump Too Small\" - an irreverent criticism of former President Donald Trump - rejecting a California lawyer's claim that the trademark denial violated his constitutional free speech rights.\n\nThe justices overturned a lower court's decision that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's rejection of Steve Elster's application to register the trademark to exclusively use it on T-shirts violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The case centered on a provision in a 1946 federal trademark law that bans the registration of any trademark that uses a living individual's name without their written consent. At issue was whether free speech protections for criticism of public figures outweigh the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's concerns over Trump's rights, as the lower court found.\n\nBiden's administration asserted that the law is a permissible condition on a government benefit and does not illegally stifle free speech because it bars registrations regardless of the viewpoint conveyed. Elster argued that allowing public figures to trademark their own positive messages while precluding registrations that criticize them verges on viewpoint discrimination. Elster applied for the trademark in 2018 to place on shirts - along with a mocking hand gesture illustration - invoking an exchange between Trump and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio during a debate among candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump earlier had insulted Rubio as \"Little Marco.\" Rubio retorted that Trump had disproportionately small hands.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands?\" Trump asked at the debate. \"If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee it.\" Elster said that \"Trump Too Small\" expressed his opinion about \"the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing.\" Trump was president when the application was made.\n\nTrump, now the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in November's U.S. election, is not personally involved in the case and has not commented on it. The trademark office rejected Elster's application. But the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with Elster, finding that the government's interest in protecting the privacy and publicity rights of public figures did not supersede Elster's right under the First Amendment to criticize them.\n\nElster's application remained on hold at the agency pending the Supreme Court's ruling. The Supreme Court in recent years has struck down two trademark laws, citing free speech concerns. It ruled in favor of Asian-American rock band The Slants in 2017 against a ban on trademarks that \"disparage,\" and in favor of artist Erik Brunetti against a prohibition on \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" trademarks in a dispute over his \"FUCT\" brand in 2019.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_figure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public figure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoint_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viewpoint discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personality rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Research", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_13_23_06_1322891.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

It is one of several cases at the court relating to former President Donald Trump. Last week, the court laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts. These cases were also related to Trump.\n\nThe Justice Department supported President Joe Biden's predecessor and presumptive opponent in the 2024 election. Government officials said the phrase \"Trump too small\" could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. Indeed, \"Trump too small\" T-shirts can already be purchased online.\n\nElster's lawyers had argued that the decision violated his free speech rights, and a federal appeals court agreed.\n\nAt arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts said that if Elster were to win, people would race to trademark \"Trump too this, Trump too that.\"\n\nTwice in the past six years, the justices have struck down provisions of federal law denying trademarks seen as scandalous or immoral in one case and disparaging in another.\n\nElster's case dealt with another measure calling for a trademark request to be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \"identifying a particular living individual\" unless the person has given \"written consent.\"\n\nThe phrase at the heart of the case is a reference to an exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then also running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \"little Marco\" but that Trump -- who says he is 6 feet and 3 inches tall -- has disproportionately small hands. \"Have you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The key issue was whether the free speech protections for criticising public figures outweigh the US Patent and Trademark Office's concerns regarding Trump's rights, as determined by a lower court of the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court justices unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the \"names clause\" provision but had differing reasons for their decision.\n\n\"Restrictions on trademarking names have a long history,\" news agency Reuters quoted a conservative Justice Clarence Thomas as writing on behalf of a majority of the justices.\n\n\"Such restrictions have historically been grounded in the notion that a person has ownership over his own name, and that he may not be excluded from using that name by another's trademark,\" Justice Clarence Thomas said.\n\nIn 2018, Elster applied for the trademark for shirts featuring an illustration of a mocking hand gesture. This design was inspired by a memorable exchange between Donald Trump and Senator Marco Rubio during a 2016 Republican presidential debate. Trump had derisively called Rubio \"Little Marco\", to which Rubio responded by implying that Trump had unusually small hands.\n\n\"Look at those hands.

At issue was whether free speech protections for criticism of public figures outweigh the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's concerns over Trump's rights, as the lower court found.\n\nBiden's administration asserted that the law is a permissible condition on a government benefit and does not illegally stifle free speech because it bars registrations regardless of the viewpoint conveyed. Elster argued that allowing public figures to trademark their own positive messages while precluding registrations that criticize them verges on viewpoint discrimination.\n\nElster applied for the trademark in 2018 to place on shirts - along with a mocking hand gesture illustration - invoking an exchange between Trump and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio during a debate among candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump earlier had insulted Rubio as \"Little Marco.\" Rubio retorted that Trump had disproportionately small hands.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands?\" Trump asked at the debate. \"If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee it.\"\n\nElster said that \"Trump Too Small\" expressed his opinion about \"the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing.\" Trump was president when the application was made.\n\nTrump, now the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in November's U.S. election, is not personally involved in the case and has not commented on it.\n\nThe trademark office rejected Elster's application. But the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with Elster, finding that the government's interest in protecting the privacy and publicity rights of public figures did not supersede Elster's right under the First Amendment to criticize them.\n\nElster's application remained on hold at the agency pending the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court in recent years has struck down two trademark laws, citing free speech concerns. It ruled in favor of Asian-American rock band The Slants in 2017 against a ban on trademarks that \"disparage,\" and in favor of artist Erik Brunetti against a prohibition on \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" trademarks in a dispute over his \"FUCT\" brand in 2019.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoint_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viewpoint discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2192479/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fc0%2F373e5d14d299aa69eab678e9486c9a%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5C0JU%3A12024-06-13T142209Z_1_LYNXMPEK5C0JU_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-TRUMP-TRADEMARK.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican presidential primary, in which the senator joked about the size of Trump's hands ahead of a debate and said, \"You know what they say about men with small hands.\"\n\nTrump shot back during the debate, stretching his hands out for the audience to see and insisting Rubio's suggestion that \"something else must be small\" was false.\n\n\"I guarantee you, there's no problem,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nA host of headlines ensued, including one from CNN that read, \"Donald Trump defends size of his penis,\" and another from Vanity Fair that said: \"Donald Trump Assures America He is Well-Endowed.\"\n\nTwo years later, attorney Steve Elster sought to register \"Trump Too Small\" as a trademark for use on T-shirts. He said in his registration request that the proposed trademark aims to \"convey that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive.\"\n\n\"The mark criticizes Trump by using a double entendre, invoking a widely publicized exchange from a 2016 Republican primary debate in which Trump commented about his anatomy, while also expressing Elster's view about 'the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing as president of the United States,'\" attorneys for Elster told the justices in court papers.\n\nFederal law bars people from registering a trademark of a name of a living person without their consent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office refused registration because the use of the name \"Trump\" would be construed by the public as a reference to the former president. The question for the Supreme Court was whether the prohibition could be squared with the First Amendment. Elster appealed to the USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which also refused registration. A federal appeals court, however, later held that the refusal violated Elster's First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, in a concurring opinion, said she agreed with the court's decision but not its reasoning. Thomas relied heavily on the nation's history and tradition with trademark law to settle the case. Barrett said it could have been dealt with based on the court's past precedent.\n\n\"The government can reasonably determine that, on the whole, protecting marks that include another living person's name without consent risks undermining the goals of trademark,\" Barrett wrote, in an opinion that was joined in part by the court's liberal wing. The bar on trademarking someone else's name, she wrote, \"is therefore constitutional, both facially and as applied\" to this case.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor similarly wrote in a concurrence joined by the court's other two liberals that she would have applied the court's First Amendment precedent to decide the case. She said she was \"reluctant\" to go down the path chosen by Thomas and her other colleagues.\n\nThe provision of federal trademark law upheld in the case, Sotomayor wrote, \"is constitutional because it is a viewpoint-neutral, reasonable limitation on a trademark's registration.\"\n\nAt oral arguments, the justices seemed inclined to side with the trademark office, with several raising doubts that Elster's free speech rights had been trampled on by the agency. Nothing stopped Elster from making or selling the T-shirts.\n\n\"The question is: Is this an infringement on speech? And the answer is no,\" Sotomayor said at one point. \"There's no limitation on him selling it. So there's no traditional infringement.\"\n\nThomas similarly posited that if Elster's \"argument is that somehow your speech is being impeded, I think it would be good to know precisely how it's being impeded or burdened.\"\n\nIn two recent cases, the court bolstered First Amendment protections when it declined to back decisions by the USPTO to deny trademark registrations based on other parts of the Lanham Act.\n\nIn 2017, the court ruled in favor of Simon Tam, an Asian-American musician and political activist who named his rock band \"The Slants\" in an attempt to take back a term that once was directed as an insult. He sought to register the name with the trademark office but was turned away on the ground that it is disparaging to \"persons of Asian descent.\"\n\nTwo years later, the justices struck down a provision of the Lanham Act that prohibited the agency from registering \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" trademarks, clearing the way for a clothing designer to apply for a trademark for a clothing line called \"FUCT.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_trademark_law", "type":

But if you call him \"too small,\" you're not allowed to trademark it.\n\nSo said the Supreme Court on Thursday in a ruling that combined First Amendment law, a long-standing trademark rule and a playground insult about the former president.\n\nThe case was brought by a California lawyer who sought a federal trademark for the exclusive right to use the phrase \"Trump too small\" on T-shirts and hats. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied his application because federal law prohibits trademarks that use the names of living people without their consent.\n\nThe lawyer, Steve Elster, contended that the prohibition violates his free speech rights.\n\nThe high court unanimously disagreed -- but the justices fell into different camps about why.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion that was joined in large part by most of his conservative colleagues and emphasized a long tradition of allowing individuals control over trademark-type protections related to their names.\n\nIn a concurrence, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that she saw less relevance to the history but ultimately concluded that the restriction passes constitutional muster. Each of the three liberal justices signed on to at least some of Barrett's concurrence.\n\nThe denial of the trademark to Elster does not prohibit him from making or selling \"Trump too small\" merchandise. Without any trademark protection for the phrase, other Trump tormentors can do so, too.\n\nThe \"Trump too small\" insult originates from an exchange of taunts between Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when the pair were rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nTrump often derided Rubio as \"Little Marco,\" and in response, during a campaign stop, Rubio called attention to the modest size of Trump's hands.\n\nThe exchange prompted Trump to defend the size of his hands during a March 2016 Fox News debate and to acknowledge the sexual overtones to Rubio's claim.\n\n\"Look at those hands! Are they small hands?\" Trump said as he raised his hands for viewers to see. \"And, he referred to my hands: 'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem -- I guarantee.\"\n\nRubio was much more conciliatory toward Trump while he served as president and in recent years. The Florida senator is now considered a potential vice presidential pick for Trump as he tries to win back the White House in November.\n\nThe high court's ruling Thursday referred to the meaning of the \"Trump too small\" phrase only in vague terms. Thomas' opinion noted that the trademark Elster sought was for use of the taunt \"accompanied by a hand gesture.\"\n\nA concurrence by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two liberal colleagues, quoted from a legal filing in which Elster said his proposed trademark was intended to \"convey that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textStart": 1885, "textEnd": 1895}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The bar on trademarking someone else's name, she wrote, \"is therefore constitutional, both facially and as applied\" to this case.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor similarly wrote in a concurrence joined by the court's other two liberals that she would have applied the court's First Amendment precedent to decide the case. She said she was \"reluctant\" to go down the path chosen by Thomas and her other colleagues.\n\nThe provision of federal trademark law upheld in the case, Sotomayor wrote, \"is constitutional because it is a viewpoint-neutral, reasonable limitation on a trademark's registration.\"\n\nAt oral arguments, the justices seemed inclined to side with the trademark office, with several raising doubts that Elster's free speech rights had been trampled on by the agency. Nothing stopped Elster from making or selling the T-shirts.\n\n\"The question is: Is this an infringement on speech? And the answer is no,\" Sotomayor said at one point. \"There's no limitation on him selling it. So there's no traditional infringement.\"\n\nThomas similarly posited that if Elster's \"argument is that somehow your speech is being impeded, I think it would be good to know precisely how it's being impeded or burdened.\"\n\nIn two recent cases, the court bolstered First Amendment protections when it declined to back decisions by the USPTO to deny trademark registrations based on other parts of the Lanham Act.\n\nIn 2017, the court ruled in favor of Simon Tam, an Asian-American musician and political activist who named his rock band \"The Slants\" in an attempt to take back a term that once was directed as an insult. He sought to register the name with the trademark office but was turned away on the ground that it is disparaging to \"persons of Asian descent.\"\n\nTwo years later, the justices struck down a provision of the Lanham Act that prohibited the agency from registering \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" trademarks, clearing the way for a clothing designer to apply for a trademark for a clothing line called \"FUCT.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It is one of several cases at the court relating to former President Donald Trump, including major cases related to the violent attack on the Capitol in 2021. Earlier this term, the court laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts. These cases were also related to Trump.\n\nThe Justice Department supported President Joe Biden's predecessor and presumptive opponent in the 2024 election. Government officials said the phrase \"Trump too small\" could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. Indeed, \"Trump too small\" T-shirts can already be purchased online.\n\nElster's lawyers had argued that the decision violated his free speech rights, and a federal appeals court agreed.\n\nAt arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts said that if Elster were to win, people would race to trademark \"Trump too this, Trump too that.\"\n\nAlthough all nine justices agreed in rejecting Elster's First Amendment claim, they used differing rationales that stretched over 53 pages of opinions.\n\nTwice in the past six years, the justices have struck down provisions of federal law denying trademarks seen as scandalous or immoral in one case and disparaging in another.\n\nElster's case dealt with another measure calling for a trademark request to be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \"identifying a particular living individual\" unless the person has given \"written consent.\"\n\nThe phrase at the heart of the case is a reference to an exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then also running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \"little Marco\" but that Trump -- who says he is 6 feet and 3 inches tall -- has disproportionately small hands. \"Have you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the court earlier this term, rather than last week, laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts.\n\nMilestone Alert!

And these name restrictions served established principles,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's opinion. \"This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment. We need look no further.\"\n\nCalifornian and Democratic activist Steve Elster attempted to trademark the phrase after a viral moment between then business mogul Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R, Fla.) in 2016 when the two were both vying for the Republican nomination for president. After Trump continually called Rubio \"Little Marco,\" the senator fought back on the campaign trail by calling Trump's hands small.\n\n\"You know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said, then pausing to wait for the crowd to laugh at the innuendo. \"You can't trust 'em!\"\n\nIn a presidential debate on March 3, 2016 in Detroit, Michigan, Trump showed off his hands to the crowd.:\n\n\"Look at those hands.

The Patent and Trademark Office then rejected the application, utilizing the Lanham Act in their decision, which states that federal law disallows trademarks that use a person's name without their consent.\n\nWhen the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the rejection, it unanimously decided that the Lanham Act was unconstitutional, and argued that it did not trump an individual's ability to criticize a government official or public figure.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision, though, argues unanimously that the Lanham Act and the \"name clause\" do not violate the First Amendment, and neither did the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in their rejection.\n\nThomas also said that the case was narrow in scope, and did not require further questioning and decisioning into trademark rights, leaving space open for further cases on the matter.\n\nEstler will still be able to sell merchandise with the phrase on it, as well as the hand gesture accompanying it, just without a trademark.\"Critically, the denial did not prevent Elster from communicating his message.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA man's attempt to trademark the phrase \"Trump too small\" has run into a wall after the Supreme Court ruled that the law protecting individuals from having their name trademarked without their consent does not violate the First Amendment.\n\nIn a unanimous decision on Thursday, Justice Clarence Thomas said the law restricting the trademarking of names reflects the \"historic rationale of identifying the source of goods\" to ensure \"customers know the source of a product.\"\n\nThe man, Steve Elster, tried to trademark \"Trump too small\" after making and selling T-shirts that bore the line and included a list of the former president's policies, which Elster believed were \"small.\"\n\nBut the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) denied the trademark, claiming it violated a portion of trademark law that prevents people from trademarking names without the person's permission. Elster disputed that decision, arguing that he should be allowed to trademark Trump's name as part of his right to criticize the government under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ultimately decided that was incorrect.\n\nThe decision was not unexpected.\n\nDuring oral arguments, which took place in November, justices appeared unmoved by Elster's lawyer's argument that refusing the trademark would stifle free speech.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned how the refusal to approve a trademark application violates the First Amendment if Elster was still permitted to print and sell the shirts.\n\n\"He can sell as many shirts with this saying and the government's not telling him he can't use the phrase, he can't sell it anywhere he wants,\" Justice Sotomayor said. \"There's no limitation on him selling it. So there's no traditional infringement.\"\n\nUnder Section 2 of the Lanham Act, a trademark can be refused if it \"consists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent\" and if it \"may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons.\"\n\nThat does not prevent an individual from making or selling a product though.\n\nElster's \"Trump too small\" shirts featured a drawing of a hand making a small gesture -- a nod to a 2016 presidential campaign moment when Florida Senator Marco Rubio joked Trump had \"small hands.\"\n\n\"You know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said at the time. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nWhen Trump responded to Rubio's joke, Elster said he took that as a \"topic for political discussion\" and began printing the shirts.\n\nThe back of the shirts features a list of Trump's \"small\" policies like LGBT+ rights, civil rights, the environment and more.\n\nVidal v Elster is a case about trademark law and the right to trademark a person's name without their consent, even if it is for political speech.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lanham Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Custom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Custom", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/01/21/Trump_Too_Small_Banner_1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

'Trump too small'", "body": "Former US president Donald Trump waves after speaking to the media during his civil fraud trial in New York in October 2023\n\nThe US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an attempt by a California man to trademark the suggestive phrase \"Trump too small.\"\n\nThe court, in a unanimous opinion, ruled that the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had correctly turned down the request to trademark the slogan about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nSteve Elster, who wanted to print T-shirts with the phrase, had claimed before the court that the PTO's rejection of his trademark application was a violation of his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court rebuffed the argument, noting that the Lanham Act prohibits registration of a trademark that includes the name of a living person without their written consent.\n\n\"Even when the trademark's message is neutral or complimentary, a person may withhold consent to avoid any association with the goods, or to prevent his name from being exploited for another's gain,\" Judge Clarence Thomas wrote.\n\nTrump, a scandal-plagued former president seeking to return to the White House in November, was not personally involved in the case.\n\nHe was convicted last month in New York of falsifying business records and has also been charged with seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe phrase \"Trump too small\" arose from a 2016 Republican presidential primary debate during which Florida Senator Marco Rubio said Trump had \"small hands.\"\n\n\"And you know what they say about guys with small hands,\" Rubio added in a sexually suggestive joke.\n\nTrump, who frequently referred to Rubio during the campaign as \"Little Marco,\" responded by saying \"I guarantee you there is no problem.\"\n\nElster's attorney had argued that the \"Trump too small\" phrase was \"political commentary\" and was meant to convey \"the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing as president of the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

It is one of several cases at the court relating to former President Donald Trump, including major cases related to the violent attack on the Capitol in 2021. Earlier this term, the court laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts. These cases were also related to Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nDeere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants Hy-Vee holds event at closing Logan Avenue store, customers still upset Proposed Cedar Falls housing development has neighbors concerned 3 Iowa U.S. House members seek $115M in earmarks UPDATE: Deere posts notice of 123 layoffs, 49 in Waterloo; global production, salaried employees cut 2024 U.S. Open long shot picks: Odds and dark horse picks for U.S. Open golf at Pinehurst College Men's Basketball: Highly-touted forward commits to UNI in class of 2025 Child injured in Cedar Falls accident My Waterloo Days brings diverse community together in one block One arrested in overnight Waterloo shooting that sent man to hospital 'The Vibe' takes over Scoopski's location, still offering ice cream Two injured in three shootings MLB Baseball: Chicago Cubs sign Cedar Falls native, former Iowa Hawkeye to minor league deal Names released in fatal motorcycle crash Waterloo native takes reins at Oklahoma City school district\n\nThe Justice Department supported President Joe Biden's predecessor and presumptive opponent in the 2024 election. Government officials said the phrase \"Trump too small\" could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. Indeed, \"Trump too small\" T-shirts can already be purchased online.\n\nElster's lawyers had argued that the decision violated his free speech rights, and a federal appeals court agreed.\n\nAt arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts said that if Elster were to win, people would race to trademark \"Trump too this, Trump too that.\"\n\nAlthough all nine justices agreed in rejecting Elster's First Amendment claim, they used differing rationales that stretched over 53 pages of opinions.\n\nTwice in the past six years, the justices have struck down provisions of federal law denying trademarks seen as scandalous or immoral in one case and disparaging in another.\n\nElster's case dealt with another measure calling for a trademark request to be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \"identifying a particular living individual\" unless the person has given \"written consent.\"\n\nThe phrase at the heart of the case is a reference to an exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then also running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \"little Marco\" but that Trump -- who says he is 6 feet and 3 inches tall -- has disproportionately small hands. \"Have you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the court earlier this term, rather than last week, laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Supreme Court says jab at Trump can't be trademarked\n\nMaureen Groppe, USA TODAY\n\nJune 13, 2024 at 4:20 PM\n\nWASHINGTON - The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an attempt to trademark the lewd phrase \"Trump too small,\" a decision that recognized the government's long history of setting boundaries on trademarks.\n\nThe government's trademark office, which denied the application, had pointed to the law that bars trademarks involving a person's name without written consent.\n\nBut a federal appeals court backed the applicant, California attorney Steve Elster, holding that the law would restrict his freedom of speech and criticism of a public official.\n\nElster wanted to sell T-shirts with the phrase he said conveys the idea that Trump's \"features\" and his policies \"are diminutive.\"\n\nThe crude joke harkens back to a personal jab against Trump during the 2016 campaign from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., then a Republican presidential rival.\n\nRubio said Trump has disproportionately small hands.\n\n\"And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said, taking a beat before adding: \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nDefending himself, Trump said he's aware of the belief that the size of a man's hands is related to another part of his anatomy.\n\n\"I guarantee you there's no problem\" on that front, he said.\n\nSupreme Court didn't probe the deeper meaning of small hands\n\nWithout getting into the suggestive meaning of the description during their October oral arguments, the justices observed that there have long been restrictions on trademarks.\n\nThose restrictions don't prevent the use of the phrase, they noted, even if it can't be trademarked to significantly limit the ability of competitors to market products with the same words.\n\nThe Biden administration defended the trademark office's decision not to protect the Trump phrase from competition.\n\nTrump was not a party in the case, Vidal v. Elster.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Supreme Court decision says Trump jab can't be trademarked", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maureen_groppe@aol.com", "name": "Maureen Groppe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zYSIrLuwAT5s3XTC9cKjEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/251c9710dfb32cf1627e78a5e39f34de", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 107}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Luke Hales/Getty Images hide caption\n\nIn yet another Trump case, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the U.S. Patent and Trademark office correctly refused to grant a trademark for the phrase \"TRUMP TOO SMALL.\" In a unanimous vote, the court said that under federal law trademarks may not be granted involving the names of living individuals, without their written consent.\n\n\"Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And these name restrictions served established principles,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's opinion. \"This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe decision was a loss for part-time Democratic activist Steve Elster, who contended that the living-person exception to the trademark law violated his right of free speech by treating speech about Trump differently from other speech that can be trademarked. The court, however, rejected that argument, noting that living individuals have some limited rights, even in the political arena, to prevent their names from being branded without their permission. The court noted that Elster can still market his \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" T-shirts, but without the trademark protection.\n\nThe phrase \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" stems from a memorable moment in the 2016 Republican presidential debates, during which Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made a crude joke about the size of Trump's hands.\n\n\"And you know what they say about guys with small hands,\" Rubio quipped.\n\nElster, an employment lawyer and progressive activist, applied to register \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" with the trademark office in 2018. The slogan appears on the front of several T-shirts that Elster sells online for $39.99, with \"Trump's package is too small\" also printed on the back. His application was rejected by the Patent and Trademark office, which concluded that Trump's written consent would be needed, as required under a 1946 law called the Lanham Act.\n\nThe decision maintains the longstanding \"living-individual rule\" under the Lanham Act, which has governed trademark registration for decades. Proponents of the law, including the International Trademark Association, argue that it harmonizes trademark law with the right of publicity and privacy, preventing unauthorized use of individuals' names in commercial contexts. Public Citizen further argues that disallowing trademark registration for politically charged phrases helps to facilitate freedom of expression by keeping such speech in the public domain, rather than granting individuals a legal right to exclude others from using the registered mark.\n\nFor most consumers, the line drawn by the court on Thursday will not make much difference. The trademark law does nothing to stop the use of a living person's name. It only bars a trademark for such products. Take, for example, the vast array of merchandise marketed on line featuring the image and sayings of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was alive. She didn't give her permission for any of that -- though she certainly enjoyed some of it. And the only consequence for those selling the merch was that their products had no trademark protection, and thus could be mimicked by competitors.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_totenberg@npr.org", "name": "Nina Totenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lanham Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personality rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Citizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Citizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+54/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fa5%2F8efc7dd147b98a2db9e872e423cc%2Fgettyimages-2155662640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

And these name restrictions served established principles,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's opinion. \"This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe decision was a loss for part-time Democratic activist Steve Elster, who contended that the living-person exception to the trademark law violated his right of free speech by treating speech about Trump differently from other speech that can be trademarked. The court, however, rejected that argument, noting that living individuals have some limited rights, even in the political arena, to prevent their names from being branded without their permission. The court noted that Elster can still market his \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" T-shirts, but without the trademark protection.\n\nThe phrase \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" stems from a memorable moment in the 2016 Republican presidential debates, during which Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., made a crude joke about the size of Trump's hands.\n\n\"And you know what they say about guys with small hands,\" Rubio quipped.\n\nElster, an employment lawyer and progressive activist, applied to register \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" with the trademark office in 2018. The slogan appears on the front of several T-shirts that Elster sells online for $39.99, with \"Trump's package is too small\" also printed on the back. His application was rejected by the Patent and Trademark office, which concluded that Trump's written consent would be needed, as required under a 1946 law called the Lanham Act.\n\nThe decision maintains the longstanding \"living-individual rule\" under the Lanham Act, which has governed trademark registration for decades. Proponents of the law, including the International Trademark Association, argue that it harmonizes trademark law with the right of publicity and privacy, preventing unauthorized use of individuals' names in commercial contexts. Public Citizen further argues that disallowing trademark registration for politically charged phrases helps to facilitate freedom of expression by keeping such speech in the public domain, rather than granting individuals a legal right to exclude others from using the registered mark.\n\nFor most consumers, the line drawn by the court on Thursday will not make much difference. The trademark law does nothing to stop the use of a living person's name. It only bars a trademark for such products. Take, for example, the vast array of merchandise marketed on line featuring the image and sayings of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was alive. She didn't give her permission for any of that -- though she certainly enjoyed some of it. And the only consequence for those selling the merch was that their products had no trademark protection, and thus could be mimicked by competitors.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lanham Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personality rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Citizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Citizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/npr_story_images/2024/06/13/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252F1a%252Fa5%252F8efc7dd147b98a2db9e872e423cc%252Fgettyimages-2155662640.jpg?itok=doamnV9v", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The ruling overturned a lower court decision that would have invalidated the requirement.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said that there was a long tradition in the country of giving individuals, including public figures, the ability to control how their name was used in commerce.\n\n\"By barring a person from using another's name, the names clause reflects the traditional rationale of ensuring that consumers make no mistake about who is responsible for a Product,\" the decision states.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the case in November, the justices noted that the man who brought the case, Steven Elster, could still sell the T-shirts, but would not be able to receive federal intellectual property protections for the \"Trump too small\" phrase.\n\nJustices had expressed concern about the impact that overturning the standard would have on public figures, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. saying he was concerned about a \"race\" to trademark information about public figures.\n\nThe Trump phrase referenced an exchange about hand size that the former president had with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., while he was a candidate at a 2016 primary debate.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Elster's application because he did not have Trump's permission as required by federal law.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with Elster, and the Biden administration asked the justices to reverse that ruling.\n\nIn addition to Thomas' opinion, three other justices filed opinions concurring with parts of what Thomas wrote that chafed at some of Thomas' emphasis on history when evaluating trademark law.\n\nIn one, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh Roberts wrote that federal trademark restrictions may still be constitutional without requiring a long history to justify them.\n\nIn another, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson in parts, wrote that the court should adopt a standard beyond looking for historical analogues for trademark rules.\n\n\"In my view, such restrictions, whether new or old, are permissible so long as they are reasonable in light of the trademark system's purpose of facilitating source identification,\" Barrett wrote.\n\nSotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote a separate opinion arguing that the justices should have decided the case on separate First Amendment grounds.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cq_roll_call@kansas.com", "name": "CQ-Roll Call", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_macagnone@kansas.com", "name": "Michael Macagnone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/c71atw/picture289245575/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fe917751-43e8-4f7e-befc-396614baed14", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Trump was not a party to the case.\n\nElster's application was rejected under a provision of federal law prohibiting the registration of marks that identify a living person without their consent.\n\n\"Elster contends that this prohibition violates his First Amendment right to free speech. We hold that it does not,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nElster's slogan references the 2016 Republican presidential debate moment in which Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made fun of Trump's hand size. The personal tit for tat came after Trump dubbed Rubio as \"Little Marco\" during the campaign.\n\n\"He referred to my hands,\" Trump said during the debate. \"'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee.\"\n\nIn paperwork filed in during his attempted registration, Elster in 2018 wrote that his mark was \"political commentary about the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing as president of the United States and the smallness of his approach to specific issues as president.\"\n\nHe ultimately brought his fight to court, winning before the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by contending the restriction violated his free speech protections under the First Amendment. The Justice Department then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nElster said in a statement he was disappointed by the outcome but would continue to sell his shirts.\n\n\"The decision was disappointing but not unexpected given the oral arguments,\" Elster said in a email after the opinion was handed down. \"Trump previously weaponized his own trademarks by intimidating other anti-Trump t-shirt sellers, so any concerns about a trademark being misused to chill political speech with empty legal threats already exists and continues unabated with this decision.\"\n\nThough all nine justices agreed the provision was constitutional, the Supreme Court's decision was fractured, with various justices joining portions of the four different opinions.\n\nMuch of the disagreement concerned whether history and tradition can establish that prohibitions like the one at hand are constitutional. Thomas's majority opinion identified a \"longstanding tradition\" of restricting the use of another's name in a trademark.\n\n\"This is wrong twice over,\" conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who only joined portions of Thomas's opinion, wrote separately.\n\n\"First, the Court's evidence, consisting of loosely related cases from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, does not establish a historical analogue for the names clause,\" Barrett continued, joined by the courts three liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan.\n\n\"Second, the court never explains why hunting for historical forebears on a restriction-by-restriction basis is the right way to analyze the constitutional question.\"\n\nThursday's decision follows two cases in which the high court went the other way and struck down neighboring provisions of federal law that similarly placed restrictions on what could be trademarked. In those cases, the justices found the provisions discriminated against speakers' viewpoints.\n\nPresident Biden's administration argued the provision at the center of the case was viewpoint-neutral, insisting the restriction doesn't need to clear the same legal hurdle as a result. Instead, the Justice Department said the provision should be treated as a condition on a government benefit, not a simple restriction on speech.\n\nThe Biden administration was backed by the International Trademark Association and consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Elster was backed by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group that focuses on college campuses, and Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.", "source": {"uri":

It is one of several cases at the court relating to former President Donald Trump, including major cases related to the violent attack on the Capitol in 2021. Earlier this term, the court laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts. These cases were also related to Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Government officials said the phrase \"Trump too small\" could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. Indeed, \"Trump too small\" T-shirts can already be purchased online.\n\nElster's lawyers had argued that the decision violated his free speech rights, and a federal appeals court agreed.\n\nAt arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts said that if Elster were to win, people would race to trademark \"Trump too this, Trump too that.\"\n\nAlthough all nine justices agreed in rejecting Elster's First Amendment claim, they used differing rationales that stretched over 53 pages of opinions.\n\nTwice in the past six years, the justices have struck down provisions of federal law denying trademarks seen as scandalous or immoral in one case and disparaging in another.\n\nElster's case dealt with another measure calling for a trademark request to be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \"identifying a particular living individual\" unless the person has given \"written consent.\"\n\nThe phrase at the heart of the case is a reference to an exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then also running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \"little Marco\" but that Trump -- who says he is 6 feet and 3 inches tall -- has disproportionately small hands. \"Have you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the court earlier this term, rather than last week, laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The ruling overturned a lower court decision that would have invalidated the requirement.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said that there was a long tradition in the country of giving individuals, including public figures, the ability to control how their name was used in commerce.\n\n\"By barring a person from using another's name, the names clause reflects the traditional rationale of ensuring that consumers make no mistake about who is responsible for a Product,\" the decision states.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the case in November, the justices noted that the man who brought the case, Steven Elster, could still sell the T-shirts, but would not be able to receive federal intellectual property protections for the \"Trump too small\" phrase.\n\nJustices had expressed concern about the impact that overturning the standard would have on public figures, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. saying he was concerned about a \"race\" to trademark information about public figures.\n\nThe Trump phrase referenced an exchange about hand size that the former president had with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., while he was a candidate at a 2016 primary debate.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Elster's application because he did not have Trump's permission as required by federal law.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with Elster, and the Biden administration asked the justices to reverse that ruling.\n\nIn addition to Thomas' opinion, three other justices filed opinions concurring with parts of what Thomas wrote that chafed at some of Thomas' emphasis on history when evaluating trademark law.\n\nIn one, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh Roberts wrote that federal trademark restrictions may still be constitutional without requiring a long history to justify them.\n\nIn another, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson in parts, wrote that the court should adopt a standard beyond looking for historical analogues for trademark rules.\n\n\"In my view, such restrictions, whether new or old, are permissible so long as they are reasonable in light of the trademark system's purpose of facilitating source identification,\" Barrett wrote.\n\nSotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote a separate opinion arguing that the justices should have decided the case on separate First Amendment grounds.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "todd_ruger@rollcall.com", "name": "Todd Ruger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/06/scotus_BC_045_120221-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649663", "eventUri": "eng-9649663", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Government officials said the phrase \"Trump too small\" could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. Indeed, \"Trump too small\" T-shirts can already be purchased online.\n\nElster's lawyers had argued that the decision violated his free speech rights, and a federal appeals court agreed.\n\nAt arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts said that if Elster were to win, people would race to trademark \"Trump too this, Trump too that.\"\n\nAlthough all nine justices agreed in rejecting Elster's First Amendment claim, they used differing rationales that stretched over 53 pages of opinions.\n\nTwice in the past six years, the justices have struck down provisions of federal law denying trademarks seen as scandalous or immoral in one case and disparaging in another.\n\nElster's case dealt with another measure calling for a trademark request to be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \"identifying a particular living individual\" unless the person has given \"written consent.\"\n\nThe phrase at the heart of the case is a reference to an exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was then also running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \"little Marco\" but that Trump -- who says he is 6 feet and 3 inches tall -- has disproportionately small hands. \"Have you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\" Rubio said. \"You can't trust them.\"\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\"Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the court earlier this term, rather than last week, laid out standards for when public officials can be sued for blocking critics from their social media accounts.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) accused Donald Trump of having small hands for his height, adding, \"You know what they say about guys with small hands.\" Days later, in a debate among the Republican candidates, Trump responded: \"He referred to my hands -- 'if they're small, something else must be small' -- I guarantee you, there's no problem.\"\n\nOne could be forgiven for assuming this was a one-off that could not possibly one day tie up the business of the nation's highest court. Unfortunately, that is not our reality.\n\nIn January 2018, California attorney Steve Elster began selling T-shirts with the phrase Trump Too Small printed above an image of a hand with a thumb and forefinger pinched close together.\n\nElster also filed paperwork with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the exclusive rights to the phrase for use on shirts.\n\nThe following month, the USPTO rejected Elster's application as a violation of Section 2(c) of the Lanham Act, which prohibits any trademark that uses \"a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual.\" The office found that the phrase Trump Too Small \"consists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual\" without that person's \"written consent to register the mark.\" (The same law also forbids the unauthorized use of \"the name, signature, or portrait of a deceased President of the United States during the life of his widow,\" potentially blocking Elster's efforts for decades.)\n\nIn an appeal, Elster claimed the logo was \"core political speech about a public figure\" that the average person would not likely think was \"sponsored by, endorsed by, or affiliated with Donald Trump.\" The office again disagreed, finding that \"neither the statute nor the case law carves out a 'First Amendment' or a 'political commentary' exception to the right of privacy and publicity.\"\n\nElster appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which decided in his favor in February 2022.\n\n\"The government does not have a privacy or publicity interest in restricting speech critical of government officials or public figures in the trademark context,\" wrote Judge Timothy Dyk for the three-judge panel, \"speech that is otherwise at the heart of the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"As applied in this case,\" Dyk concluded, the law \"involves content-based discrimination that is not justified by either a compelling or substantial government interest.\"\n\nThe USPTO appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which heard the case in November. In its application, the government asked the Court to determine once and for all whether the Lanham Act's \"living individual\" provision was \"a condition on a government benefit or a simple restriction on speech.\"\n\n\"No one doubts that political speech is 'at the heart' of what the First Amendment protects,\" the filing stated. But the law at issue \"is not a restriction on speech; it is a viewpoint-neutral condition on a government benefit\" -- that benefit being the singular right to sell and profit from a brand or logo.\n\nIn a joint amicus brief in favor of Elster, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) and the Manhattan Institute alleged that the law in question constituted \"viewpoint discrimination\": Since other parts of the law already allow the government to deny false or deceptive applications, they claim, Section 2(c) merely \"equip[s] named persons with the unilateral power to veto the registration of trademarks that they dislike.\"\n\nBut neither the liberal nor the conservative justices found Elster's case convincing. \"He can sell as many shirts with this saying\" as he wants, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted at oral arguments, \"and the government's not telling him he can't use the phrase.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, noted the \"long historical tradition\" of \"content-based restrictions,\" like the exception for living people.\n\nIn Thursday's decision, the justices reversed the Federal Circuit's decision and ruled in favor of the USPTO.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who delivered the majority opinion, agreed that the Lanham Act's \"names clause\" was content-based but held that it is viewpoint-neutral, noting in a footnote that \"the PTO has refused registration of trademarks such as 'Welcome President Biden,' 'I Stump for Trump,' and 'Obama Pajama' -- all because they contained another's name without his consent, not because of the viewpoint conveyed.\"\n\n\"The Lanham Act's names clause has deep roots in our legal tradition,\" Thomas wrote, echoing Gorsuch at oral arguments. \"This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment. We need look no further in this case.\"\n\n\"Our decision today is narrow,\" Thomas concluded. \"We do not set forth a comprehensive framework for judging whether all content-based but viewpoint-neutral trademark restrictions are constitutional. Nor do we suggest that an equivalent history and tradition is required to uphold every content-based trademark restriction.\"\n\nInstead, the Court decided simply that while Elster was free to sell T-shirts with cheeky slogans that mention Trump, he could not force the government to give him the exclusive rights to sell that shirt.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

From trumptoosmall.com\n\n(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a political activist's attempt to trademark the phrase \"Trump Too Small,\" saying the federal trademark office did not violate the First Amendment when it declined to register the mark. ... Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion for a unanimous court.\n\n\"Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And these name restrictions served established principles. This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment,\" Thomas wrote, referring to a provision of the federal trademark law at issue in the case.\n\n\"We conclude that the names clause is of a piece with a common-law tradition regarding the trademarking of names,\" he added later. \"We see no reason to disturb this longstanding tradition, which supports the restriction of the use of another's name in a trademark.\"\n\nThe dispute can be traced back to a memorable squabble between then-candidate Donald Trump and Florida GOP Sen.

We hold that it does not,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nElster's slogan references the 2016 Republican presidential debate moment in which Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made fun of Trump's hand size. The personal tit for tat came after Trump dubbed Rubio as \"Little Marco\" during the campaign.\n\n\"He referred to my hands,\" Trump said during the debate. \"'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee.\"\n\nIn paperwork filed in during his attempted registration, Elster in 2018 wrote that his mark was \"political commentary about the smallness of Donald Trump's overall approach to governing as president of the United States and the smallness of his approach to specific issues as president.\"\n\nHe ultimately brought his fight to court, winning before the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by contending the restriction violated his free speech protections under the First Amendment. The Justice Department then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThough all nine justices agreed the provision was constitutional, the Supreme Court's decision was fractured, with various justices joining portions of the four different opinions.\n\nMuch of the disagreement concerned whether history and tradition can establish that prohibitions like the one at hand are constitutional. Thomas's majority opinion identified a \"longstanding tradition\" of restricting the use of another's name in a trademark.\n\n\"This is wrong twice over,\" conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who only joined portions of Thomas's opinion, wrote separately.\n\n\"First, the Court's evidence, consisting of loosely related cases from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, does not establish a historical analogue for the names clause,\" Barrett continued, joined by liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\"Second, the court never explains why hunting for historical forebears on a restriction-by-restriction basis is the right way to analyze the constitutional question.\"\n\nThursday's decision follows two cases in which the high court went the other way and struck down neighboring provisions of federal law that similarly placed restrictions on what could be trademarked. In those cases, the justices found the provisions discriminated against speakers' viewpoints.\n\nPresident Biden's administration argued the provision at the center of the case was viewpoint-neutral, insisting the restriction doesn't need to clear the same legal hurdle as a result. Instead, the Justice Department said the provision should be treated as a condition on a government benefit, not a simple restriction on speech.\n\nThe Biden administration was backed by the International Trademark Association and consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Elster was backed by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group that focuses on college campuses, and Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.", "source": {"uri":

Elster, Steve Elster sought to trademark the phrase \"Trump too small,\" a reference to a 2016 GOP primary debate moment between Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nThe Patent and Trademark Office turned the application down, citing the \"names clause\" of the Lanham Act, which prohibits the registration of a mark \"identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.\" The PTO's internal tribunal affirmed, Elster appealed and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the decision, finding the names clause a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn a majority opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court reversed the Federal Circuit and salvaged the names clause -- maintaining the law that someone cannot trademark another person's name without their express, written consent. Notably, the entire court agreed with the ultimate conclusion in the particular case -- but sharply disagreed about the correct legal analysis used to reach the same endpoint.\n\nElster can still sell hats and T-shirts using the \"Trump too small\" phrase -- which the court explains is also \"accompanied by an illustration of a hand gesture,\" but he does not have federal registration of the trademark. Such registration would have given Elster the benefit of prima facie evidence for exclusive use in a potential lawsuit against copycat sellers. In other words, the intellectual property does not have a state-granted monopoly that can be used to sue infringers.\n\nThe fractious majority opinion -- only joined in full by Justices Sam Alito and Neil Gorsuch -- makes mention of the right to free speech but ultimately determines trademark law and First Amendment law occupy something like parallel paths that rarely intertwine.\n\nThe court decides the current case is \"the first time\" the nine justices have been asked to rule on \"the constitutionality of a content-based -- but viewpoint-neutral -- trademark restriction.\" This distinction is important because the court relatively recently began to invalidate restrictions on granting viewpoint-based trademarks -- for marks previously denied as \"immoral\" or that disparage groups of people.\n\n\"Although a content-based regulation of speech is presumptively unconstitutional as a general matter, we have not decided whether heightened scrutiny extends to a viewpoint-neutral trademark restriction,\" the majority opinion reads. \"Several features of trademark counsel against a per se rule of applying heightened scrutiny to viewpoint-neutral, but content-based trademark regulations. Most importantly, trademark rights have always coexisted with the First Amendment, despite the fact that trademark protection necessarily requires content-based distinctions.\"\n\nIn other words, the high court mostly jettisons a First Amendment analysis in favor of looking to the history and tradition of trademark law in the country -- present since the nation's founding.\n\n\"We conclude that the names clause is of a piece with a common-law tradition regarding the trademarking of names,\" the majority opinion goes on. \"We see no reason to disturb this longstanding tradition, which supports the restriction of the use of another's name in a trademark.\"\n\nBut the paean to history and tradition did not sit well at all with Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nFrom her concurrence, at length:\n\nThe Court claims that \"history and tradition\" settle the constitutionality of the names clause, rendering it unnecessary to adopt a standard for gauging whether a content-based trademark registration restriction abridges the right to free speech. That is wrong twice over. First, the Court's evidence, consisting of loosely related cases from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, does not establish a historical analogue for the names clause. Second, the Court never explains why hunting for historical forebears on a restriction-by-restriction basis is the right way to analyze the constitutional question.\n\n...\n\nThe Court does not (and could not) argue that the late 19th and early-20th century names-restriction tradition serves as evidence of the original meaning of the Free Speech Clause. Nor does it treat the history it recites as a persuasive data point. Instead, it presents tradition itself as the constitutional argument; the late-19th and early-20th century evidence is dispositive of the First Amendment issue. Yet what is the theoretical justification for using tradition that way?\n\nRelying exclusively on history and tradition may seem like a way of avoiding judge-made tests. But a rule rendering tradition dispositive is itself a judge-made test.\n\nBarrett, for her part, believes First Amendment and trademark law considerations are more akin to hopelessly intertwined. But, she argues, the analysis can -- and should -- still move forward on this track.\n\n\"Trademark protection cannot exist without content discrimination,\" the concurrence reads. \"So long as content-based registration restrictions reasonably relate to the purposes of the trademark system, they are constitutional.\"\n\nSpecifically attacking the majority's history and tradition analysis, Barrett goes on to say: \"For one thing, the record does not support the Court's conclusion. For another, I disagree with its choice to treat tradition as dispositive of the First Amendment issue.\"\n\nNor did the history and tradition approach win over Justice Sonia Sotomayor. In her own concurrence, she bashes the idea in favor of using basic trademark and First Amendment law tests in tandem.\n\nAt once, Sotomayor says a court should make sure the \"content-based scheme\" is viewpoint neutral and reasonable as well as in line with the purpose of trademark law -- \"that is, to serve as a source identifier.\" In the end, Sotomayor largely agrees with Barrett's own analysis but goes on to offer a slightly different analogy and an example about a fictional suite of baseball-related trademarks that would be disallowed under her own tests.\n\nThe fractured nature of the dispute over how to approach the issue shines through in most concurrences as well.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan joined Barrett's concurrence in full. Sotomayor, however, only joined two-and-a-half out of three sections -- rejecting a section discussing history and tradition. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also concurred with Barrett in part -- joining just two sections.\n\nSotomayor's own concurrence, on the other hand, did not get Barrett's reciprocal approval. Only Kagan and Jackson joined -- but in full.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts made up the majority opinion that found the names clause constitutional -- in a one-paragraph-long, Kavanaugh-penned concurrence where they explicitly endorse using \"the long history of restricting the use of another's name in a trademark.\"\n\nKavanaugh and Roberts, however, reject a section of the majority opinion in which Thomas criticizes Barrett and Sotomayor as a bridge too far. Barrett, in a footnote, complains that this section \"mistakenly\" misrepresents and \"ignores\" her position. Sotomayor offers similar objections in a series of footnotes.\n\nFrom the concurrence to the judgment:", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors":

Elster, a case stemming from petitioner Steve Elster wanting to register the phrase \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" for use on T-shirts and other apparel starting in 2018 without first obtaining former President Donald Trump's consent.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected his application, citing how the Lanham Act prohibits the registration of trademarks of living persons without consent.\n\nThe case reached the High Court after Elster was successful in getting the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to unanimously reverse the PTO's decision on constitutional grounds. But the Supreme Court today rejected Elster's arguments that his First Amendment rights were being violated. Oral arguments occurred on November 1.\n\n\"Elster contends that this prohibition violates his First Amendment right to free speech. We hold that it does not,\" wrote Justice Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThomas goes on to write that trademark law has always involved content-based distinctions rather than viewpoint-based distinctions, the latter of which he said does not apply in this case no matter \"whether the use of [the] name is flattering, critical or neutral.\"\n\nThe longtime justice also mentions the application of \"history and tradition\" when considering the scope of the First Amendment, harkening back to previous centuries -- writing in part: \"American commerce became more national in character, and, perhaps because of this shift, Congress enacted the first federal trademark law in 1870. Although States retained their important role, 'Congress stepped in to provide a degree of national uniformity' for trademark protection.\"\n\nBut Barrett in her concurring opinion retorted to Thomas' statements and his adherence to \"history and tradition\" in establishing the clause's constitutionality, arguing that the Court has not cleared the \"historical analogue\" bar it sets for itself and that historical counterexamples complicate the argument.\n\nShe writes in a footnote: \"Justice Thomas mistakenly suggests that I present the federal trademark register as a limited public forum. That is not my position. Rather, I view the content-based nature of the limited public forum as analogous to the trademark registration system. Moreover, by characterizing my argument as a conclusory statement that the limited public forum framework is 'apt,' Justice Thomas ignores my reasons for drawing the analogy.\"\n\nBarrett also wrote that \"loosely related\" trademark cases from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, when trademark law became more ubiquitous, do not establish a historical analogue for the names clause.\n\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her own concurring opinion, writing: \"I agree with Justice Barrett that, even if the majority's historical 'evidence were rock solid,' there is no good reason to believe that 'hunting for historical forebears on a restriction-by-restriction basis is the right way to analyze the constitutional question.'\"\n\nSotomayor also mentioned Thomas' reasoning in her own footnote.\n\n\"According to Justice Thomas, I focus primarily on cash-subsidy and union-dues cases,\" she writes. \"A closer look at this opinion and the cases that I cite will reveal that is not exactly true.\n\n\"As I mentioned in Brunetti, and both the Government and Justice Barrett assert in this case, limited public (or nonpublic) forum cases also constitute helpful analogies for arriving at the generally applicable principles that should apply to this kind of case.\"\n\nIancu v.

Elster, which held the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO's) application of Section 2(c) of the Lanham Act to reject the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL was unconstitutional.

Justice Sotomayor also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Kagan and Jackson.\n\nOral arguments in the case were held in November 2023, with most observers at the time concluding that the justices were unlikely to grant trademark applicant Steve Elster's bid to register the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL for t-shirts. Unlike the Court's recent prominent trademark decisions in Matal v. Tam and Iancu v. Brunetti, there seemed to be little controversy on the part of the justices in Vidal v. Elster over whether the First Amendment is implicated in this case.\n\nThe Court granted the petition, brought by U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Director Katherine Vidal, in June 2023. The petition asked \"whether the refusal to register a mark under Section 1052(c) violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment when the mark contains criticism of a government official or public figure.\"\n\nThe Federal Circuit in February 2022 held that \"applying section 2(c) to bar registration of [Steve] Elster's mark unconstitutionally restricts free speech in violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\nElster attempted to register the trademark TRUMP TOO SMALL for use on T-shirts, but an examiner refused the application, saying that section 2(c) bars registration of a mark that \"[c]onsists of or comprises a name . . . identifying a particular living individual\" without the individual's \"written consent.\" While Elster argued the mark was \"intended as political commentary,\" -- particularly, to \"convey[] that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive\" -- the examiner said there is no statutory or \"case law carve[] out\" for \"political commentary.\" The examiner also rejected Elster's argument that denying the application infringed his First Amendment rights, \"finding that the registration bars are not restrictions on speech, and in the alternative, that any such restriction would be permissible.\"\n\nSeparately, the examiner denied registration of the mark under section 2(a)'s false association clause, which bars registration of trademarks that \"falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead\" and further rejected a First Amendment defense in that case.\n\nOn appeal, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) consolidated the two cases and affirmed the examiner's decisions on the section 2(c) grounds alone. The Board explained that Section 2(c) has been found not to be an unconstitutional restriction on free speech because it is \"narrowly tailored to advance two compelling government interests: protecting the named individual's rights of privacy and publicity and protecting consumers against source deception.\"\n\nThe Federal Circuit in its analysis cited Matal v. Tam and Iancu v. Brunetti to bolster its view that \"a trademark represents 'private, not government, speech' entitled to some form of First Amendment protection.\" The court said that \"[e]ven though the government in the trademark area has not imposed an absolute prohibition on speech, Brunetti further established that denying trademark registration 'disfavors' the speech being regulated.\" The court further concluded that \"section 2(c) involves content-based discrimination that is not justified by either a compelling or substantial government interest.\"\n\nBut the Supreme Court today said:\n\n\"The Lanham Act's names clause has deep roots in our legal tradition. Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And, these name restrictions served established principles. This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment. We need look no further in this case.\"\n\nCiting a long history of restrictions on trademarking names, the Court explained that, while the common law has allowed for a person to obtain a trademark containing their own name (though not to the exclusion of a person with the same name), \"[w]e see no evidence that the common law afforded protection to a person seeking a trademark of another living person's name,\" wrote the Court.\n\nThe Court was, however, careful to note that its decision is narrow. \"We do not set forth a comprehensive framework for judging whether all content-based but viewpoint-neutral trademark restrictions are constitutional,\" the Court said. In the present case, the history and tradition of the names clause has established that it does not violate the First Amendment, but \"[i]n a future case, we can address the 'distinct question' whether \"a viewpoint-neutral, content-based trademark restriction\" is constitutional without \"such a historical pedigree.'\"\n\nThe opinion addressed in Part III the views of Justices Sotomayor and Barrett in their opinions concurring-in-part, calling their methodologies \"loose analogies\" that are not \"compelling in this case.\" Sotomayor's suggestion that \"heightened scrutiny does not apply to trademark registration because it is a Government initiative or benefit\" failed in the majority's view because \"Government-benefit cases are an ill fit for the names clause, and we would not graft this precedent...onto this trademark dispute.\"\n\nJustice Barrett would import the test the Court has used for a \"limited public forum,\" which says that \"the Government \"may create a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\" But the Court said \"there is reason to doubt that the federal trademark register is analogous to a limited public forum\" and \"[w]e see no need to adopt a potentially fraught analogy to resolve the names clause's constitutionality.\"\n\nJustice Kavanaugh wrote a short concurrence-in-part explaining that he joined all but Part III of the Court's opinion because, in his view, \"a viewpoint-neutral, content-based trademark restriction might well be constitutional even absent such a historical pedigree.\"", "source": {"uri": "ipwatchdog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lanham Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Patent and Trademark Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iancu_v._Brunetti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iancu v.

Unlike provisions struck by the high court in 2017 and 2019, the clause passes muster as viewpoint-neutral, the justices agreed. While it is a content-based restriction, such limits are inherent to trademark law and don't necessarily burden free speech impermissibly.\n\nBut multiple justices took issue with Justice Clarence Thomas's history-focused methodology in the majority opinion.\n\nThe decision reflects a broader rift in constitutional interpretation that reaches beyond what will likely be a limited effect on trademark jurisprudence. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's reliance on legal history and tradition rather than trademark statutes and free speech precedent.\n\nThe justices seem to be \"fighting about larger issues of judicial methodology\" and are \"relatively uninterested in the details of trademark law,\" Harvard Law professor Rebecca Tushnet said. Other attorneys and professors also said the roots of the underlying tension extend well beyond the bounds of intellectual property.\n\n\"You'll see this court rolling out similar analyses when discussing gun control, or when discussing reproductive rights,\" trademark attorney Theodore H. Davis Jr. of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP said. \"The court is reaching back into history to determine what it should do in the present.\"\n\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office rejected attorney Steve Elster's 2018 application to register \"Trump Too Small\" as a clothing trademark, citing the names clause. But the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the denial ran afoul of the First Amendment.\n\nThat ruling cited the high court's reasoning in nullifying a ban on \"disparaging\" trademarks in 2017 and a ban on \"scandalous\" and \"immoral\" marks in 2019. But the justices said Thursday the names clause attacked by Elster doesn't discriminate based on viewpoint the way those restrictions did.\n\nThe justices' paths to that conclusion varied widely. Thomas's majority opinion, all or mostly joined by Justices Samuel A. Alito, Neil Gorsuch, John Roberts, and Brett Kavanaugh, outlined the roots of the names clause predating federal law. \"A firm grounding in traditional trademark law is sufficient to justify the content-based restriction here,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nBarrett disagreed with that approach, arguing it's better to look at how the restriction fit the purpose of trademark law.\n\n\"Barrett, seemingly properly, says 'we've always done it that way' cannot be a basis for constitutional review,\" attorney Martin Schwimmer of Leason Ellis said.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined much of Barrett's concurring opinion, as well as Sotomayor's separate concurrence. Sotomayor advocated looking to trademark law and established First Amendment precedent rather than the dated history of analogous common law and faulted Thomas for basing his ruling on arguments that hadn't been presented by the parties.\n\nThe \"majority has drawn conclusive inferences from its historical evidence, all without any guidance from the litigants or the court below,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"That stark departure from settled principles of party presentation and adversarial testing in favor of in-chambers historical research by nonhistorians raises more questions than answers.\"\n\nThomas called Sotomayor's and Barrett's framing -- deciding whether a content-based, viewpoint-neutral bar is \"reasonable in light of the purpose\" of trademark law -- subjective.\n\nBut Sotomayor said picking common law anecdotes, the degree to which they're analogous, and \"how much history is enough\" likewise involves plenty of subjectivity. Referencing a 1993 concurrence by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, she said Thomas' approach \"empowers judges to pick their friends in a crowded party.\"\n\nThomas described the decision as \"narrow\" and said it doesn't set a framework to judge all content-based, viewpoint-neutral restrictions. But Davis said that disclaimer won't cabin the opinion entirely.\n\n\"It is nevertheless going to cast a very long shadow over what those frameworks should be,\" Davis said.", "source": {"uri":

Elster unanimously upheld a federal trademark law provision that bars federal registration of any trademark that \"[c]onsists of or comprises a name ... identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.\" The law doesn't bar people from using others' names as part of a trademark, but bars federal registration of such marks, which would provide trademark owners special protect against infringement. (The case involved plaintiff's attempt to register the mark \"Trump Too Small,\" but the legal issue went far beyond this mark.)\n\nThe Court unanimously agreed that this was a content-based, though viewpoint-neutral, classification. But while content-based speech restrictions are presumptively unconstitutional, the Justices agreed that this law is fine.\n\nBut the Justices sharply disagreed on the rationale for this conclusion.\n\nFirst, a bit of history that drew a majority, and that was joined by all the conservative Justices (including Justice Barrett):\n\nMost importantly, trademark rights have always coexisted with the First Amendment, despite the fact that trademark protection necessarily requires content-based distinctions. Trademark rights \"ha[ve] been long recognized by the common law and the chancery courts of England and of this country, and by the statutes of some of the States,\" and that protection continues today. As we all agree, this \"[h]istory informs the understanding that content-based distinctions are an intrinsic feature of trademarks\" [citing both the Barrett and Sotomayor concurrences]. And, for the duration of that history, the inherently content-based nature of trademark law has never been a cause for constitutional concern.\n\nOur country has recognized trademark rights since the founding. At the outset, there were few recorded decisions, and the law developed slowly. Much of early American trademark law \"was lifted essentially from that of England.\" The protection of trademarks under English law was an inherently content-based endeavor. For example, an early English law made it \"lawful to and for every Trader, Dealer and Weaver of Linen Manufacture, to weave his Name, or fix some known Mark in any Piece of Linen Manufacture by him made.\" And, a person could be liable for fraud if he sold a product under another person's mark. So, the content of the mark (whether it was the same as another person's) triggered the restriction.\n\nAlthough there was an early push for federal legislation to protect trademarks, no such law was enacted during our country's infancy. Instead, trademark law fell largely within \"the province of the States\" for the 18th and most of the 19th century. For example, Massachusetts passed a private bill incorporating a cotton corporation on the condition that it affix a label to its goods \"with the seal of the said Corporation.\" The law also prevented others from \"us[ing] a like seal or label\" by subjecting them to treble damages. To be sure, for most of our first century, most commerce was local and most consumers therefore knew the source of the goods they purchased. ...\n\nThe \"first reported American decision that may be described as a trademark case\" involved a dispute over the content of a mark -- and in particular, the use of a person's name. In Thomson v. Winchester (1837), Samuel Thomson -- who sold a medicine under the name \"Thomsonian Medicines\" -- brought suit against another Massachusetts druggist who sold an allegedly inferior product under the same name. The court held that the druggist could be liable for fraud if he passed the medicine off as that of Thomson. Ibid.\n\nIn a similar vein, the first reported trademark case in federal court revolved around a trademark's content. Justice Story, sitting as Circuit Justice, granted an injunction to prohibit a seller of spools from infringing on the plaintiff's trademark of \"Taylor's Persian Thread.\" Taylor v. Carpenter (D. Mass. 1844). Justice Story explained that, by using the trademark, the seller \"imitated ... both descriptions of spools and labels, red and black, of the plaintiffs,\" and that the principles prohibiting such infringement were at that time \"very familiar to the profession\" and not \"susceptible of any judicial doubt.\"\n\nRecorded trademark law began to take off in the last decades of the 19th century -- after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 -- and its established content-based nature continued. American commerce became more national in character, and, perhaps because of this shift, Congress enacted the first federal trademark law in 1870. Although States retained their important role, \"Congress stepped in to provide a degree of national uniformity\" for trademark protection.\n\nThis first law contained prohibitions on what could be protected as a trademark. For example, the law would not protect a trademark that contained \"merely the name of a person ... only, unaccompanied by a mark sufficient to distinguish it from the same name when used by other persons.\" It thus restricted a trademark based upon its content (i.e., whether it contained more than a name). As trademark disputes increased, courts continued to assess trademarks based on their content. [Details omitted. -EV]\n\nThen came a historical analysis that was also endorsed by a majority, but this part not include Justice Barrett:\n\nWe have acknowledged that trademark rights and restrictions can \"play well with the First Amendment.\" In this case, we do not delineate an exhaustive framework for when a content-based trademark restriction passes muster under the First Amendment. But, in evaluating a solely content-based trademark restriction, we can consider its history and tradition, as we have done before when considering the scope of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Lanham Act's names clause has deep roots in our legal tradition. Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And, these name restrictions served established principles. This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause -- a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction -- is compatible with the First Amendment. We need look no further in this case....\n\nRestrictions on trademarking names have a long history.Such restrictions have historically been grounded in the notion that a person has ownership over his own name, and that he may not be excluded from using that name by another's trademark. As the Court has explained, \"[a] man's name is his own property, and he has the same right to its use and enjoyment as he has to that of any other species of property.\" Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer (1891). It is therefore \"an elementary principle that every man is entitled to the use of his own name in his own business.\" F. Treadway, Personal Trade-Names, 6 Yale L. J. 141 (1897) (Treadway); see also A. Greeley, Foreign Patent and Trademark Laws (1899) (\"The right of any one to place his own name on goods sold by him is recognized as a natural right and cannot be interfered with\"). [More historical details omitted. -EV] ...\n\nWe conclude that a tradition of restricting the trademarking of names has coexisted with the First Amendment, and the names clause fits within that tradition. Though the particulars of the doctrine have shifted over time, the consistent through line is that a person generally had a claim only to his own name. The names clause reflects this common-law tradition by prohibiting a person from obtaining a trademark of another living person's name without consent, thereby protecting the other's reputation and goodwill.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Government cannot innovate when it comes to trademark law. A firm grounding in traditional trademark law is sufficient to justify the content-based trademark restriction before us, but we do not opine on what may be required or sufficient in other cases....\n\nAnd then Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Alito and Gorsuch, had a separate nonmajority section that rejected Justices Barrett's and Sotomayor's analyses (analyses that, as noted above, were generally joined by Justice Kagan and Jackson):\n\nOur colleagues would address the names clause with two analogies. Neither is compelling in this case. Under both analogies, the test would boil down to what a judge believes is \"reasonable in light of the purpose\" of trademark law. But, no matter the approach taken, we all agree that the names clause does not violate the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Sotomayor would pull \"strands of precedent\" together to conclude that heightened scrutiny does not apply to trademark registration because it is a Government initiative or benefit. This conclusion rests primarily upon cases in which the Government provides a cash subsidy or conditions the use of a public payroll to collect union dues. But, those cases \"occupy a special area of First Amendment case law, and they are far removed from the registration of trademarks.\" The Government benefit cases are an ill fit for the names clause, and we would not graft this precedent, which Justice Sotomayor acknowledges is not controlling, onto this trademark dispute.\n\nJustice Barrett, echoed by Justice Sotomayor, would import the test that we have used for a \"limited public forum.\" Our precedents hold that the Government \"may create a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\" Justice Barrett provides little explanation for why that approach makes sense in the trademark context -- she simply declares that the limited public forum framework \"is apt\" due to the content-based nature of trademark law. Although she attempts to cabin the analogy to the content-based nature, the limited public forum test is quite obviously about creating a forum. And, there is reason to doubt that the federal trademark register is analogous to a limited public forum. To start, unlike a speaker in a limited public forum, a markholder does not communicate with customers on the register. Rather, as the Government acknowledges, the register \"is a way of warning potential infringers that they risk liability if they use the same or confusingly similar marks.\" The Government has also previously asserted that it did not create a forum for speech by providing for the federal registration of trademarks. Without an analogous forum, it is hard to see why the test for a limited public forum should apply. We see no need to adopt a potentially fraught analogy to resolve the names clause's constitutionality.\n\nDespite the differences in methodology, both Justice Sotomayor and Justice Barrett reach the same conclusion that the names clause does not violate the First Amendment. On the bottom line, there is no dispute. Rather than adopt a reasonableness test premised upon loose analogies, however, we conclude that the names clause is grounded in a historical tradition sufficient to demonstrate that it does not run afoul of the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Barrett's concurrence began:\n\nWhile I agree with the Court that the names clause does not violate the First Amendment, I disagree with some of its reasoning. The Court claims that \"history and tradition\" settle the constitutionality of the names clause, rendering it unnecessary to adopt a standard for gauging whether a content-based trademark registration restriction abridges the right to free speech. That is wrong twice over. First, the Court's evidence, consisting of loosely related cases from the late-19th and early-20th centuries, does not establish a historical analogue for the names clause. Second, the Court never explains why hunting for historical forebears on a restriction-by-restriction basis is the right way to analyze the constitutional question.\n\nI would adopt a standard, grounded in both trademark law and First Amendment precedent, that reflects the relationship between content-based trademark registration restrictions and free speech. In my view, such restrictions, whether new or old, are permissible so long as they are reasonable in light of the trademark system's purpose of facilitating source identification.\n\nShe went on to lay out the often content-based history of trademark law, and concluded:\n\nThese content-based trademark rules have long coexisted with the Free Speech Clause, and their function is generally compatible with it. Courts have applied content-based rules not to \"suppres[s] ... ideas,\" but simply to serve trademark law's purposes. Indeed, these trademark restrictions can actually help prevent \"interfere[nce] with the marketplace of ideas,\" insofar as they ensure that a single producer cannot exclusively appropriate words or phrases in the general domain. This is not to say that the Government could not abuse content-based trademark registration restrictions -- as I explain below, such restrictions are not insulated from scrutiny. But they do not set off alarm bells signaling the likelihood that \"'official suppression of ideas is afoot.'\" Therefore, I agree with the Court that we need not treat content-based trademark registration restrictions as presumptively unconstitutional.\n\nAnd she drew the analogy to the \"limited public forum\" cases (in part of an opinion that, like the preceding parts, were joined by Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson):\n\nThe Solicitor General suggests that we draw an analogy to another area that is inherently content based: the limited public forum. When the government opens its property to speech for a particular purpose, creating a limited public forum, it necessarily must \"reserv[e the property] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.\" Content-based restrictions are \"inherent and inescapable\" in maintaining a forum for speech \"compatible with the intended purpose of the property.\" It is therefore inappropriate to view these restrictions as presumptively unconstitutional and apply strict scrutiny. Still, not every restriction is permissible. To evaluate these rules, we ask \"whether they are reasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\" This ensures that the government \"respect[s] the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\"\n\nThough I would not shoehorn the trademark registration system into the definition of a \"limited public forum,\" the Solicitor General's analogy is apt Content discrimination is \"[i]mplicit in the concept of\" the trademark registration system much like it is in a limited public forum. {Justice Thomas mistakenly suggests that I present the federal trademark register as a limited public forum. That is not my position. Rather, I view the content-based nature of the limited public forum as analogous to the trademark registration system.} ...\n\nJustice Barrett then went on, in part of her opinion joined just by Justices Kagan and Sotomayor:\n\nI cannot agree with the Court that the existence of a \"common-law tradition\" and a \"historical analogue\" is sufficient to resolve this case. Even if the Court's evidence were rock solid [and Justice Barrett argued that it was actually quite weak -EV], I still would not adopt this approach. To be sure, tradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication. For instance, the longstanding practice of the political branches can reinforce our understanding of the Constitution's original meaning. The views of preceding generations can persuade, and, in the realm of stare decisis, even bind. But tradition is not an end in itself -- and I fear that the Court uses it that way here.\n\nThe Court does not (and could not) argue that the late-19th and early-20th century names-restriction tradition serves as evidence of the original meaning of the Free Speech Clause. Nor does it treat the history it recites as a persuasive data point. Instead, it presents tradition itself as the constitutional argument; the late-19th and early-20th century evidence is dispositive of the First Amendment issue. Yet what is the theoretical justification for using tradition that way?\n\nRelying exclusively on history and tradition may seem like a way of avoiding judge-made tests. But a rule rendering tradition dispositive is itself a judge-made test. And I do not see a good reason to resolve this case using that approach rather than by adopting a generally applicable principle. (After all, there is a tradition of the latter approach too. See, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) (adopting standard for application of the Necessary and Proper Clause).) In the course of applying broadly worded text like the Free Speech Clause, courts must inevitably articulate principles to resolve individual cases. I do not think we can or should avoid doing so here. As I explained [above], the takeaway from history is that content-based trademark restrictions have long been central to trademark's purpose of facilitating source identification, and they have not posed a serious risk of censorship. This principle offers a generally applicable way to think about whether registration restrictions \"'play well with the First Amendment.'\"We should bring clarity to the law by adopting it.\n\nIn my view, the Court's laser-like focus on the history of this single restriction misses the forest for the trees. It gives secondary billing to what I think is the central point: that the names clause \"reflects trademark law's historical rationale of identifying the source of goods.\" I see no reason to proceed based on pedigree rather than principle. Besides, as the Court admits, its approach merely delays the inevitable: Eventually, the Court will encounter a restriction without a historical analogue and be forced to articulate a test for analyzing it.\n\nJustice Sotomayor offered a similar argument, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson; a brief excerpt:\n\nThis case involves a free-speech challenge to a viewpoint-neutral, content-based condition on trademark registration. In deciding how to evaluate this kind of challenge, the Court faces two options: Either look only to the history and tradition of the condition, or look to trademark law and settled First Amendment precedent. The first option, which asks whether the history of a particular trademark registration bar plays well with the First Amendment, leads this Court into uncharted territory that neither party requests. The other guides it through well-trodden terrain. I would follow the well-trodden path.\n\nIn assessing the constitutionality of the names clause and other trademark registration provisions, I would rely on this Court's tried-and-tested First Amendment precedent. This Court has held in a variety of contexts that withholding benefits for content-based, viewpoint-neutral reasons does not violate the Free Speech Clause when the applied criteria are reasonable and the scheme is necessarily content based. That is the situation here. Content discrimination is an inescapable feature of the trademark system, and federal trademark registration only confers additional benefits on trademark holders. The denial of trademark registration is therefore consistent with the First Amendment if it turns on \"reasonable, viewpoint-neutral content regulations.\" Because the names clause satisfies that test, I would uphold the constitutionality of the provision on that ground alone.\n\nThese are just excerpts; there's a lot more to the opinions, and people who are interested in First Amendment doctrine and theory should find them very interesting.

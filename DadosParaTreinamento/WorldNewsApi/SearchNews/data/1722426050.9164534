Don\u2019t fret though, there\u2019s still plenty of fun, social, summery vibes to enjoy \u2013 at least if the Mercury moving into sunny-side-up Leo (July 2) has anything to do with it. A New Moon in Cancer on July 5 will see people focusing on their home and family, but 2024\u2019s second Capricorn Full Moon on July 21 brings a greater sense of drive and determination to the professional sphere. Ahead, you\u2019ll find your star sign\u2019s tarot horoscope for the month of July 2024, with three tarot cards drawn for each sign and their meaning for you explained. Aries March 21 to April 20 Aries, you might just surprise yourself with how much you enjoy this phase (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Aries for July: Ten of Cups, Ten of Coins, Page of Coins Meaning: Home is where it counts This July is all about settling down, creating firm and secure foundations, and bedding in where you feel safe, appreciated, and most at home. Putting down roots is important. This is the first stage of major growth, because you can\u2019t rise up from a wobbly platform, right? The Ten of Cups and Coins combine to bring loyal and lasting vibes to your relationships and home life. You are nesting. It feels right. The Page of Coins shows some of this is new territory for you, and you\u2019re living and learning as you go. That\u2019s okay, so are we all! Revel in your new-found stability and domesticity. Home is where the heart is. Make your nest happy and harmonious. Feel this is the safe sanctuary you can fight for. Head here for everything you need to know about being an Aries Taurus April 21 to May 21 Well done for holding firm in your beliefs (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Taurus for July: Justice, Death, Knight of Cups Meaning: You are vindicated Justice shows you were on the right side of the street and you\u2019re about to be vindicated and rewarded. Karma was watching this all unfold and she\u2019s ready to deal out the consequences. Death shows this will kind of change everything, and you should embrace the opportunities and new energy this shift in events creates. Don\u2019t rub the losers\u2019 noses in it but do hold your head high and march on towards what\u2019s now on offer. Enjoy this moment. The Knight of Cups shows it will bring you happiness, peace, company, attention and opportunity, and you deserve it. Biting your tongue and watching an injustice play out was hard, but it\u2019s all going to come good. Patience and time are the two strongest warriors. Remember that. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Taurus Gemini May 22 to June 21 This isn\u2019t your mess to clean up (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Gemini for July: Four of Swords, Page of Swords, The Tower Meaning: Let it burn Sometimes, just letting things collapse and end is actually a massive cathartic relief. There is a situation you\u2019ve let swing on its own weight, and consequently it might become very heavy this month and collapse. Will you be surprised? Not really. It\u2019s been a long time coming in truth. The Four of Swords shows your withdrawal here, you grew tired of trying. The great thing here is that none of this is on you, it\u2019s not your doing. Your withdrawal just exposes how much you were propping it all up. The Tower shows its collapse. Something will kick it down. It\u2019s not a bad thing. It was false or fading anyway. The Page of Swords shows your ambivalence here. What\u2019s done is done. Let this go. No regrets. Everything happens for a reason, the cosmos has done you a favour and taken this mess away, so let it go. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Gemini Cancer June 22 to July 23 Try not to take things to heart (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Cancer for July: Nine of Swords, Three of Coins, Queen of Coins Meaning: Overthinking people\u2019s opinions We\u2019re all sensitive and we all worry what others think, maybe none more so (very secretly, though) than Cancer. Your hard shell covers a heightened sensitivity and worry. You have been whittling about something at work, with the \u2018unspoken fears\u2019 card Nine of Swords. And it\u2019s all gotten out of proportion. I feel like, with the Three of Coins, this is about a concern over your standing or reputation, what others think, what they might be saying, what is going on behind closed doors. You\u2019re dwelling on it. However, the Queen of Coins asks you to shake this cloud of worry away. You are thought highly of, there are no hidden conversations going on. Be confident in your skills, go for a promotion or raise or greater scope of responsibility. You\u2019re ready to go to the next level. Maybe it\u2019s the fear of change and progress that is rattling you. Don\u2019t be anxious. Embrace your growth. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Cancer Leo July 24 to August 23 Great things are coming if you just let go (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Leo for July: Ten of Swords, Page of Cups, Knight of Cups Meaning: Release toxicity Sometimes, success has a price, Sometimes, the price is a sacrifice. What needs to be let go of here is easy because, if only you could see what riches and rewards lie ahead for you if you just let go of this one toxic, draining, negative thing in your life (that, for some reason, you\u2019re reluctant to). Leo, do it. The Ten of Swords comes when we\u2019re cosmically backed into a corner and need to end something, it has nowhere else to go. It\u2019s over. So just make that overt and known. Consciously untangle yourself. Do it and I promise life will improve. The Page and Knight of Cups are awaiting in the wings to bring you fun, love, laughter, joy, success and opportunity. But they won\u2019t enter the stage while this \u2018presence\u2019 remains. So, get rid of it. No regrets. This might be related to relationships, but also roles or projects you know need to be replaced. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Leo Virgo August 24 to September 23 Temptation is in the air this July (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Virgo for July: Knight of Coins, The Lovers, King of Swords Meaning: Love triangle Unpick a complicated relationship situation, get clarity, and make some important decisions. Simplify matters. It feels like you\u2019re heading into some kind of love triangle or \u2018two\u2019s company, three\u2019s a crowd\u2019 scenario with The Lovers and two Court cards \u2013 Knight of Coins and King of Swords. This could be romantic, but it could also be a friendship or family alliance, or even a work situation. Your head and heart are saying different things, you can see both sides, you feel conflicted about where your best interests lie and who you stand with. The Knight is sensible, practical and worthy, but the King is smart, wily and shrewd. Don\u2019t make a knee-jerk decision here, observe the dynamics and let things unfold. You\u2019ll make your mind up this month and do the right thing. The guiding light here is to get clarity and simplify the situation, then it will be obvious what to do. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Virgo Libra September 24 to October 23 You know what to do, even if it is deep down inside (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) Tarot cards for Libra for July: Ten of Swords, Nine of Wands, Page of Swords Meaning: Procrastination Librans are famous for a spot of procrastination, to you it\u2019s just a necessary element of the decision-making process. But, don\u2019t stay here for too long. Indecision and conflicting desires, with the fickle Page of Swords, will lead you into a place where the opportunity you feel so unsure about will probably just magically dry up all by itself, because you took too long to decide. Don\u2019t miss out just because of overthinking it. The Ten of Swords shows there might be an ending, and the Nine of Wands shows this is nothing to dread or try to avoid. All endings are embryos of new beginnings. This decision has likely arisen because you are readying to close down a phase, journey, or chapter. Prepare to do so. Accept the shift ahead. In fact, embrace it, because it\u2019s the right time to start on a new trajectory. Don\u2019t try to cling to the current one\u2026. step off and move forwards.

A sensation of pivoting from one road to another. No regrets okay? The Five of Cups and Six of Swords have you waving farewell to things, places and people that don\u2019t really merit a spot in your future, albeit they have served you well thus far and deserve a respectful goodbye and a cosy spot in your memory. Something sad has perhaps triggered their departure but it\u2019s inevitable and serves a purpose too. Let go gracefully because great things lie ahead. Onwards and upwards. That is your mantra right now, and will help you to transition from your comfort zone to new landscape where you\u2019ll find fresh opportunity. The Queen of Wands has you feeling bold, brave and confident. You are ready to broaden your horizons and challenge yourself to go beyond your familiar scenery.

Excellent news. The Two and King of Cups see you being blessed by Cupid this month. If you\u2019re single, look out for Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) or a Virgo. If you\u2019re attached then expect things to progress to the next level, whatever that is for you both. Intimacy, connection, bonding, passion and fun are all on the menu, and your feelings will be more than reciprocated. This is a time to invest deeply into those whom you love and admire. The Hermit shows that you\u2019ll be taking things seriously, and that privacy and \u2018alone time\u2019 together is the secret ingredient to making things heat up.

Moving home? Changing location? Seeing more of the world? Getting a new vehicle? Going away on more mini jaunts or outings? If so, then the Universe agrees and is giving you the green light to progress! The Chariot and Nine of Cups bring dream-come-true magic to any intention or goal around travel or movement. Put purpose into where you go, and why, and how\u2026 and you will go far! Travel and new landscapes often stimulate new opportunity and energy too. Broaden your horizons. The Two of Wands asks you to focus, though. Snatch your daydream out of the ether and make it happen. Manifest what you fantasise about, focus on it fully, and it will unfold.

An opportunity to get the very bottom of an intriguing cover-up or secret will emerge this month, in your home/work/financial world, so pay close attention to things that don\u2019t add up \u2013 and then dig and probe and research and question! The Three of Wands shows this opening will be fleeting, and The Moon shows it all points to a mystery or illusion that has, up till now, thwarted your efforts to uncover it. The King of Coins is you being dogged, determined, thoughtful, analytical, shrewd. You can work this out. And doing so will unlock a big reveal that helps you in life. This information has remained covered up until now because it wouldn\u2019t have been useful. Unseen forces are conspiring to reveal it now, because it is useful.

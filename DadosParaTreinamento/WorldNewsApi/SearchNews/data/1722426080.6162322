{"id": 243279588, "title": "Enchanting village' less than three hours away from Birmingham that is jam-packed with history", "text": "Just over 3 hours away from Birmingham, you'll find the enchanting seaside village of Shaldon, seemingly plucked right out of a storybook. Brimming with history and tucked away on the south Devon coast, Shaldon is a gem all year round, but it truly sparkles in the summer sunshine. The village is a hotspot for beach sports, with the renowned Shaldon Regatta lighting up the summer months with thrilling rowing races along the River Teign. And if that's not quirky enough, there's even a beach pillow fight event that takes place at the end of August. POLL: Should the DWP be able to monitor benefit claimants' bank accounts?

In early August, locals adorn their boats with various themes and set sail down the River Teign, culminating in a lively band performance to round off the festivities. The village's fairytale charm is more than just an impression, as its streets seem to sing with the essence of a nursery rhyme - boasting a butcher, a baker, and not too far off, a candlestick maker. It's also the site of a historic smugglers' tunnel. Incredible West Country beach that can only be reached by tunnels - with a stunning sea pool, reports Bristol Live. Greg Allen, a seasoned skipper of the Shaldon to Teignmouth Ferry, which is a historic part of the village, shared: \"I've had people on here I've known for years, a long while. I've been doing this for about 33 years and out of those 33 years I owned the business for 10 years and there are people I've known on here for a long long while.\" While he enjoys his chats with ferry passengers, Greg has admitted it's not always smooth sailing. He shared: \"It's a love-hate relationship because we get strong tides and you get bad weather. When it's windy it's not very nice.\" The waterway service might be England's oldest continually running passenger ferry as per their site. Documents of ferry crossings date back to 1296, but its inception could be even older, potentially tracing back to the Saxon era. The ferry landing was relocated during World War II when US troops utilised the area for maintaining and readying D-Day landing crafts, thereby adding historical significance to Shaldon. Even after the Napoleonic wars, the riverboats got spectacular upgrades, notably gun ports, creating an illusion of formidable British Navy men o' war battleships. This ferry is a huge hit in the balmy summer months, ferrying thousands daily at certain times, while winters see just three or four riders. Greg disclosed that when he was at the helm of the business, up to 25 per cent of their yearly income stemmed from August alone. Even so, Shaldon doesn't lose its sparkle even in winter. The Ferry Boat Inns landlord, Matt Ford, who's also part of the water carnival committee during the summer, praised the all-year-round festivities. He enthused: \"There's always something going on in Shaldon. We're lucky people.\" He then described the village's massive bonfire night event, which draws a crowd of about 4,500 to the beach, with last year's theme being Harry Potter, featuring the burning of a large Hogwarts Express train. The village also hosts an annual three-legged race on Boxing Day, attracting roughly 500 participants who afterwards visit all the local pubs in high spirits. Matt highlighted the strong community spirit in Shaldon, mentioning how his pub plays a role in maintaining it. He explained: \"You can come in here and find a plumber, electrician or a builder or even boat builder to service your boat.\" He added that the pub is a hub for locals with deep ties to the area, saying: \"There are always loads of people like that in here and they're all people who have great attachments to the village that have lived here for quite a long time or have grown up here. Kind of like myself I suppose, we're just really passionate about where we live and what we're so lucky to have.\" Proudly, he spoke of the pub's selection of local beverages, including real ales from Dartmoor and Teignmouth Breweries, as well as ciders, rums, vodkas, gins, and more. Matt stated: \"If it's made locally and it's good quality we're likely to stock it.\" \"It works for us in respect of the fact that locals like to shop locally and try local stuff and tourists that travel down like to try stuff that's made here and we're all very proud of the stuff that's produced here.\" The Ferry Boat Inn also boasts a beautiful terrace out on the beach where they have a barbecue to serve up food on weekends. They also use the terrace as a place for live music, which Matt says has become synonymous with the pub for nearly 50 years. Another establishment known for its locally made produce is Shaldon Bakery, which serves up cakes, bread, sausage rolls, pasties and sandwiches - all made in-house. Helen Garside, who works at the bakery, spoke about the role they play in the community. She said: \"We know all the regulars now and they come in and we chat. We've got a lady across the road and she can't really get out much so we take her milk and bread over to her as well as a newspaper twice a week. There's definitely a community here.\" Lawrence Tucker, who has worked at the bakery since 2012, agreed with Helen. He said: \"We chat to all of our customers. In the mornings a lot of them come for papers every day because we do papers after the newsagents shut years ago.\" \"We took that on so they come in for their newspapers and a loaf and you get to know them very well.\" Shaldon Bakery, under its current ownership since 2009, has expanded to four locations - Teignmouth, Newton Abbot, Kingsteinton, and Shaldon. The cakes are baked in Kingsteinton before being sold in Shaldon, a change from the past when they were baked on-site, but necessary due to business growth. The bakery also offers a unique treat called 'Ugli Buns'. These tasty buns are filled with glazed cherries and raisins, topped with sugar, and make for a delightful snack while strolling through the village or along the beach. For those seeking other dining options, the Clipper Cafe in Shaldon is a popular choice. With its stunning riverside terrace and balcony, it's an ideal spot to meet friends and unwind. Owner Peter French has ambitious plans to make the cafe more eco-friendly by using produce from his own farm. He spoke about the cafe's role in the community, stating: \"From when we opened 12 years ago we found, with its central location, the cafe always felt like it could be a hub of the community.\" \"We open all year round for people to meet, socialise and enjoy the village scenery on the riverside there.\" The cafe not only serves up cream teas for evening meals but also spices up the winter months with themed nights to keep the community buzzing. From Italian evenings, courtesy of their Italian head chef, to celebrations like The Oscars and Australia Day, they even throw a Blitz-themed night. Peter is not just a cafe owner; he's also a farmer in Stokeinteignhead, where he grows crops and rears pork, beef, and sheep. In an impressive move towards sustainability, his farm supplies fresh produce directly to the cafe, which is just a mile away as the crow flies. He explained: \"We're trying to grow links between the farm and the cafe. So we have our pork, beef and lamb and we want to make it available for the menu throughout the year and different times.\" With ambitions to process meat on-site to supply his cafe and others locally, Peter is keen to adapt the farm's output to suit the cafe's menu needs. Currently, they provide eggs, sausages, and joints to the restaurant and are looking to ramp up their eco-credentials by composting food waste. Despite the challenges of quiet winters, exacerbated by the increase in second homes, Peter remains optimistic about Shaldon, which he considers an overlooked treasure. He remarked: \"There are only one or two turnings into the village and it's almost forgotten about.\" \"But the people who take the trouble to explore the narrow winding streets of Shaldon they'll get to see the gems that it hides.\"", "summary": "The coastal village of Shaldon, in south Devon, is a great place to visit all year round but it really comes alive during the summer months with beach sports and a unique water carnival", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/enchanting-village-less-three-hours-29425628", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29425625.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-1422895548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:10:00", "author": "Ellie Kendall,Jamie Brassington", "authors": ["Ellie Kendall", "Jamie Brassington"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.344}

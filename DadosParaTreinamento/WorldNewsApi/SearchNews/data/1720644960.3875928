{"id": 231343804, "title": "Niall Moran: &#039;Limerick know this Clare side are the best team they have come up against&#039;", "text": "Take the school he teaches and coaches in. Ardscoil R\u00eds might be on the North Circular Road on the northside of Limerick city but half the staff are either from Clare or living there. When the school won their first colleges All-Ireland in 2022, Moran\u2019s fellow coaches were Paul Flanagan and Cormac O\u2019Donovan, current and past senior hurlers with Clare. Nine of this year\u2019s starting Harty Cup team were from Clare, and 22 of the extended panel, including Brian Lohan\u2019s son, Cathal. When Moran himself won a colleges All-Ireland while repeating the Leaving Cert it was with St Flannan\u2019s. His own brother James was a selector to Lohan for the three seasons prior to this one, just as Alan Cunningham, a clubmate of Lohan\u2019s, is still a selector to John Kiely. At 40 Moran is still hurling a bit with his club and one of the motivations for staying on is because of who joined them at the start of the year. As well as being probably the greatest footballer Clare ever produced, Gary Brennan won four senior hurling championships for Ballyea before deciding he\u2019d enough of the commuting; in recent years he\u2019s been living in the Ahane area, home of his wife Niamh Mulcahy, a camogie All Star herself. \u201cYou have to remember in everyday life we\u2019re forever crossing paths with each other,\u201d explains Moran. \u201cWorkwise, relationship-wise, we\u2019re totally interconnected. \u201cWhen Clare won that All-Ireland in 2013, it really stung us in Limerick. We felt the door had opened and we had as good a chance as anyone to win it and that it ended up being Clare sickened us more than if it had been any other team. \u201cFast forward and it\u2019s hard for that group of Clare players to be looking at the county who is now enjoying dominance at what is their expense, and all the worse because they can\u2019t escape it. \u201cThey bring out the best in each other because they\u2019ve grown up with each other. They\u2019ve gone to school together, gone to college together. They know each other\u2019s club teams and club scene intimately. So they know first hand what the other is doing.\u201d Moran himself can see up close what and where they\u2019re both at. In 2020 Limerick won a second consecutive Munster minor hurling title, their seventh provincial final in eight years in that grade. Clare during that time had featured in just two finals, losing both. Last year Clare won the minor All-Ireland while this year they featured in their third consecutive Munster final. \u201cI\u2019ve told the story before about how roughly five years ago, some of our best sixth-year players were walking down the corridor together: Cathal O\u2019Neill and Colin Coughlan from Limerick and Colm O\u2019Meara, a Clare minor then and a senior panellist now. The Limerick fellas were bursting out of their school uniform while it was nearly hanging off Colm. \u201cThat exemplified the difference at the time between where the Limerick underage academy and the Clare academy was at. And the Clare players of that time would have realised that what they were doing was short of what the Limerick lads were doing. \u201cThis year I brought a group down to an U14 blitz in Waterford. Coming back on the bus we stopped off at Supermac\u2019s but when I was taking the orders, 11 of the hands never went up. I started laughing, \u2018God, lads, you\u2019ll have something!\u2019 But the Limerick lads said: No. We have a match tomorrow and we have a food plan and we\u2019re following it. And the Clare lads told me the same. \u201cNow, to diffuse the situation, I told them they could google the story of Usain Bolt and what he might eat the night before a big race. So they ended getting a chocolate milkshake to go with their wraps. But it showed how these two group of U14s were judging themselves off each other. \u201cAnd you can bring that to senior level. Both teams are consciously or subconsciously trying to better each other. And that is out of utter respect for the other. \u201cIn previous times we always felt that we nearly had to hate Clare to get the most out of ourselves. But with these group of players I think in years to come when lads have retired, it\u2019ll become more apparent that the respect they have for each other is off the charts. \u201cI mean, both sets of players staggered off the field after the last two Munster finals. That doesn\u2019t evoke hatred in you; that only evokes the kind of respect that you can only talk about 10 or 15 years later. And that respect manifests itself in battle. \u201cI know it\u2019s simple to say that they bring out the best in each other but it\u2019s true. They just can\u2019t openly say it because to acknowledge it would be almost a sign of weakness. But there\u2019s no doubt that Limerick know the best team they have come up against during their time has been this Clare team.\u201d The last time I sat down with Niall Moran was on the eve of a revolution. It was days before the inaugural round-robin Munster championship and Limerick\u2019s opening game against Tipperary who were just coming off contesting the league final. Moran was positive about Limerick\u2019s prospects. The team had finally escaped the purgatory that was Division 1B and in the league semi-final brought Tipp to extra time in Thurles. \u201cThe big thing Limerick have at the moment is stability,\u201d he said over that cuppa in May 2018. \u201cThe management structure is right, the players are right and there\u2019s a pool of talent there.\u201d All-Ireland success though he reckoned was still two or three years away. He had no idea that the county would go on to win that All-Ireland and contest a further 13 major finals over the following five seasons, winning them all. So what has it been like to be a Limerick hurling man since we last met? \u201cLike a dream,\u201d he says, \u201cthat you\u2019re waiting to be woken up from. You\u2019re nearly afraid to acknowledge it for fear that it stops.\u201d For him it\u2019s a triumph of John Kiely\u2019s leadership: how he and his players are merely focused on the now or the immediate next. Previous Limerick setups used to either be too giddy about the future or tended to look back in anger; in 1996, the same year Oasis released a single urging everyone to refrain from such angst, the Limerick management publicly criticised the referee\u2019s performance in the aftermath of the All-Ireland final. Kiely in contrast never attributed the 2019 defeat to Kilkenny to a poor umpiring decision or the four-week layoff. \u201cAs a Limerick hurling person, you\u2019d always question why we only won one All-Ireland between 1940 and 2018. I think there was such a desperation during those times that whenever there was any victory, there was such an outpouring of emotion; we were probably too keen to celebrate any excellence. \u201cTake the U21 teams of the early noughties [that won three consecutive All-Irelands which Moran was part of]: we were ill-equipped to handle the adulation that came with that. It was never properly managed. \u201cWhereas with John, ever since 2018 it has been constantly about improving. They\u2019ve never wallowed in their excellence or in their defeats. \u201cI don\u2019t think at any stage they\u2019ve sat back and said, \u2018We\u2019re a superb team, we\u2019re four-in-a-row champions.\u2019 Their excellence is solely about what they do next. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the same after a loss. They could have cried for months on end after losing in 2019 but they didn\u2019t. The same against Cork last month. There was no mention about whether it should have a penalty or not at the end. They just took it, knowing it\u2019d make them stronger, better. As Limerick people we\u2019ve grown 10 foot tall not in how these players have been successful but in how they\u2019ve carried their success.\u201d Okay, he knows, he knows: people will point to a particular incident when one player was going about asking did you not who he was. But that was a while ago and very much the exception. Moran thinks of Dan Morrissey from his own club. If you didn\u2019t know him you wouldn\u2019t know him, or at least all he\u2019s done. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to say that a lot of people would never have envisaged Dan as an intercounty hurler, let alone one of the greatest backs of his generation. With Dan it\u2019s just that constant thirst for knowledge. Once he made a team with the minors, his next goal was to make the seniors with the club. Even when he finished his U21 career, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have said he was a candidate for the Limerick seniors. \u201cPhysically you just need to look at the guy: how he must eat, how he must prepare. But above all it\u2019s just how likeable and down to earth he is. When he and Tom come back to the club, they just put the shoulder to the wheel. You never hear them making any big speech though at times you\u2019d be crying out for them to talk up more.\u201d So much of it for him stems from Kiely and the coaching apprenticeship that he served, like his time as a selector under John Allen. \u201cYou cannot underestimate the influence John Allen had on a generation of players and a coach like John. \u201cSomething John Allen brought to Limerick was a sense of belief that anything is possible. But even more than that what John [Allen] cultivated was the sense of person. He understood the benefit of travel, education, having a diverse range of hobbies. He saw the benefit of taking the time to get to know the player and exactly what was wrong with lads. \u201cHe had this great phrase: An Muc Ci\u00fan. The quiet or silent pig. For him that\u2019s what a winning team had to have: guys who\u2019d go about their work without any fuss. And any month or so he\u2019d give an award to someone on the panel who exemplified that. The county and the media might have been all about our freetaker who nailed 10 frees the previous day but he\u2019d highlight the contribution of No.28 on the panel. I remember in 2013 Shane O\u2019Neill from South Liberties picked up an injury early that year but remained massive in the group for the culture he represented. \u201cJohn Kiely looks for the same quality in players. Why is it that no one drops off the extended panel in Limerick, compared to say the Tyrone footballers who have had some All-Ireland success themselves? \u201cThere is no ego: it\u2019s all about what\u2019s best for the group. When Kyle Hayes, who\u2019d won All Stars as a half-forward, was asked to go back into the halfback line, he didn\u2019t throw his toys out of the pram: he just did what the team was asked. The same with Will O\u2019Donoghue going to centre back in last year\u2019s All-Ireland semi-final. An Muc Ci\u00fan.\u201d You ask him is Limerick as a county capitalising on this golden age. If the structures that helped cultivate this special generation are still in place or have even been improved. He\u2019d love to say that they have but couldn\u2019t with any certainty. \u201cLimerick is a very transient sporting county. If you back to the late 70s local soccer was king. Rugby has had its periods, as has hurling. So history does have a habit of repeating itself. \u201cIf we are to remain the real hurling county that we\u2019d consider ourselves to be, you\u2019d be looking to at least win an All-Ireland every decade and compete in at least a couple of finals. Will we? \u201cRecent history has shown us that even in counties who are traditionally more successful than Limerick the weeds don\u2019t be long growing under your feet. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve to ask ourselves is our school system strong enough? Is our academy system? Have we grown hurling in places like Newcastlewest or west Limerick in general? \u201cIf you look at the example of John Kiely and his team, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve striven for excellence and to get better day by day. And I think the rest of us as Limerick people could all take our lead from them.\u201d For now he\u2019ll cherish a week like this, knowing the team cherish what they have. Moran has spoken before how it was only late in his career that he learned to play with freedom. Not these guys. \u201cWhat cannot be said enough about John and the likes of Caroline Currid is that they have cultivated such a happy place. And that happy place is not dictated by results. Winning is just an unbelievable byproduct of what they\u2019re doing and have. They\u2019re not just playing. They\u2019re living. \u201cIf you ask most elite sports people what\u2019s the biggest regret they have when they\u2019ve finished up, it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t enjoy it enough. You always felt under pressure to perform. You always felt that you had to be something to justify yourself to others. With this Limerick panel they don\u2019t have to justify themselves to anyone.\u201d These are the days of their lives \u2013 and their county\u2019s.", "summary": "Everywhere he looks they\u2019re there, just as everywhere a Clare person looks they\u2019ll invariably see someone from Limerick and be reminded of the current hurling hierarchy", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/arid-41411666.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8303/4151573_14_seoimage1x1_2794511.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:37:00", "author": "Irishexaminer.com,Kieran Shannon", "authors": ["Irishexaminer.com", "Kieran Shannon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.137}

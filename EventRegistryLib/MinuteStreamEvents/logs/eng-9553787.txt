It also was featured on TV shows like \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"\n\nNealy says he didn't find out his former collaborator had inked a deal with a record company that allowed the sampling until 2016. He sued two years later for damages going back to the song's release.\n\nCopyright law says suits must be filed within three years of the violation, or the point when it's discovered. The record company, Warner Chappell, argued that means Nealy would only be entitled to three years' worth of royalties at most.\n\nThe question of how far back damages can go has split appeals courts, and it's one that industry groups like the Recording Industry Association of America called on the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nThe opinion handed down Thursday was written by Justice Elena Kagan, and joined by her liberal colleagues Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson as well as conservative justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nFILE - Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, April 25, 2024.

It also was featured on TV shows like \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"\n\nNealy says he didn't find out his former collaborator had inked a deal with a record company that allowed the sampling until 2016. He sued two years later for damages going back to the song's release.\n\nCopyright law says suits must be filed within three years of the violation, or the point when it's discovered. The record company, Warner Chappell, argued that means Nealy would only be entitled to three years' worth of royalties at most.\n\nThe question of how far back damages can go has split appeals courts, and it's one that industry groups like the Recording Industry Association of America called on the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nThe opinion handed down Thursday was written by Justice Elena Kagan, and joined by her liberal colleagues Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson as well as conservative justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n\"There is no time limit on monetary recovery.

The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Nealy could sue for damages as far back as 2008 despite a three-year statute of limitations in copyright law, and on Thursday, the Supreme Court agreed.\n\nSome federal courts have allowed copyright plaintiffs to start the clock on that three-year window at the point they become aware of the alleged infringement, rather than when it is alleged to have occurred. Because of his prison sentences, Nealy said he didn't discover the use of the music until around 2016.\n\nThe issue for the Supreme Court was how far back a plaintiff may seek for damages.

The 6-3 ruling, written by Justice Elena Kagan, determined that there is no time limit for recovering monetary damages in copyright cases that have been filed before the expiration of a statute of limitations. This decision affirmed a lower court ruling that favored Nealy, who had sued Warner subsidiary Warner Chappell Music and others in 2018.\n\nNealy, who owns the Music Specialist label, argued that he held the rights to the electronic dance song \"Jam the Box\" by Tony Butler, also known as Pretty Tony. According to Nealy, rapper Flo Rida, whose real name is Tramar Dillard, incorporated elements of \"Jam the Box\" into his 2008 hit song \"In the Ayer\" without proper authorization. Nealy filed a lawsuit seeking damages dating back to 2008, but a federal judge initially limited the damages to infringement that occurred within three years of the lawsuit filing, based on the statute of limitations.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\nBroader Scope for Damages:\n\n-The decision expands the potential timeframe for copyright owners to recover damages in infringement cases, potentially impacting the financial exposure of music labels and other rights holders.\n\nUncertainty for \"Discovery Rule\":\n\n-The Supreme Court's consideration of a separate copyright case involving the \"discovery rule\" might influence future interpretations of timeliness in such lawsuits.\n\nPotential Impact on Future Litigation:\n\n-The ruling could lead to an increase in copyright infringement lawsuits with broader damage claims, prompting adjustments in legal strategies for rights holders and creators.\n\nKey Points:\n\n-The Court's 6-3 decision allows Miami producer Sherman Nealy to seek full damages for alleged infringement of his song \"Jam the Box\" by Warner Music, even though the infringement began in 2008 and the lawsuit was filed in 2018.\n\n-The previous limit based on the three-year statute of limitations for filing copyright infringement claims has been removed for timely lawsuits.\n\n-Justice Kagan's majority opinion emphasizes that the Copyright Act allows recovery of damages for any timely claim, regardless of when the infringement occurred.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n-The music industry will likely adapt legal strategies in response to the broader scope for copyright damages.\n\n-The Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the \"discovery rule\" could further clarify the timeliness of copyright infringement claims.\n\n-This case sets a precedent for copyright owners to pursue potentially larger settlements or judgments in future infringement lawsuits.\n\nHowever, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, finding \"no bar to damages in a timely action.\" The Supreme Court upheld the 11th Circuit's ruling, with Kagan emphasizing that \"the Copyright Act entitles a copyright owner to recover damages for any timely claim.\" Nealy may now pursue damages for alleged infringement dating back to 2008.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, expressed concern about the potential implications of the ruling, noting that the court may need to reconsider the statute of limitations issue in a separate dispute between Hearst Newspapers and photographer Antonio Martinelli. Despite these reservations, the ruling marks a significant victory for Nealy and establishes a precedent that could influence future copyright infringement cases.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Butler_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Butler (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flo_Rida", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flo Rida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Ayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In the Ayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Chappell_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Chappell Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearst Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright Act of 1976"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenting_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissenting opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Warner_Music_Group_%281%29.jpg/640px-Warner_Music_Group_%281%29.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553787", "eventUri": "eng-9553787", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court sided with a music producer in a copyright case Thursday, allowing him to seek more than a decade's worth of damages over a sample used in a hit Flo Rida song. The 6-3 decision came in a case filed by Sherman Nealy, who was suing over music used in the 2008 song \"In the Ayer,\"\u009d by the rapper Flo Rida. It also was featured on TV shows like \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"\u009d Nealy says he didn't find out his former collaborator had inked a deal with a record company that allowed the sampling until 2016. He sued two years later for damages going back to the song's release. Copyright law says suits must be filed within three years of the violation, or the point when it's discovered. The record company, Warner Chappell, argued that means Nealy would only be entitled to three years' worth of royalties at most. The question of how far back damages can go has split appeals courts, and it's one that industry groups like the Recording Industry Association of America called on the Supreme Court to decide. The opinion handed down Thursday was written by Justice Elena Kagan, and joined by her liberal colleagues Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson as well as conservative justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. \"There is no time limit on monetary recovery. So a copyright owner possessing a timely claim is entitled to damages for infringement, no matter when the infringement occurred,\"\u009d Kagan wrote. Three conservative justices dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the majority sidestepped the important question: Whether Nealy's claim was valid to begin with, or whether copyright holders should have to show some kind of fraud in order to sue over older violations. The dissenters said the suit should have been dismissed.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flo_Rida", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flo Rida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Ayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In the Ayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You_Think_You_Can_Dance_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "So You Think You Can Dance (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240425100420-662a675e6013bbf0db2da824jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553787", "eventUri": "eng-9553787", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Or can owners like Nealy seek damages ranging back decades, adding potentially many more millions to the total?\n\nIn Thursday's ruling, the justices said it was the latter, affirming a lower appeals court that had rejected the three-year cap. \"There is no time limit on monetary recovery,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her brief opinion. \"So a copyright owner possessing a timely claim for infringement is entitled to damages, no matter when the infringement occurred.\"\n\nThough it dealt with esoteric questions of copyright law, Nealy's case was closely-watched by the music industry, which has seen a large increase in decades-delayed copyright lawsuits over the past decade, targeting Led Zeppelin, U2, Meatloaf and many others. Thursday's ruling, which creates a far larger potential prize in such cases, could encourage even more accusers to try their hand at litigation.\n\nCrucially, however, the ruling sidestepped questions that could have created an even bigger impact. In her opinion, Kagan explicitly noted that she was not deciding an even-more-important issue: Whether someone like Nealy could file a lawsuit in the first place many years after his song was first infringed.\n\nThat question, which has divided lower courts in dueling camps with two different approaches, will need to be resolved in a future case. In Thursday's decision, Kagan simply said that, assuming that such years-delayed cases can indeed be filed, then there should be no cap on how far back an accuser can seek to recover money.\n\n\"We do not resolve today which of those two rules should govern a copyright claim's timeliness,\" the justice wrote, referring to the split over the issue. \"But we reject applying a judicially invented damages limit to convert one of them into the other.\"\n\nNeither side immediately returned requests for comment on the decision.\n\nNealy sued Atlantic Records, Warner Chappell and Artist Publishing Group in Florida federal court in 2018, arguing he had never actually granted them a valid license for his \"Jam the Box\" to be sampled in Flo Rida's \"In the Ayer,\" which reached No. 9 on the Hot 100 after being released in July 2008.\n\nIn 2021, the judge overseeing ruled that Nealy couldn't win any money from earlier than 2015, citing the three-year cap on damages. He cited a 2014 Supreme Court ruling on the movie Raging Bull, which seemed to impose that limit by saying that copyright accusers can \"gain retrospective relief running only three years back.\"\n\nBut earlier this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit overturned that ruling and said he could seek damages going back to the release of Flo Rida's track. Adopting a so-called \"discovery rule\" approach used by certain other courts, the appeals court cited the fact that Nealy claimed he had only learned of the illegal sample in 2016.\n\nWarner quickly appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, warning that the \"discovery\" approach would unfairly expand the \"financial exposure\" of a copyright defendant and potentially lead to frivolous lawsuits that aimed to \"extract settlements.\"\n\n\"Deprived of a predictable limitations period and faced with expensive, time-consuming, and difficult litigation in order to defend years-old uses of copyrighted works, defendants will often be left with no choice but to settle claims early even in the absence of wrongdoing -- or potentially never enter valuable agreements in the first place,\" Warner wrote.\n\nAhead of Thursday's ruling, labels and publishers were watching Warner's case closely. In a brief filed last year, the Recording Industry Association of America and National Music Publishers' Association called the case \"vitally important to the music industry.\"\n\n\"Because copyrights are the music industry's most consequential asset, music labels and music publishers regularly find themselves both enforcing and defending copy right lawsuits,\" lawyers for RIAA and NMPA wrote. \"Without a clear national rule setting the temporal limits of recoverable damages, amici and their members face serious uncertainty.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news",

But those provisions likewise do not aid a long-ago infringer. They state without qualification that an infringer is liable either for statutory damages or for the owner's actual damages and the infringer's profits. There is no time limit on monetary recovery. So a copyright owner possessing a timely claim for infringement is entitled to damages, no matter when the infringement occurred.\"\n\nThe parties in the case did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJustice Kagan was joined by Justice John Roberts, an appointee of former President George W. Bush; Sonia Sotomayor, another appointee of President Obama; and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, appointees of President Trump.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, appointed by President Trump, said in a dissent that the majority, in addressing what's known as the discovery rule, should have addressed whether the act \"has room for such a rule.\"\n\nHe said he would have rejected the case and waited until another that cleanly presented whether the act authorizes the discovery rule.\n\n\"The act almost certainly does not tolerate a discovery rule. And that fact promises soon enough to make anything we might say today about the rule's operational details a dead letter,\" he wrote.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, an appointee of former President George H.

Nealy, a case that asks whether a copyright plaintiff can recover damages for acts that allegedly occurred more than three years before the filing of a lawsuit.\n\nThe Justices ruled 6-3 that \"the Copyright Act entitles a copyright owner to recover damages for any timely claim,\" with no limit preventing recovery for infringement that happened beyond three years. As to the issue of when a claim for infringement \"accrues,\" the Court said it \"assumes without deciding\" that accrual occurs upon discovery of the infringement.\n\nThe case stems from a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision in February 2023 that held that the discovery accrual rule allows plaintiffs to collect retrospective relief for infringements occurring outside of the Copyright Act's three-year limit against civil actions for infringement claims, codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(b). The appellate court found that the plain language of Section 507, which requires that an action commence \"within three years after the claim accrued,\" does not impose a limitation on recovery for claims that are timely under the discovery accrual rule.\n\nWarner Chappell petitioned the Supreme Court in September 2023 and argued that the Eleventh Circuit's decision deepened a circuit split on the application of the discovery accrual rule to Section 507(b). The rule tolls the statute of limitations until the date that the plaintiff copyright owner could have reasonably discovered the infringement with due diligence. While the Eleventh Circuit joined the Ninth Circuit in determining that the three-year recovery period begins from the date of the claim's accrual, the Second Circuit has ruled in cases like Sohm v. Scholastic (2020) that recovery begins from the date that the lawsuit was filed, even when the discovery rule tolls the statute.\n\nMore than a dozen amici weighed in, including the U.S. Solicitor General, who participated in the February oral arguments. The Solicitor General backed Nealy and urged the Court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of the High Court's ruling in Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (2013) over competing interpretations in the Second Circuit. Petrella is at the heart of the circuit split on the discovery accrual rule and focused on the application of equitable laches to claims filed within the Copyright Act's statute of limitations. Since Petrella, circuit courts have been left to interpret whether Petrella's holding requires strict adherence to the three-year limitation on recovery in cases where the discovery accrual rule applies.\n\nThe Court in today's decision explained that its decision in Petrella does not support a three-year damages cap. The opinion explained:\n\n\"There, the Court noted that the Copyright Act's statute of limitations allows plaintiffs \"to gain retrospective relief running only three years back from\" the filing of a suit.... Taken out of context, that line might seem to address the issue here. But that statement merely described how the limitations provision worked in Petrella, where the plaintiff had long known of the defendant's infringing conduct and so could not avail herself of the discovery rule to sue for infringing acts more than three years old. The Court did not go beyond the case's facts to say that even if the limitations provision allows a claim for an earlier infringement, the plaintiff may not obtain monetary relief.\"\n\nThe Court also said that it chose not to decide \"whether a copyright claim accrues when a plaintiff discovers or should have discovered an infringement, rather than when the infringement happened\" because the issue was not properly presented in the case, since Warner Chappell did not challenge the Eleventh Circuit's use of the discovery rule.\n\nThe dissent -- authored by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Justices Thomas and Alito -- criticized the majority's approach and countered that \"the Act almost certainly does not tolerate a discovery rule.\" While the dissent conceded that it is understandable that the Court left the question for another case considering the parties did not question whether a discovery rule exists, \"if that is a permissible course, it does not strike me as the most sensible one,\" Justice Gorsuch wrote. He concluded by saying that he would have dismissed the case as improvidently granted and waited for a better one where the issues were squarely presented. \"Better, in my view, to answer a question that does matter than one that almost certainly does not.\"\n\nCommenting on the decision today, Knobbe Martens partner Jeff Van Hoosear called it \"a victory for copyright owners, and in particular individuals and small entities that own copyrights.\" Van Hoosear added:", "source": {"uri": "ipwatchdog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copyright Act of 1976"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laches_(equity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laches (equity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/copyright-gavel-Depositphotos_118290464_xl-2015copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553787", "eventUri": "eng-9553787", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

In some cases, claimants could potentially get a bigger payout by waiting to sue and letting damages stack rather than trying to stop the alleged infringement as long as they bring a lawsuit within the statute of limitations.\n\n\"There is no time limit on monetary recovery,\" wrote justice Elena Kagan in the majority opinion. \"So a copyright owner possessing a timely claim for infringement is entitled to damages, no matter when the infringement occurred.\"\n\nThe case revolves around the 1984 song \"Jam the Box,\" which Sherman Nealy's Miami record label Music Specialist owns and was sampled in 2008 by Flo Rida. At the time, however, Nealy was incarcerated and didn't know about the use. In 2018, he sued Atlantic Records, Warner Chappell and Artists Publishing Group, arguing that he didn't authorize the use of his label's music and that his former business partner didn't have permission to grant licenses. Nealy sought damages going back a decade, which Warner Chappell opposed on grounds that he could only get damages for infringement since 2015. Appeals followed.\n\nCourts have clashed on how far back damages can be recovered. With clarity from the Supreme Court that they aren't limited by a lookback period, intellectual property lawyer Paul Schoenhard says the decision \"increases the risk of copyright infringement damages exposure for many folks in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nHe stresses, \"That can mean real money for people.\"\n\nJeff Van Hoosear, another intellectual property lawyer, calls the ruling a \"victory for copyright owners,\" particularly \"individuals and small entities.\" Trademark attorney Zachary Al-Tabbaa says a \"surge of copyright infringement lawsuits looms, some reaching back decades\" as long as they timely sued.\n\nThursday's ruling could also disincentivize copyright holders to find acts of infringement early, especially in instances in which the alleged infringer's work is more popular and profitable than the work they infringed upon. One example is a 2015 judgment against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams in favor of Marvin Gaye's family over \"Blurred Lines.\" Since the Copyright Act allows for disgorgement of profits, the plaintiffs in that case could've gotten a bigger payout had they waited to sue.\n\n\"This incentivizes parties not to be fully informed,\" Schoenhard says. \"Why would you ever want to wait? There may be acts of copyright infringement that would be discontinued upon filing of a lawsuit such that delay in bringing a lawsuit could permit accrual of additional damages beyond what otherwise might exist.\"\n\nIn agreeing to review the case, the Supreme Court was primed to settle a copyright issue that has long divided federal appeals courts. Under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff must file suit \"within three years after the claim accrued.\" One camp has interpreted that language to mean that the window to sue starts when the infringement occurs under the so-called injury rule, while another has interpreted it to mean that the window to sue starts when the infringement is discovered under the so-called discovery rule. Endorsement of the latter would enable plaintiffs to bring claims over old infringements as long as they learned of them within three years prior to suing.\n\nOn summary judgment, the music publishers argued that Nealy didn't sue within the three-year window to file a lawsuit for copyright infringement. The federal judge overseeing the case agreed, but his decision was reversed by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It found that the three-year statute of limitations doesn't begin until the copyright owner \"knows or has reason to know [they] were injured.\" The finding endorsed application of the discovery rule under the Copyright Act opposed to the injury rule, which holds that the statute of limitations starts to run when the infringement occurs, regardless of plaintiffs' knowledge.\n\nMuch to the frustration of copyright lawyers, the court didn't settle the issue. The majority concluded that the question of whether the discovery rule is applicable under copyright law wasn't before them because Warner Chappell never challenged the application of the discovery rule.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented. If the court had ruled on the validity of the discovery rule, Thomas said the Copyright Act \"almost certainly does not tolerate\" it.\"\n\nWith interpretation of the Copyright Act's language remaining unresolved, claimants could be encouraged to bring claims in certain courts. The 8th and 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals remain the only courts that haven't expressly endorsed application of the discovery rule, though the lower courts under their purview have applied the doctrine.\n\nThe ruling also reinforces the significance of securing licenses since the court clarified that there's open-ended copyright infringement liability.\n\n\"Clients must be advised not to utilize copyrighted material in their business activities unless they are absolutely certain they have the rights to do so,\" Al-Tabbaa says. \"Otherwise, the liability may persist indefinitely if discovered later and a suit is timely filed.\"\n\nThe case will be remanded back to federal court. One issue that may come up is whether Nealy could've reasonably discovered the infringement while he was in prison. If so, the court may find that he's barred from suing under the statute of limitations.\n\n\"We are pleased with the Supreme Court's decision to rule in Mr. Nealy's favor,\" said Wes Earnhardt, who represented Nealy. \"By holding that damages are available for all timely filed infringement claims, regardless of when the infringements occurred, the Court's decision provides clarity on an important issue that had divided the Circuit Courts.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Satyadev chose not to appear for his second language examination, and went on to score an A grade.\n\nSo, the Vijayawada teenager's inter (+2) marks memo showed five subjects which also included the exempted second language. But, the BIE has been marking an 'E' (Exemption) in place of marks against the second language column in the final certificate.\n\nSatyadev was allocated a seat in IIT Chennai in Round 1 of Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JOSSA) counselling. For admission, he was asked to upload his Intermediate Memorandum of Marks for verification. The JOSSA counselling is for admission into IITs, NITs, IIEST, IIITs and GFTIs.\n\nSatyadev was in a shock when the IIT-Madras document verification department informed him that his memo showed marks in only four subjects, and that they considered Maths A and Maths B as one subject. He was, thus, deemed unqualified for a seat.\n\nWhen Satyadev pleaded with the IIT authorities, they advised him to approach BIE and get specific marks mentioned instead of 'E' in order to gain admission. Several other such students also did the same.\n\nExemptions in language and reduction in pass percentage of marks for CwSN (Children with Special Needs) students are implemented under a government order (G.O.) of March 2022. The CwSN candidates are exempted from passing in Part-I (English) or Part-II (Second Languages such as Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit etc.) as per their choice.\n\nIt was then a distraught Satyadev, with his father Jayaram's help, got Lokesh's number and sent a WhatsApp text on 22 June explaining his plight.\n\n\"We were distraught. Then the idea struck that we could approach Lokesh. I went to meet him at his Undavalli residence, but he was out of town. I somehow managed to get his mobile no. and we sent the minister a WhatsApp text,\" Satyadeb's father Maturi Jayaram told ThePrint.\n\nHaving sworn in as a minister, along with Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo and CM Chandrababu Naidu and others on 12 June, Lokesh was, at that time, yet to take charge of the HRD, IT, electronics, and Real Time Governance (RTG) portfolios allotted to him.\n\nNevertheless, Lokesh, Satyadev's parents said, responded immediately, calling them to know the problem in detail. Lokesh then summoned BIE officials and directed for an appropriate resolution, by way of replacing the 'E' marking with the average of four subject marks scored by the students.\n\nIIT-Madras authorities then directed Satyadev to get a government order released from the Andhra Pradesh Government to this effect.\n\nWhen Satyadev followed up, Lokesh immediately got the authorities to release a special government order with immediate effect and instructed officials to speak with IIT-Madras authorities.\n\nSubsequently, GO no 255 was released 28 June, awarding average marks of four subjects, i.e., Physics, Mathematics A&B, Chemistry, one language -- in place of 'E' denoting exempted language -- to children with special needs of AP intermediate 2024 exam qualifying JEE this year.\n\nWith this, not just Satyadev's admission into IIT Madras was confirmed, but another such 24 specially-abled students could also get into the IITs, NITs, IIITs etc.\n\n\"For us, Lokesh is like God sent to the education department at the right time. His active interest and involvement in resolving the issue secured the bright careers and future of my son and other such children,\" Jayaram said.\n\nNidhi Meena, commissioner, intermediate education, told ThePrint that they are processing the requests of 17 more such CwSN students who approached them subsequently for revised memos to gain entry into the top tech institutions.\n\nOn Monday, all these students, along with their grateful parents, met Lokesh at his residence at Undavalli near Amaravati.\n\nWishing them the best in their education at the premier tech institutions, Lokesh gifted them each a laptop with advanced configuration from his personal behalf.\n\n\"It was my dream to enter the IITs/NITs, when I was of your age. However, I could not crack the Indian structure of competitive exams. I am happy to see that (despite the many challenges) you have achieved your target. You are my inspiration (in my endeavours)\" he told the students, asking them to be helpful to others in ways possible to them.\n\n\"I can never forget the smile on my mother's face when I was admitted into Stanford University (for MBA). I can see the same happiness on your parents face today.\"\n\nLokesh said that his 2019 defeat in Mangalagiri made him resolute to win from the same constituency this time. \"I have also opted for the complex education sector as it is a major challenge to lead and reform it.\"\n\n\"Give us one year; we'll make big investments and jobs here. You should come back to Amaravti to serve the state,\" Lokesh told the beaming youngsters.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prasad_nichenametla@theprint.in", "name": "Prasad Nichenametla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IIT Madras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institutes of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Second language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Technology_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Technology (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Funded_Technical_Institutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government Funded Technical Institutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Seat_Allocation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Seat Allocation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayaram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayaram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Information_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institutes of Information Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayawada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ThePrint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undavalli", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undavalli"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telugu language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanskrit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Andhra Pradesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N.

The reason was that Andhra Pradesh has four subjects for disabled students in the 12th Boards, while the IITs seek scores of five subjects.\n\nThat is when the newly appointed Human Resources Development Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Nara Lokesh, proved to be their Godsend, with his instant reply to the student who had reached out to him.\n\nThis story began with Vijayawada-based student Maruthi Prithvi Satyadev, who earned the 170th rank in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced exams in the Persons with Disability (PwD) category, making him eligible for a seat at IIT Madras.\n\nHowever, Prithvi Satyadev's joy was short-lived after his application was rejected by IIT Madras.\n\nAs per Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) norms, disabled students are exempted from studying and appearing for one of the two required language papers. Consequently, Satyadev and the other students did not opt for a second language examination. They, thus, received an 'E' (Exemption) on their marksheets.\n\nThis exemption, while intended to ease the academic burden, became a significant hurdle for students, stranding their fate.\n\n\"I secured a seat in the IIT Chennai. Because of some technical issue with my intermediate marksheet, my seat had been cancelled. I Immediately texted our honourable Minister Sir Nara Lokesh. I had heard in podcasts that he takes a special interest in education. He responded within half an hour and issued a Government Order to us within a week,\" Maruthi Prithvi Satyadev, the student from Vijaywada in distress, told the media.\n\nNara Lokesh, known for his accessibility and responsiveness, immediately took action and contacted Satyadev and his father to understand the issue thoroughly and then summoned BIE officials, instructing them to replace the 'E' with 35 marks on the certificates of all agreived specially-abled students.\n\nThe Andhra Pradesh Government also issued a Government Order to validate the change in their marksheets. The Stanford-educated minister also got his officials to communicate with IIT Chennai to expedite the process.\n\nWith the GO in hand, Satyadev's admission to IIT Chennai was confirmed, along with the admissions of the 24 other specially-abled students.\n\nDays later, when all 25 students visited Lokesh at his residence in Amaravati to thank him, Lokesh felicitated them, gifting each student a high-configuration Dell laptop.\n\n\"I was initially very depressed to realise that I could not fulfil my IIT dream. But within days, Nara Lokesh Sir helped us and helped us get our seats back. He wished us well, motivated and assured us of job opportunities in the years to come,\" a student who had been chosen for Computer Science Engineering at IIT Guwahati, told India Today TV.\n\n\"We approached Lokesh Sir regarding this problem. I'm happy that I'm able to say proudly I'm going to IIT,\" another student, Snehita, told India Today TV.\n\nDays later, while hosting and facilitating the 25 students at his Amaravati residence, Nara Lokesh underlined his belief in \"abilities, not disabilities\".\n\n\"Everyone is equal, and everyone deserves equal opportunities.

Pruthvi, who has a mobility disability, had bagged a seat at the IIT Madras but his admission was put on hold due to a red flag raised over his intermediate mark sheet.\n\nAccording to the Board of Intermediate Education, in Andhra Pradesh, specially-abled students are exempted from appearing for any one of the two languages, effectively writing only four of the total five subjects in their intermediate exams but this turned out to be a distressing situation for Pruthvi and 24 other students as IITs only accept marks memo with five subjects, subsequently freezing their admissions despite getting A grades.\n\nFollowing Pruthvi's S.O.S message, the state's education minister Lokesh directed the officials to issue a government order with a revised marksheet adding a fifth subject with an average of the other four subjects that they had already written. Additionally, the state government also reached out to the IIT council to streamline the process.\n\nA similar approach was also adopted for students who had secured admissions into NITs and other top institutes. \"The state government's prompt action has not only secured our future but also cleared the path for so many other students who would have had to face a similar situation,\" said Pruthvi.\n\nBefore setting off to live their IIT dream, the students accompanied by their family members met with Lokesh at his residence in Undavalli. \"Really proud that close to 40 handicapped children, merely because of a GO were able to qualify into IITs and NITs.

IIT Madras authorities raised an objection. Then Satyadev sent a WhatsApp message to Lokesh on June 22 explaining the problem. Lokesh immediately instructed the Intermediate Board to look into the matter. Later, the board issued a memo with marks stating that 'E' as a minimum of 35 marks.

Nara Lokesh directed the officials to release a special GO to solve the problem of disabled students in the inter marks list.\n\nAt a programme at his residence in Undavalli, Lokesh congratulated the disabled students who got seats through the government's initiative.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institutes of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Lokesh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nara Lokesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaravati", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amaravati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination_\u2013_Advanced", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Entrance Examination \u2013 Advanced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayawada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IIT Madras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undavalli", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undavalli"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/08-07-2024/1200-675-21897603-thumbnail-16x9-lo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715224", "eventUri": "eng-9715224", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1079, "textEnd": 1086}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

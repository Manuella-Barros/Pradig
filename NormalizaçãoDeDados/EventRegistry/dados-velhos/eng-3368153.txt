South Sudan's capital, Juba, in July 2016.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in

sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.\n\n\"This unhappy 1-million milestone must serve as a wake-up call to the international community that much more is needed from them,\" Sarah Jackson, an Amnesty International official in the region, said in a statement Thursday. \"With no resolution to the conflict in South Sudan in sight, refugees will continue to flee to

He also met with President Omer al-Bashir and foreign minister Ibrahim Ghanour.\n\n\"For decades, Sudan has kept its doors open to people fleeing war, hunger and hardship.

Hundreds of thousands of other South Sudanese who stayed in Sudan following the separation of the two countries are also in need of humanitarian assistance.

Al-Nimir camp hosts more than 5,000 refugees - over 90 per cent of them women and children.\n\n\"I want to say to the world that Sudan is keeping its doors open at a time when so many countries are closing doors,\" Grandi said,\n\nThe High Commissioner also appealed for more help for Sudan. \"Often, we forget that Sudan continues to be a very key host country not just for South Sudanese but for Eritreans, Syrians and many other refugees,\" he said.\n\nGrandi praised the model of cooperation and coexistence between refugees and the local communities in Sudan.\n\n\"Throughout the world, we are experimenting with new ways to promote livelihoods, to promote new sources of energy and other forms of sustainable development for refugees and for the communities hosting them. I think that Sudan qualifies very much for this model of development.\"\n\nDuring his visit to the camp, Grandi met Sadia Mohammed Wali, a 42 year-old refugee mother. Sadia fled South Sudan with her seven children when fighting erupted in her home town back in June this year.\n\n\"We came with our children and we had nothing to feed them.\"\n\n\"We were very scared,\" she said giving details of her month-long trip to reach safety in Sudan. \"The journey was so difficult for us, because we came with our children and we had nothing to feed them. We were moving in huge groups,\" she said. \"Those who carried some small foods would share and we gave them to the children.\"\n\nShe expressed her desire for her children to get a good education and get some help herself to support her small business, selling roasted peanuts, dumplings and sweets.\n\nSudan hosts some 416,000 refugees from South Sudan since 2013 - including some 170,000 new arrivals so far this year.\n\nSouth Sudan became the world's youngest country when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011..\n\nHundreds of thousands of other refugees - who stayed in Sudan following the partition are also in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nOn Wednesday, the UN Refugee Chief concluded his visit by meeting with Sudan's leaders and authorities in Khartoum.", "id": "9499632", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "More urgency needed in quest for South Sudan peace - UN Refugee Chief", "image": "http://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/599440cf3.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "312048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba", "label": {"eng": "Juba"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Filippo Grandi"}, "id": "353854", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Grandi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugees of Sudan"}, "id": "394371", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_Sudan"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "428101", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Darfur", "label": {"eng": "East Darfur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1014, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare"}], "time": "14:34:00"}

Rebel forces said Tuesday they had reclaimed their stronghold of Pagak in the northeast, less than a week after being pushed out by government forces.\n\nBoth sides have committed serious rights violations, including murder and rape, against civilians, according to U.N. investigators.", "id": "9621922", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "1 million South Sudan refugees now in Uganda, UN says", "image": "https://cmgfeeds.cmgdigital.com/photo/2017/08/17/Uganda_South_Sudan_One_Million_Refugees_74942_8880646_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 568, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 577}, {"textStart": 1337, "date": "2013-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1350}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "39", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "40", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic", "label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "114", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}, "id": "310451", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "312048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba", "label": {"eng": "Juba"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conscription"}, "id": "321992", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "06:13:00"}

Since then the war has spread across the country, sweeping up ethnic groups and local grievances.\n\nOverall the refugee population from South Sudan has reached about two million, of whom more than 430,000 have taken refuge in Sudan, the United Nations says.\n\nGrandi praised Khartoum for opening \"human corridors\" to deliver aid directly from Sudan to areas of South Sudan, and for hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees.\n\n\"Sudan has kept its doors open at a time when so many countries have closed their doors,\" he said, addressing hundreds of refugees gathered to meet him in the sprawling camp of thatched huts and brick homes.\n\nGrandi said it was time to develop \"new models\" for aiding refugees, rather than just keeping them in camps.\n\n\"For how long can you support these camps?\" he said as aid agencies face increasing financial struggles.\n\nIt would be better to support the local economy, he said, as that would \"benefit the refugees also\".\n\nWhile touring the camp, Grandi visited a newly built school as well as some refugee families in their huts, where women described how they fled the war at home.\n\n\"We will now return only when there is peace in our country,\" one woman, who came to Al Nimir in May, told Grandi.\n\n\"Don't lose hope,\" Grandi told her, as behind him groups of refugees performed traditional dances to mark his visit.\n\nUrging Khartoum to continue supporting the refugees, Grandi said the occupants of camps should also \"respect the law\" of the land.\n\nEarlier this month a mob of South Sudanese refugees went on a rampage at the al-Waral camp in Sudan's southern White Nile state after reports that a refugee youth had died in police custody.\n\nThe mob burned down the camp's administrative buildings and looted warehouses, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said.\n\nKhartoum now plans to split the al-Waral camp, which has more than 50,000 South Sudanese refugees, into three separate units.\n\n\"It worries me if the law is broken, and it worries me that this may open up a feeling of hostility to the refugees,\" said Grandi when asked about the unrest.", "id": "9406496", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16",

Since then the war has spread across the country, sweeping up ethnic groups and local grievances.\n\nOverall the refugee population from South Sudan has reached about two million, of whom more than 430,000 have taken refuge in Sudan, the United Nations says.\n\nGrandi praised Khartoum for opening \"human corridors\" to deliver aid directly from Sudan to areas of South Sudan, and for hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees.\n\n\"Sudan has kept its doors open at a time when so many countries have closed their doors,\" he said, addressing hundreds of refugees gathered to meet him in the sprawling camp of thatched huts and brick homes.\n\nGrandi said it was time to develop \"new models\" for aiding refugees, rather than just keeping them in camps.\n\n\"For how long can you support these camps?\" he said as aid agencies face increasing financial struggles.\n\nIt would be better to support the local economy, he said, as that would \"benefit the refugees also\".\n\nWhile touring the camp, Grandi visited a newly built school as well as some refugee families in their huts, where women described how they fled the war at home.\n\n\"We will now return only when there is peace in our country,\" one woman, who came to Al Nimir in May, told Grandi.\n\n\"Don't lose hope,\" Grandi told her, as behind him groups of refugees performed traditional dances to mark his visit.\n\nUrging Khartoum to continue supporting the refugees, Grandi said the occupants of camps should also \"respect the law\" of the land.\n\nEarlier this month a mob of South Sudanese refugees went on a rampage at the al-Waral camp in Sudan's southern White Nile state after reports that a refugee youth had died in police custody.\n\nThe mob burned down the camp's administrative buildings and looted warehouses, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said.\n\nKhartoum now plans to split the al-Waral camp, which has more than 50,000 South Sudanese refugees, into three separate units.\n\n\"It worries me if the law is broken, and it worries me that this may open up a feeling of hostility to the refugees,\" said Grandi when asked about the unrest.", "id": "9502031", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16",

The trickle of refugees into Uganda swelled into a river last year after a shaky Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed within months. The conflict has further fragmented since, breeding a patchwork of militias and briefly plunging parts of the country into famine this year.

Rebel forces said on 15 August they had reclaimed their stronghold of Pagak in the northeast, less than a week after being pushed out by government forces.\n\nBoth sides have committed serious rights violations, including murder and rape, against civilians, according to UN investigators.\n\nThe UN officially confirmed today (17 August) that the number of South Sudanese refugees sheltering in Uganda has reached 1 million. Ugandan officials say they are overwhelmed by the flow of people fleeing South Sudan's civil war and the UN refugee agency is urging the international community to donate more for humanitarian assistance.\n\nUganda, in particular, the West Nile region, has a long history of hosting refugees from the neighbouring countries of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan and the present-day South Sudan. Since 2014, Uganda has witnessed a continuous influx of South Sudanese refugees fleeing from violence and destruction. As of June 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had registered more than 950,000 South Sudanese refugees (mainly women and children) in Uganda who are resettled into the various settlements in the countryside of Uganda.\n\nWorld Vision, a Christian relief, development and advocacy organisation dedicated to working with children, families and communities worldwide, has been on the ground responding refugees in northern Uganda since 2014.\n\nThe 36-page study, for which 1,135 respondents have been interviewed, finds that food scarcity among the refugees and the host communities are driving prices of essential food items. Both communities have resulted in reducing meals and relying on less expensive foods to cope with the situation.\n\nThe majority of the refugees rely on food assistance for their livelihood. In total, 58% are not participating in any economic activity while 24% are engaged in farming activities by renting out land from the host communities.\n\nRefugees are mainly concerned with a reduction in food distributed by the World Food Programme (WFP) while host communities are particularly worried about the scarcity of food in markets causing the inflation of prices of staples such as cassava flour, which has doubled in price since December 2016.\n\nBoth the host communities and refugees are mainly relying on firewood for cooking, creating competition for this shared resource.\n\nJustin Byworth, World Vision Brussels' Executive Director, commended Uganda as \"leading the world\" in their refugee response. But he warned that without EU assistance the situation will quickly get out of control.\n\n\"They [Uganda] provided refugee families with plots of land so that people can build homes and grow gardens. The EU and its member states must not wait for Uganda to reach a breaking point before stepping up support and increasing long term resources to support refugees and the communities hosting them,\" Byworth said.\n\nThe World Vision official added: \"More can be done to prevent the crisis from slipping into an irrecoverable state. The EU and its member states must continue to address the crisis and ensure protection of children, right to food, and economic developments are sustained for host communities and refugees.\"\n\nA fundraising summit hosted by Uganda in June raised only a fraction of the $2 billion that Ugandan officials have said is needed to sufficiently look after the refugees and the communities hosting them.\n\n\"This unhappy 1 million milestone must serve as a wake-up call to the international community that much more is needed from them,\" Sarah Jackson, an Amnesty International official in the region, said in a statement Thursday. \"With no resolution to the conflict in South Sudan in sight, refugees will continue to flee to Uganda and the humanitarian crisis will only escalate.\"", "id": "9695904", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New crisis emerges as South Sudan refugees in Uganda hit one million", "image": "http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/Unaccompanied-minors-from-South-Sudan-in-refugee-camp-in-Uganda.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 172, "date": "2017-06-22", "amb": false, "textEnd": 184}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 738, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 747}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1040, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1049}, {"textStart": 501, "date": "2017-08-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 512}, {"textStart": 1663, "date": "2017-06-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1672}, {"textStart": 2935, "date": "2016-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2948}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "39", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}, "id": "308426", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}, "id": "310451", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Vision International"}, "id": "316111", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_International"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "319140", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile", "label": {"eng": "Nile"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cassava"}, "id": "328727", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}, "id": "340998", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugees of Sudan"}, "id": "394371", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 11, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "13:19:00"}

The number of South Sudanese who have fled to Uganda has hit one million, the UN said Thursday, with no end in sight to the war behind the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.\n\nThe nearly four-year civil war has pushed an average of 1,800 South Sudanese into neighbouring Uganda every day for the past year, many of them women and children fleeing \"barbaric violence\", according to the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR).\n\nAnother one million have sought refuge elsewhere in the region, but it is Uganda -- one of the world's poorest countries and the size of the United Kingdom -- that has borne the brunt of the crisis.\n\n\"We still have new arrivals coming, and we cannot really see, you can say, the end of the new arrivals,\" said Bik Lum, head of the UNHCR in Arua in northern Uganda, home to Bidibidi, the world's largest refugee camp with around 270,000 residents.\n\nSouth Sudan's civil war began in December 2013 just two years after it obtained independence, when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup.\n\nOverwhelming misery\n\nThe conflict initially pitted Machar's ethnic Nuer against Kiir's Dinka, but since the collapse of a peace agreement in 2015, the war has engulfed other ethnic groups and local grievances.\n\nThousands of people have been killed and millions displaced by the violence, which plunged part of the country into famine earlier this year.\n\n\"The number of hungry and displaced South Sudanese is overwhelming,\" said International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) president Peter Maurer.\n\n\"The staggering scale of suffering is evidence of the cumulative effect of three-and-a-half years of a style of fighting that appears calibrated to maximise misery. Warfare should not directly impact the lives of so many civilians.\"\n\nIn addition to the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, at least a million more have fled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to UN numbers.\n\nAn additional two million people are internally displaced.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the UNCHR said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR estimates it will need $674 million this year alone to help the refugees in Uganda, but said that so far it had received just a fifth of that amount.\n\nQuestions over figures\n\nIn June, The UN's World Food Programme had to slash food rations for refugees in the country, while doctors, nurses and medicines are in short supply, it said.\n\nSchooling has also been affected.\n\n\"Normal classrooms will have at least 53 or 55 students. But on average here, one classroom is having 110 pupils under a teacher, under the same roof,\" said Simon Abukua, principal of the Ocea Primary School. \"And when a teacher is inside there, the teacher has nowhere to stand.\"\n\nWhile there is no denying the gravity of the situation, questions have been raised over the accuracy of the number of refugees.\n\nResponsibility for registering the number of new arrivals falls to the Ugandan prime minister's office, but development and emergency workers have for months privately expressed concern that the numbers of refugees may be inflated.\n\nElizabeth Pfifer, Uganda country representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) NGO, says only the planned biometric registration of refugees will \"help to relieve some of the inconsistencies and questions around the actual numbers.\"\n\n\"Some households have registered multiple times because there are different lists but now having biometric registration cards is going to give us a better sense of actual numbers,\" Pfifer told AFP.\n\nUganda has long been praised for having one of the world's most progressive refugee policies.\n\nThe government allows refugees to work and move around the country while communities in the north have donated land for settlements.\n\nHowever the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed local communities and strained their hospitality.\n\nThe figure of one million refugees arriving in Uganda compares with a similar number of migrants who arrived in Europe during the height of its migrant crisis in 2015.\n\nAnd with no end in sight to South Sudan's woes, the refugees are unlikely to go home anytime soon.\n\n\"If the government is changed and we have a new leader with a new government system, maybe I will come,\" said Jasmine Ramadan, a refugee working as a shopkeeper, who fled the violence.\n\n\"Because, what they did to me.

Thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced by the violence, which plunged part of the country into famine earlier this year.\n\n\"The number of hungry and displaced South Sudanese is overwhelming,\" said International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) president Peter Maurer. \"The staggering scale of suffering is evidence of the cumulative effect of three-and-a-half years of a style of fighting that appears calibrated to maximise misery. Warfare should not directly impact the lives of so many civilians.\"\n\nIn addition to the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, at least a million more have fled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to UN numbers. An additional two million people are internally displaced.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the UNCHR said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR estimates it will need $674 million (576 million euros) this year alone to help the refugees in Uganda, but said that so far it had received just a fifth of that amount. In June, The UN's World Food Programme had to slash food rations for refugees in the country, while doctors, nurses and medicines are in short supply, it said.\n\nSchooling has also been affected. \"Normal classrooms will have at least 53 or 55 students. But on average here, one classroom is having 110 pupils under a teacher, under the same roof,\" said Simon Abukua, principal of the Ocea Primary School.\n\n\"And when a teacher is inside there, the teacher has nowhere to stand.\" While there is no denying the gravity of the situation, questions have been raised over the accuracy of the number of refugees. Responsibility for registering the number of new arrivals falls to the Ugandan prime minister's office, but development and emergency workers have for months privately expressed concern that the numbers of refugees may be inflated.\n\nElizabeth Pfifer, Uganda country representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) NGO, says only the planned biometric registration of refugees will \"help to relieve some of the inconsistencies and questions around the actual numbers.\" \"Some households have registered multiple times because there are different lists but now having biometric registration cards is going to give us a better sense of actual numbers,\" Pfifer told AFP.\n\nUganda has long been praised for having one of the world's most progressive refugee policies. The government allows refugees to work and move around the country while communities in the north have donated land for settlements. However the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed local communities and strained their hospitality.\n\nThe figure of one million refugees arriving in Uganda compares with a similar number of migrants who arrived in Europe during the height of its migrant crisis in 2015. And with no end in sight to South Sudan's woes, the refugees are unlikely to go home anytime soon.\n\n\"If the government is changed and we have a new leader with a new government system, maybe I will come,\" said Jasmine Ramadan, a refugee working as a shopkeeper, who fled the violence. \"Because, what they did to me... I don't feel like going back.\"", "id": "9716370", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "  More than one million S.Sudan refugees in Uganda: UN", "image":

Warfare should not directly impact the lives of so many civilians.\"\n\nIn addition to the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, at least a million more have fled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to UN numbers.\n\nAn additional two million people are internally displaced.\n\nSHORT SUPPLY\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the UNCHR said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR estimates it will need $674 million (576 million euros) this year alone to help the refugees in Uganda, but said that so far it had received just a fifth of that amount.\n\nIn June, The UN's World Food Programme had to slash food rations for refugees in the country, while doctors, nurses and medicines are in short supply, it said.\n\nSchooling has also been affected.\n\n\"Normal classrooms will have at least 53 or 55 students. But on average here, one classroom is having 110 pupils under a teacher, under the same roof,\" said Simon Abukua, principal of the Ocea Primary School.\n\n\"And when a teacher is inside there, the teacher has nowhere to stand.\"\n\nACCURACY\n\nWhile there is no denying the gravity of the situation, questions have been raised over the accuracy of the number of refugees.\n\nResponsibility for registering the number of new arrivals falls to the Ugandan prime minister's office, but development and emergency workers have for months privately expressed concern that the numbers of refugees may be inflated.\n\nElizabeth Pfifer, Uganda Country Representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) NGO, says only the planned biometric registration of refugees will \"help to relieve some of the inconsistencies and questions around the actual numbers.\"\n\n\"Some households have registered multiple times because there are different lists but having biometric registration cards is going to give us a better sense of actual numbers,\" Ms Pfifer told AFP.\n\nUganda has long been praised for having one of the world's most progressive refugee policies.\n\nThe government allows refugees to work and move around the country while communities in the north have donated land for settlements.\n\nOVERWHELMED\n\nHowever the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed local communities and strained their hospitality.\n\nThe figure of one million refugees arriving in Uganda compares with a similar number of migrants who arrived in Europe during the height of its migrant crisis in 2015.\n\nAnd with no end in sight to South Sudan's woes, the refugees are unlikely to go home anytime soon.\n\n\"If the government is changed and we have a new leader with a new government system, maybe I will come,\" said Jasmine Ramadan, a refugee working as a shopkeeper, who fled the violence.\n\n\"Because of what they did to me...

The majority of them have fled to Uganda, with humanitarian organisations estimating an average of 1,800 people crossed the border every day for the past 12 months.\n\nUganda is now hosting more refugees than any other country in Africa. It is home to the world's largest refugee camp, Bidi Bidi, home to some 300,000 refugees, the majority of whom are South Sudanese.\n\nUganda has adopted an open policy with regards to refugees, but the amount of people crossing into the country every day is depleting the country's resources amid a funding shortfall. There are fears the huge influx of people might lead to tensions with local communities.\n\nIn June, the World Food Programme was forced to cut food rations for refugees. Health clinics across the country are also experiencing a lack of doctors, healthcare workers and medicine.\n\n\"For Uganda, $674m is needed for South Sudanese refugees this year, but so far only a fifth of this amount has been received,\" the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said in a statement.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the organisation continued.\n\nHumanitarian organisations believe that the number of refugees will further increase if the war in South Sudan continues.\n\n\"As long as the senseless, costly and brutal war in South Sudan continues, its people will continue to flee in search of safety, food, water and shelter,\" Lydia Zigomo, Oxfam's Regional Director of the Horn, East and Central Africa, said.\n\n\"More than anything they need peace at home. South Sudan's neighbours and the international community must honour their commitments to get the warring parties back to the negotiating table. Until then, it will not be safe for South Sudanese refugees to return home, forcing them to depend on aid across the border.\"\n\nChildren\n\nIt has been estimated that around 100 South Sudanese children cross into Uganda every day. They are often unaccompanied and their mental and physical health is at risk due to the atrocities they were subjected to.\n\nChildren's charity World Vision has warned children could go back to South Sudan and take part in the conflict, unless they receive adequate care in the hosting country.\n\n\"We have to make sure that children on the move are protected and that when they arrive, they are able to have opportunities to fully participate in society here,\" said Enid Kabasinguzi Ocaya, World Vision's Disaster Risk Reduction and Humanitarian Emergency Affairs Manager in Uganda.\n\nUK International Development Secretary Priti Patel showed solidarity to refugees and the Ugandan government.\n\n\"I've seen first-hand the appalling conditions where men, women and children are starving to death, but I have also been proud to see UK aid providing a lifeline in South Sudan and in Uganda - by providing urgent food, water and shelter, and also helping people to rebuild their lives,\" she said in a statement sent to IBTimes UK earlier this year.\n\nSince 2014, the UK has provided \u00a393.5m ($122m) of funding to the refugee response in Uganda. The support has contributed to, among other projects, providing food or cash-based equivalent to 1.2 million refugees, vaccinations to 210,000 child refugees and shelter to 56,255 people. Hundreds of thousands of people have also been provided with clean water and items including blankets and cooking utensils.\n\nSouth Sudan's conflict explained\n\nSouth Sudan became world's newest nation in 2011, after it broke away from Sudan. However, the newly created country has known very little peace, as it descended into war just two years after its creation.\n\nThe conflict erupted in 2013 when President Salva Kiir, of the Dinka ethnic group, fired his deputy Riek Machar - from the Nuer group. Machar then became a rebel leader.\n\nFighting between rebels and government troops has killed an estimated 50,000 people, amid allegations of crimes against humanity committed by both sides, including rape, torture and the use of child soldiers.\n\nThe conflict has progressively continued along ethnic lines, with tit-for-tat violence targeting Dinka and Nuer tribes, prompting the UN to repeatedly warn the country is on the verge of a Rwanda-style genocide.\n\nKiir and Machar have agreed on several peace deals - the last of which was signed in August 2015 - but have failed to control their troops, who have broken every ceasefire since 2014.\n\nEarlier this year, the government declared a unilateral ceasefire to promote peace. However, in in May, rebels loyal to Machar rejected the government's offer of dialogue.", "id": "9665134", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "One million South Sudanese refugees have found safety in Uganda - but resources are running low", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1625476/south-sudanese-refugees-uganda.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 4749, "date": "2015-08-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4760}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "id": "305935", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}, "id": "310451", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}, "id": "310802", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Salva Kiir Mayardit"}, "id": "312042", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir_Mayardit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Riek Machar"}, "id": "312046", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riek_Machar"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Vision International"}, "id": "316111", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuer people"}, "id": "319081", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dinka people"}, "id": "332305", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinka_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central Africa"}, "id": "333920", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Priti Patel"}, "id": "340974", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oxfam"}, "id": "371348", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Military use of children"}, "id": "373712", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "10:38:00"}

We see health clinics with insufficient doctors, drugs and health care workers. Let us be clear, this is a real children's crisis. It is children that are being forced to flee through the bush often in the middle of the night for days, if not weeks on end, so there is a desperate need for a surge of solidarity with Uganda in order to ensure that these refugees are able to live in safety and in dignity.\"\n\nYaxley says a resolution to the conflict in South Sudan appears nowhere in sight.\n\n\"So it is key that the international community comes forward to use the political influence they have over the leadership in South Sudan to bring the warring factions together to the table and dialogue so that we can bring an end to the bloodshed,\" he said.\n\nFor now, all the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda can do is wait.", "id": "9800081", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "South Sudanese Refugees in Uganda Reach One Million", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 862, "date": "2013-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 875}, {"textStart": 1488, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1497}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}, "id": "306866", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}, "id": "328357", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross"}, {"label": {"eng": "South Sudanese Civil War"}, "id": "357673", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Rescue Committee"}, "id": "398457", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee"}, {"label": {"eng": "European migrant crisis"}, "id": "1269257", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)"}, "id": "1271570", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015\u2013present)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "00:29:00"}

This is what's going on.\n\n1. Uganda is home to more refugees than any other country in Africa\n\nWith 1,3 million refugees by August 2017, Uganda hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world. The reason behind the severe influx is the conflict in South Sudan. Each day an average of thousands of refugees have crossed the border to Uganda since fighting re-erupted in the capital Juba in July 2016. Within the region, Uganda has received the highest number of South Sudanese refugees, now one million.\n\nThe number of internally displaced people included, four million South Sudanese have left their homes, and this makes it one of the largest refugee crises globally. Only Syria and Afghanistan are producing more refugees.\n\n2. An overwhelming majority of the South Sudanese refugees are women and children\n\nMore than 85 percent of the South Sudanese refugees in Uganda are women and children, who have traveled by foot to escape a devastating civil war. According to their stories, adult males - brothers, fathers and husbands - have been killed, captured or recruited by armed groups. Opportunities for education and livelihoods are therefore extremely important for this refugee population.\n\n61 percent of the South Sudanese refugees who have arrived since July 2016 are children under 18 years old. Having access to protective and quality education is an essential part of the rehabilitation process for these children whose childhood has been cut short through horrific experiences while fleeing their homes. The provision of education to these children does not only give them hope for a better future, but it also affirms them that their futures are worth believing in.\n\n3. Uganda is at a breaking point\n\nUganda has one of the most progressive refugee policies in the world. After registration, refugees have the right to study, work, set up enterprises and move freely within the country - all the same rights as native Ugandans apart from the right to vote. Refugees also receive a plot of land at the refugee settlements for cultivation.\n\nBut Uganda is also one of the world's poorest countries. The pace of arrivals has been tough to keep up with, and the UN has warned that Uganda is at a \"breaking point\".\n\n4. Uganda needs international support to maintain its transformational refugee policies\n\nUganda needs the support of the international community to keep . The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR says it needs around 570 million euros to ensure minimum humanitarian standards are met properly, but this far it has received only 17 percent of it.\n\nThe funding gap delays projects like providing permanent shelters by months and people are vulnerable to changing weather conditions. Children attend schools in temporary tents, easily taken down and destroyed by high winds and rains. Food rations have been cut several times and creating new plots for farming is an enormous task as new settlements open.\n\nFinn Church Aid supports education and livelihood opportunities for refugees in Uganda.

Warfare should not directly impact the lives of so many civilians.\"\n\nIn addition to the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, at least a million more have fled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to UN numbers.\n\nAn additional two million people are internally displaced.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the UNCHR said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR estimates it will need $674 million (576 million euros) this year alone to help the refugees in Uganda, but said that so far it had received just a fifth of that amount.\n\n- Questions over figures -\n\nIn June, The UN's World Food Programme had to slash food rations for refugees in the country, while doctors, nurses and medicines are in short supply, it said.\n\nSchooling has also been affected.\n\n\"Normal classrooms will have at least 53 or 55 students. But on average here, one classroom is having 110 pupils under a teacher, under the same roof,\" said Simon Abukua, principal of the Ocea Primary School.\n\n\"And when a teacher is inside there, the teacher has nowhere to stand.\"\n\nWhile there is no denying the gravity of the situation, questions have been raised over the accuracy of the number of refugees.\n\nResponsibility for registering the number of new arrivals falls to the Ugandan prime minister's office, but development and emergency workers have for months privately expressed concern that the numbers of refugees may be inflated.\n\nElizabeth Pfifer, Uganda country representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) NGO, says only the planned biometric registration of refugees will \"help to relieve some of the inconsistencies and questions around the actual numbers.\"\n\n\"Some households have registered multiple times because there are different lists but now having biometric registration cards is going to give us a better sense of actual numbers,\" Pfifer told AFP.\n\nUganda has long been praised for having one of the world's most progressive refugee policies.\n\nThe government allows refugees to work and move around the country while communities in the north have donated land for settlements.\n\nHowever the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed local communities and strained their hospitality.\n\nThe figure of one million refugees arriving in Uganda compares with a similar number of migrants who arrived in Europe during the height of its migrant crisis in 2015.\n\nAnd with no end in sight to South Sudan's woes, the refugees are unlikely to go home anytime soon.\n\n\"If the government is changed and we have a new leader with a new government system, maybe I will come,\" said Jasmine Ramadan, a refugee working as a shopkeeper, who fled the violence.\n\n\"Because, what they did to me...

But coupled with lack of food and of course one thing compounds the other, clearly,\" said Grandi.\n\nSouth Sudan was plunged into war in 2013 after a political disagreement between President Salva Kiir and opposition leader and former vice president Riek Machar strained relations between the two. Kiir then sacked Machar as his deputy, triggering fighting between forces loyal to both men.\n\nKiir hails from the Dinka while Machar is a Nuer and the rivalry between the two tribes has meant much of the fighting and violence has unfolded along ethnic divisions.\n\nSadia Mohamed and her children are amongst 400,000 South Sudanese refugees who fled to Darfur.\n\nThe 42-year-old mother of seven left after her home was attacked in June, and travelled for more than a month to find safety.\n\n\"You were afraid?\" asked Grandi.\n\n\"We were afraid because there was a lot of shooting. There were explosions and shooting everywhere. We just had to protect the children and run with them,\" added Sadia.\n\nSadia lost everything. She hopes she can rebuild her life here.\n\n\"I would like my children to continue with education. I had some income generating activities back at home, but here I have nothing to do. I cannot provide a good life for my children,\" she said.\n\nDuring his visit to Sudan, Grandi also highlighted the country's key role in hosting hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese refugees.\n\nSudan has registered some 170,000 new arrivals so far this year.\n\n\"I was impressed by the hospitality that is provided here in this particular location by the local community to the refugees,\" Grandi added.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people have fled the country since fighting erupted in 2013, and the refugee crisis could worsen as efforts to restore peace have so far proven unsuccessful.\n\n\"This is very sad that after all these months of bleeding its population outside, South Sudan has not yet found peace and this is really the responsibility of its leadership, of its opposition to start behaving responsibly,\" said Grandi.\n\nThe conflict in South Sudan has created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and U.N. agencies are receiving a fraction of the cash they need to provide food and shelter.", "id": "9729846", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "More Urgency Needed In Quest For South Sudan Peace - UN Refugee Chief * Channels Television", "image": "https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/south-sudan.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Darfur Wilayat"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "10935", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "label": {"eng": "Darfur Wilayat"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Salva Kiir Mayardit"}, "id": "312042", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir_Mayardit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Riek Machar"}, "id": "312046", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riek_Machar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuer people"}, "id": "319081", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuer_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dinka people"}, "id": "332305", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinka_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Filippo Grandi"}, "id": "353854", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Grandi"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "428101", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Darfur", "label": {"eng": "East Darfur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European migrant crisis"}, "id": "1269257", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "16:11:00"}

Warfare should not directly impact the lives of so many civilians.\"\n\nIn addition to the one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, at least a million more have fled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to UN numbers.\n\nAn additional two million people are internally displaced.\n\n\"Recent arrivals continue to speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls, and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,\" the UNCHR said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR estimates it will need $A850 million (\u20ac576 million) this year alone to help the refugees in Uganda, but said that so far it had received just a fifth of that amount.\n\nIn June, the UN's World Food Programme had to slash food rations for refugees in the country, while doctors, nurses and medicines are in short supply, it said.\n\nSchooling has also been affected.\n\n\"Normal classrooms will have at least 53 or 55 students. But on average here, one classroom is having 110 pupils under a teacher, under the same roof,\" said Simon Abukua, principal of the Ocea Primary School.\n\n\"And when a teacher is inside there, the teacher has nowhere to stand.\"\n\nWhile there is no denying the gravity of the situation, questions have been raised over the accuracy of the number of refugees.\n\nResponsibility for registering the number of new arrivals falls to the Ugandan prime minister's office, but development and emergency workers have for months privately expressed concern that the numbers of refugees may be inflated.\n\nElizabeth Pfifer, Uganda country representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) NGO, says only the planned biometric registration of refugees will \"help to relieve some of the inconsistencies and questions around the actual numbers.\"\n\n\"Some households have registered multiple times because there are different lists but now having biometric registration cards is going to give us a better sense of actual numbers,\" Pfifer told AFP.\n\nUganda has long been praised for having one of the world's most progressive refugee policies.\n\nThe government allows refugees to work and move around the country while communities in the north have donated land for settlements.\n\nHowever the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed local communities and strained their hospitality.\n\nThe figure of one million refugees arriving in Uganda compares with a similar number of migrants who arrived in Europe during the height of its migrant crisis in 2015.\n\nAnd with no end in sight to South Sudan's woes, the refugees are unlikely to go home anytime soon.\n\n\"If the government is changed and we have a new leader with a new government system, maybe I will come,\" said Jasmine Ramadan, a refugee working as a shopkeeper, who fled the violence.\n\n\"Because, what they did to me...

We have nothing.\"\n\nREAD: Sudan plans to split South Sudanese refugee camp\n\nOil-rich South Sudan became the world's youngest nation in 2011, upon its independence from neighbouring Sudan, but the elation soon evaporated amid corruption and ethnic divisions.\n\nTroops loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and forces under former vice president Riek Machar, from the Nuer ethnic group, have battled each other since late 2013, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes.\n\nThe trickle of refugees into Uganda swelled into a river last year after a shaky Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed within months.\n\nThe conflict has further fragmented since, breeding a patchwork of militias and briefly plunging parts of the country into famine this year.\n\nNo one knows how many have died, but an August report by South Africa-based South Sudan Human Rights Observatory said 987 civilians were killed in violence across South Sudan between May and July, mostly by government forces.\n\n\"They are slaughtering people with knives,\" said Samuel Amule, who trekked for two days to the border to escape government attacks. \"They say, 'If you are staying here, you are a rebel.'\"\n\nThe UN said homes have been burned with families locked inside, gang rapes are common and boys are often kidnapped to be child soldiers. Gunmen, including South Sudanese rebels, rob those trying to escape.\n\nSafety and scarcity\n\nIn Uganda, South Sudanese refugees receive hot meals, vaccinations, and plots of land. All can enter and they are free to travel and work in Uganda, policies that have drawn praise from aid groups.\n\n\"The government response to accepting the South Sudanese refugees has been overwhelmingly positive, progressive, and welcoming,\" said Sacha Manov, deputy director in Uganda for the International Rescue Committee, which provides health and protection services for refugees.\n\nBut refugee agency UNHCR said Uganda was struggling to provide food and shelter.\n\nDonor nations have not given enough, with the UN agency having received just about 21 percent of the $674-million (R8.8-billion) needed for South Sudanese refugees in Uganda in 2017, its spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said.\n\n\"That's leaving significant gaps in the abilities of the humanitarian response to deliver lifesaving assistance and also key basic services,\" he added.\n\nIn Amugo camp, new arrivals sleep under loose white tarpaulins as they lack the tools to build proper shelters.

More than three quarters of them have crossed the border following a major uptick in violence in July 2016, and 86% of those who have settled in Uganda overall are women and children.\n\nSince then, South Sudan has continued its downward spiral of violence, and a famine was declared for the first time in over six years in the country's northern Unity state. Uganda had two options: to try to keep refugees out because of the burden they may represent for a still developing country, or to embrace the refugees from South Sudan as brothers and sisters who needed help and a chance to start a new life somewhere safe. Uganda and its leaders have chosen the second option.\n\nBidi Bidi refugee settlement is now the largest of over 20 settlements in Uganda, and also of its kind in the world. Refugees in Uganda are given land to live and grow crops on, tools to build new homes, education for their children and the right to work and start businesses. However, the developing country is severely lacking the funds and resources to respond to the massive influx. Low crop yield has also created significant food shortages and increased malnutrition (average global acute malnutrition 15%; anemia 40%) throughout the area. The monthly food requirement for refugees is approximately US$15M, but WFP had to cut cereal rations in half in May. There is critical need to establish long-term funding streams for the continuation of high quality programming, as only 17% of the around US$673M required for the overall response has been raised as of August 4.\n\n\"There is tragic irony that when Uganda is accepting its millionth refugee from South Sudan, with thousands more arriving every day, the United States and Europe, with such greater resources, are trying to close the door,\" said David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. \"There is a lesson here. We should be giving aid to countries like Uganda but we should also be standing with them. If Uganda can open its arms to the vulnerable fleeing war, so can the western world.\"\n\nThe average income in Uganda is only US$962 per year. Yet in the United States, where the average income is about US$67,000, the Trump administration proposes to reduce the number of refugees that are allowed in to just 50,000. What's more, the administration's Travel Ban, which took effect on July 13, has left thousands of vulnerable refugee families who were already due to be resettled in the US, stuck in a perilous limbo.\n\nThe average Ugandan earns 20 times less than the average European citizen, yet when one million refugees from war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq arrived in Europe in 2015, the response from too many political leaders was to build walls and fences to try and keep them out, rather than welcoming them to safety.\n\n\"Despite unbelievable challenges, Uganda has shown leadership and compassion on the issue of refugees. We hope this can serve as a teaching moment for every country, especially the United States as the administration threatens to break away from the long bipartisan tradition of helping refugees,\" Miliband said.\n\nTo download b-roll and photos of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda: https://rescue.box.com/s/jjtfsxr33oqdafs6qam1ze8sz84t0jrt", "id": "9657341", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Refugees: Uganda's Leadership puts US, European Policies to Shame", "image": "https://www.rescue.org/sites/all/themes/ng/images/og-image-logo-wide-us.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 14, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 29}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1740, "date": "2017-08-04", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1748}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 2550, "date": "2017-07-13", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2557}, {"textStart": 301, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 310}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "id": "305287", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "id": "308702", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}, "id": "310451", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}, "id": "310452", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Miliband"}, "id": "375823", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miliband"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Rescue Committee"}, "id": "398457", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 11, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "09:55:00"}

Since 2013, the civil war in the world's newest country has created the continent's largest refugee crisis. The once-bustling South Sudanese border town of Bidi was \"largely abandoned last year\" when rebels attacked pro-government forces near Juba, EU Observer reported in May, and \"warring factions indiscriminately targeted\" civilians. Roughly one-sixth of South Sudan's 12 million people have fled their country.\n\nUganda's Bidi Bidi refugee settlement holds more than 250,000 people, but chronic underfunding has compromised critical life-saving help, the United Nations said in March. Uganda's generous refugee policy has been \"among the most progressive anywhere on the African continent,\" the refugee agency pointed out, with refugees receiving small plots of land in settlements that are integrated into the local host community.\n\nTabu Sunday, a 14-year-old South Sudanese refugee, was chosen as the symbolic one millionth refugee in Uganda, the UNHCR announced. Tabu traveled with her aunt, twin sister, and brother from her hometown of Yei to the Imvepi settlement in northern Uganda. Fighting has intensified since South Sudanese pro-government Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces killed 114 people around Yei between July 2016 and January 2017, Reuters reported in May.\n\n\"Where I was living they were killing people,\" Tabu told UNHCR, explaining that her parents had sent her to uganda so that she and her sister could continue to go to school. \"My parents said they didn't have enough money for travelling. So we had to walk on foot with my aunt.\"\n\nFor Tabu and her sister, they now live in a settlement where they've been given a 30-metre-square plot of land, the allotment for all refugee families when they arrive. She wants to stay in Uganda so that she can continue attending school and one day hopes to become a doctor, a dream that may only be made possible outside of South Sudan.\n\n\"I want to be a doctor because when someone falls sick, or a woman needs to deliver a baby, I can help,\" Tabu said.\n\nTabu may be one of the luckier ones arriving in Uganda. But the road ahead is still difficult and life will continue to be unstable. Once South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda, they face innumerable challenges like a shortage of food, water, and -- for young children -- class overcrowding in schools. Uganda, one of the poorest countries in the world, has only received a quarter of the $569 million needed to host refugees. The funding gap has meant that major infrastructure projects have been stalled, resulting in no electricity in health clinics, an East African-based journalist wrote in June for the Washington Post.\n\n\"The number of hungry and displaced South Sudanese is overwhelming,\" the International Committee of the Red Cross President Peter Maurer said in a statement. \"The staggering scale of suffering is evidence of the cumulative effect of 3.5 years of a style of fighting that appears calibrated to maximize misery.

More than anything they need peace at home. South Sudan's neighboring countries and the international community must honor their commitments to get South Sudan's warring parties back to the negotiating table. Until then, it will not be safe for South Sudanese refugees to return home, forcing them to depend on aid across the border.\n\n\"Uganda's open-door policy to refugees has provided protection for one million South Sudanese. This is the third-largest population of refugees in the world. Yet Uganda is one of the most under-funded host nations. If the international community does not increase support to Uganda's refugee response it could quickly buckle and fail. Donor governments must urgently release funds critical in supporting refugees with life-saving aid, and long-term support for those who have already fled their country. \"\n\nBackground\n\nThe South Sudan refugee response in Uganda and across the region is severely underfunded. In Uganda, of the UN appeal for $673million this year, only 17 per cent has been received so far. At the recent Refugee Solidarity Summit the Government of Uganda appealed for $2billion to meet the humanitarian and development needs of all refugees in the country. Less than a quarter was pledged towards this with just $431.1million committed.\n\nThe vast majority of refugees - 86 per cent - are women and children who need specific support to keep them safe from rape, beatings, torture, hunger and abandonment.\n\nUganda is also a host country for refugees from DRC, Burundi, and CAR.\n\nThere are 1.94 million internally displaced people in South Sudan. 1 in 3 people have been forced from their home since December 2013. Almost 6 million people are in need of emergency aid. Oxfam is working from 10 bases across the country to get food, water and hygiene items to people. We have been working in Panyijar County, which is where many people from the famine-affected areas have fled. Oxfam is providing vouchers for canoes so that people sheltering from the conflict on islands in the swamps can get to the help they need. To help prevent diseases like cholera Oxfam is providing clean water, safe sanitation facilities and essential hygiene items. In South Sudan, Oxfam has provided regular emergency food distributions to over 415,000 people since February.\n\nRelated Oxfam Link\n\nhttps://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/refugees", "id": "9717727", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Uganda Faces World's Fastest Growing Refugee Crisis - Kansas City infoZine", "image": "http://www.infozine.com/news/images/articles/17/08/2_66785_1502977534.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1997, "date": "2013-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2010}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Burundi"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "23", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Burundi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "39", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "id": "305935", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}, "id": "315520", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cholera"}, "id": "325379", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central Africa"}, "id": "333920", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oxfam"}, "id": "371348", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics of Uganda"}, "id": "496271", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Uganda"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 11, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "15:09:00"}

She hopes to be able to set up a small business, so that she can get some necessary household items that she would otherwise not be able to buy. \"I hope we can get some support to be able to start making an income, so that we can depend on ourselves, and not the humanitarian assistance, in the future. That would be much better,\" she explains.\n\nOne million South Sudanese have fled for their lives across Uganda's border seeking safety since the start of the war in 2013. About a third of this number arrived since January 2017, highlighting that conflict continues to rage in South Sudan.\n\nFamilies crossing the border report that the security situation in South Sudan is deteriorating. Fear of indiscriminate killing, ethnically motivated attacks, torture, looting and burning of homes, and forced recruitment of young people by armed groups are some of the reasons people say they flee. Many newly arrived women and girls report being survivors of rape, according to the UN's refugee agency. 1,800 South Sudanese have crossed the border on average each day over the past year. Many travel for several days through the bush, afraid of armed groups who have reportedly set up road blocks on main roads to the border.\n\n\"Families are escaping a living hell in South Sudan. The stories they tell us when they arrive are truly horrific,\" said Muhumed Hussein, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Country Director for Uganda. \"The war in South Sudan continues to rage. The arrival of the one millionth South Sudanese fleeing to Uganda is testament to this.\"\n\nThe situation in South Sudan is dire, three and a half years into the war. Half the population - 6 million people - do not have enough to eat. Although famine conditions recently subsided in Leer and Mayendit counties thanks to humanitarian assistance, the number of people on the brink of famine has increased to 1.7 million. The spread of cholera is compounding the situation. Close to 18,000 cases have been confirmed since the country's worst outbreak began about year ago. Over 320 people have died so far.\n\n\"South Sudan is the world's fastest growing refugee crisis. It will likely stay that way until the security situation changes and they no longer feel they have to flee. The barbaric violence endemic in this war guarantees it,\" said Hussein.\n\nThe situation in Uganda offers respite to families fleeing the brutal conflict. But with more than half a million refugees from South Sudan crossing into Uganda over the last year, and more arriving everyday, the country's resources are strained.\n\nFor example, Bidi Bidi, which was a small village just 9 months ago, has grown into one of the world's largest refugee settlements with over 272,000 inhabitants. This is equal to the whole population of Newcastle in the United Kingdom.\n\nDespite immense needs and new refugees arriving daily, the response operation to the influx is only about 21 per cent funded. More funding is needed in education and learning for children and youths. Eighty-five per cent of the refugee population are children and women.\n\nFunding also needs to be flexible and provided on a multi-year basis so that aid agencies can plan long-term livelihood projects, to reduce refugees' dependency on food handouts. Additional resources should also be put into educating refugees and host communities about their legal rights, so that they can better mitigate conflict and live side-by-side more peacefully.", "id": "9635849", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Today marks 1 million South Sudanese fleeing to Uganda", "image": "http://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-square.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 762, "date": "2017-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 774}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Torture"}, "id": "304940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "id": "305935", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Endemism"}, "id": "322596", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cholera"}, "id": "325379", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"}, {"label": {"eng": "Norwegian Refugee Council"}, "id": "385674", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Refugee_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "European migrant crisis"}, "id": "1269257", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sudanese in Israel"}, "id": "1283221", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_in_Israel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "07:52:00"}

Only 21 percent of the $674 million required to care for the refugees in Uganda has been received, and UNHCR has called for greater commitment from donors.\n\nUNHCR/Peter Caton\n\nThe millionth South Sudanese refugee to arrive in Uganda\n\nSouth Sudan has effectively been at war since December 2013, when political tensions within the newly independent government triggered fighting between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his former vice president, Riek Machar, who heads the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO)\n\nRegional governments tried to paper over the cracks and imposed a power-sharing settlement, known as the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, or ARCSS. But it lasted only a few months before government forces attacked Machar (who had finally returned to Juba) in July 2016.\n\nThe regional eight-country Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, is looking to revive ARCSS but is finding little enthusiasm, including among Western powers that had helped bankroll the process.\n\nIn a communique in June, IGAD argued that \"full implementation of ARCSS remains the only viable way forward to bring about peace and stability and create the basis for a democratic political system in South Sudan.\"\n\nBut the first stumbling block is agreement on whether Machar, in exile in South Africa, should be part of the process. The government is championing Taban Deng Gai, who was sworn in as vice president last year, as the rightful leader of SPLA-IO.\n\n\"We are for peace,\" said Paul Gabriel Lam, deputy spokesman for Machar's SPLA-IO faction. \"But as long as Riek Machar is in South Africa, we will continue having problems in South Sudan,\" he told IRIN.\n\n\"Bad joke\"\n\nFor most analysts, the problems surrounding a revamped ARCSS go deeper than whether Machar, a veteran warlord, has a seat at the table.\n\n\"This 'revitalisation process' is a bad joke,\" Mike Brand, a genocide prevention expert at Jewish World Watch, told IRIN. \"I don't think there is any hope the ARCSS can be revitalised as it is structurally inadequate to address the current drivers of conflict.\"\n\nSouth Sudan is an unfinished state that needs both reconciliation and true nation-building.\n\nThere are no stable institutions. Basic social services are provided by foreign aid workers, and since independence in 2011, the security sector has never been professionalised, nor properly integrated.\n\n\"The country went from a factionalised group of independent militaries fighting a common enemy [the north] to a 'unified' government built on a patronage system supported by a policy of kleptocracy,\" said Brand.\n\nResearcher Alan Boswell agreed. \"South Sudan is broken at its most fundamental level: What is South Sudan? Who is entitled to rule it? These are questions that South Sudanese have never sat down and negotiated or decided.\"\n\nThe last peace deal \"pushed for power-sharing and competitive politics simultaneously among armed parties,\" he told IRIN. \"It was destined to explode, and it did. The peace deal is obsolete and was mad to begin with.\"\n\nRachel Jacob at Max Security Solutions, a geopolitical risk consulting firm, said any future peace deal \"must be more inclusive. [But] this effort is not being made.\"\n\nAtrocities\n\nThere is instead a pervasive culture of impunity, which fuels recurring cycles of violence and mass atrocities.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned the government and opposition for failing to stop civilian killings, rape, and forced displacement.\n\nIn its latest report, it says nine men - including Kiir, Machar, former army chief of staff Paul Malong, and six other commanders - should be investigated and, if culpable, prosecuted for the grave rights violations.\n\n\"Fighting has spread to all regions of South Sudan and shows no signs of abating, nor is that likely so as long as the incentives to pursue military solutions remain unchanged, particularly for the government,\" said Kate Almquist Knopf, director of the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at National Defense University, Washington.\n\nThe war is not only generating a refugee crisis felt by neighbouring countries, but it has also displaced internally close to two million people, and left 5.8 million in need of aid - aid that is increasingly being used to perpetuate the fighting.\n\n\"The time has come for the international community to hold perpetrators accountable for the misery they have inflicted upon their country and the deadly conflict they continue to wage without justification or remorse,\" said Juliette Paauwe at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect.\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe sad fact, noted Brand, is that the international community is \"flat out of new ideas to bring peace to South Sudan.\" But the bottom line is that neither Kiir nor Machar \"can lead South Sudan to peace\".\n\nSouth Sudan is falling apart. \"All sides keep getting weaker and the pieces become more and more difficult to put back together,\" said Boswell.\n\n\"The previous peace deal expanded the war nationally and further fragmented the country. Building on top of its rubble is a terrible, dangerous idea,\" he added. \"The whole process needs to start over. The whole approach must change.\"\n\nThe way forward is a new peace plan that does not solely focus on a bilateral agreement between Kiir and Machar, argued Jacob at Max Security Solutions.\n\n\"It must recognise that there are many more important political and military actors who must participate in order for any peace process to succeed,\" she added.\n\nPhil Clark, a Great Lakes expert at SOAS, University of London, made a similar case.\n\n\"A major issue neglected by the ARCSS was community level reconciliation. A new process needs to address long-standing grievances at the local level,\" he told IRIN.\n\n\"Much of the violence is being committed by militias and community perpetrators - in addition to the national army - and any comprehensive response must address conflicts between different local groups.\"\n\nKnopf offered a more radical solution. As direct impediments to an effective peace settlement, Kiir and Machar must be persuaded by the international community to stand down.\n\nReferencing an old and controversial idea of a UN or African Union trusteeship for South Sudan, Knopf saw this approach as enabling a justice and reconciliation processes to unfold, and for a national consensus to form over how South Sudanese wish to be governed.\n\n\"The international community has helped other countries come out of vicious conflict through various forms of temporary external administration - South Sudan deserves no less,\" she said.", "id": "9860371", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "South Sudan: A War Without End - Neighbours Carry the Burden of Fleeing Millions", "image":

The vast majority -- 86% -- are women and children. As thousands arrived each day with the few possessions they could carry, Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in northern Uganda soon became the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nUganda could have tried to keep the refugees out, regarding them as a potential burden on a still-developing country. Instead, Uganda and Ugandans embraced the refugees as brothers and sisters who need help and a chance to start a new life somewhere safe. In doing so, they also embraced opportunity: Refugees can bring real economic benefits to their new countries.\n\nOne place that embodies this spirit of welcome -- and opportunity -- is Quality Restaurant in Bidi Bidi, where Zulu Likichio is proud to count South Sudanese newcomers among her employees and customers.\n\nBefore the war, Zulu, a widow from Uganda, ran a restaurant in South Sudan to support her children. At that time it wasn't unusual for people from both countries to cross the border each day to go to work. With support from the International Rescue Committee, Zulu rebuilt her business in Bidi Bidi, starting out by catering meals for aid workers who were helping the refugees. \"When I first came here, it was not easy for me,\" she recalls.\n\nAlthough Zulu had to start out small, she is glad her new restaurant and the employment opportunities it provides have given refugees in Bidi Bidi a chance to settle into their new home. For Zulu, hiring refugees alongside local Ugandans was the obvious thing to do -- six of her employees are South Sudanese, \"When I saw the refugees, I couldn't refuse them,\" she says. \"They have their financial issues and their problems -- so that is why I employ them.\"\n\nToday Quality Restaurant is thriving, with Zulu and her staff of 15 preparing and serving grilled meat, chapati bread, rice, plantains, sweet potatoes and other dishes popular with customers from both Uganda and South Sudan. Mulondo Ssenkaali, who oversees IRC programs in Bidi Bidi, says the restaurant has even become a local social center. \"Refugees come and eat here, so it's the real meeting point between the two communities.\"\n\nUgandans still remember the warm welcome their South Sudanese neighbors gave them when they had to flee a war in their own country years ago. \"The community here hates to call these people refugees,\" Mulondo says. \"They call these people brothers and sisters.\" Unlike many countries that accept refugees, Uganda allows the newcomers to move freely, find jobs and work, and resettle on government-granted land.\n\nQuality Restaurant has become a welcome respite for the refugees in Bidi Bidi, a place where they can relax after their harrowing escape from war and finally feel like their lives are getting back to normal.\n\nAs a small business owner, Zulu has seen firsthand that when refugees are able to work they contribute their skills to the labor market, become self-sufficient and spend money that stimulates the local economy. And a growing body of research shows that refugees provide other economic benefits to the countries and communities that welcome them, including by starting their own businesses and creating jobs.\n\nAs the war in South Sudan rages on, the IRC is helping refugees in Uganda to rebuild their lives by supporting local businesses like Zulu's and providing emergency cash relief to the most vulnerable refugees. We are also providing lifesaving protection, health care and nutrition services, as well as women's empowerment support, to the refugees and to South Sudanese families trapped by violence inside their country.", "id": "9690163", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A taste of welcome in Uganda", "image": "https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/styles/window_width_breakpoints_theme_rescue_large_2x/public/article/1808/teaser/kr_uganda_may2017-4300_rev.jpg?itok=RqOpMBRT&timestamp=1502972641", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 157, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 166}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bread"}, "id": "304829", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sweet potato"}, "id": "320757", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chapati"}, "id": "342612", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cooking plantain"}, "id": "356177", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_plantain"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Rescue Committee"}, "id": "398457", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "12:51:00"}

Over 600,000 children require sustained humanitarian assistance to survive and continued access to education and psychosocial support.\n\nIn a report released earlier in the year, Save the Children warned of the risk of refugee South Sudanese children missing out on education at this critical time in their lives. Inadequate funding for education coupled with challenges in accessing food, water and basic nutrition make the situation for refugee children desperate.\n\nChildren from South Sudan are also grappling with trauma from the conflict and separation from parents and loved ones. Through the report, Save the Children shared a detailed plan to restore hope, and rebuild futures for the refugee children of South Sudan in Uganda, through education. While at the same time, strengthening the support systems for refugee host communities, who are in great need as well.\n\n\"Children face many risks both on the way to Uganda and in the refugee settlements. They need protection and psychosocial support, as well as health services and education. The current response is dramatically underfunded and requires integrated planning to ensure education for all refugee children,\" says Brechtje van Lith, Save the Children's Country Director in Uganda.\n\nFighting broke out in Juba, South Sudan's capital in July 2016 and has continued to force thousands of people out of the young country. These have sought refuge in neighbouring Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya, citing insecurity, indiscriminate killing, sexual violence, looting of property and livestock and famine as reasons for flight. The majority of those fleeing have been women and children, with separated and unaccompanied children recorded in high numbers.\n\nUganda is hosting the refugees in resettlement camps spread across the West Nile region of the country, and has this month opened the latest such camp, Omugo, in Arua district. Currently, Uganda hosts close to 1.5 million refugees - over 1 million from South Sudan alone with others hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Burundi.\n\nDespite the pressure of this unprecedented influx, Uganda has maintained its refugee welcoming policy, keeping its borders open and continuing to provide refugees with land, shelter, freedom of movement and access to services. The numbers of refugees are overwhelming and show little sign of abating.\n\nTo address this, the international community must redouble efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the crisis in South Sudan. There should be increased support and resourcing to the effective implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees and the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, sharing responsibilities and meeting the needs of host and displaced communities. Critically, while ensuring that refugee children continue to have access to basic services, it is vital that they also continue with their education and are supported to overcome the psychosocial effects of conflict and displacement.\n\nSave the Children's response to the South Sudanese refugee crisis\n\nSave the Children supports family tracing and reunification, seeking to reunite children with family members they have been separated from. Save the Children also finds foster parents for the children who've fled to Uganda on their own. In addition, Save the Children runs child-friendly spaces in the settlements, so children have a safe place to play, and to ensure our child protection teams can monitor their well-being and help them recover a sense of normalcy. Save the Children offers early childhood care and development for young children (3-6 years of age), as well as catch-up education classes for children who have dropped out of primary school, to ensure children are engaged in education and connect them to livelihood opportunities. Save the Children also runs health clinics and nutrition programmes.", "id": "9865564", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Children fight for survival as number of South Sudanese Refugees in Uganda hits the One million mark", "image": "http://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-square.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 9, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 26}, {"textStart": 1535, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1544}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Burundi"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "23", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Burundi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "39", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "114", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "207", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "6814", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala", "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Arua"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "6873", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arua", "label": {"eng": "Arua"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "312048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba", "label": {"eng": "Juba"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "319140", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile", "label": {"eng": "Nile"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Save the Children Australia"}, "id": "319214", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Children"}, {"label": {"eng": "Child protection"}, "id": "324254", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection"}, {"label": {"eng": "South Sudanese Civil War"}, "id": "357673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "European migrant crisis"}, "id": "1269257", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 801, "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1014, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1313, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Children's Museums", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/Children's_Museums"}], "time": "09:50:00"}

Last summe,r Bidibidi did not exist. It is now home to the world's largest refugee camp, with 272,000 South Sudanese living within a sprawling, dusty landscape about 40 kilometres south of the South Sudan border\n\nEarlier this summer, South Sudan marked the sixth anniversary of its independence from Sudan. But with a civil war and ethnic violence generating the worst food crisis in the world today, there was little reason to celebrate in the world's newest country.\n\nThe situation in South Sudan is desperate. Ethnic cleansing of entire villages and horrific violence has caused families to flee into the bush. Meanwhile, farmers have been forced off their land, roads have been blockaded and the market system has been crippled, creating massive man-made food shortages that get little attention in the rest of the world.\n\nUganda has opened its border with South Sudan to welcome refugees fleeing the violence and food insecurity.\n\n\"The people have been coming for about nine or 10 months,\" said Michael Messenger, president of World Vision Canada, a Christian nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides emergency aid and longer-term development assistance to people in need in the developing world.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine, really, that there are about one million South Sudanese refugees who have come across the border into northern Uganda in that period of time,\" Messenger said of the massive influx of refugees.\n\nEarlier this summer, Messenger travelled to northern Uganda, visiting the Bidibidi Refugee Resettlement in Arua. The settlement is currently home to 270,000 South Sudanese refugees.\n\nResilient refugees\n\nWhat was the physical condition of the refugees Messenger met at BidiBidi?\n\n\"They are incredibly resilient,\" Messenger said of the displaced South Sudanese. They have been through so much. In some ways, they are quite stoic.\n\n\"They've been through so much, for so many years in their own country,\" Messenger continued. \"Now they try to find some measure of security in northern Uganda.\n\n\"People were in all kinds of conditions, honestly,\" said Messenger, who noted that every refugee is assessed for health concerns when they arrive at the refugee settlement. \"They are flagged if they are noticeably malnourished or if they have a disability or some kind of special need.\"\n\nAnd World Vision is especially concerned about child refugees, including unaccompanied minors, he added.\n\nThe phenomenon of unaccompanied children is \"one of the biggest stories in this overall tragedy,\" Messenger said. Approximately 10,000 children have crossed into northern Uganda. And the World Vision boss wants Canadians to understand the significance and enormity of the problem.\n\n\"In Canada, when one child wanders away at a shopping mall or is at risk of being taken, an Amber Alert goes across the province,\" he said. \"We take that completely seriously.\n\n\"Imagine that times 10,000 children,\" he said of the separation of South Sudanese children from their families in northern Uganda. \"This really is a children's crisis; 69 per cent of refugees in northern Uganda are children. These are the innocent ones. They are the ones that need our help.\"\n\nStory of the exodus\n\nDid the refugees Messenger met in northern Uganda talk about genocide or personal security concerns?\n\n\"Most of the story was what they had left behind and the tragic circumstances that caused them to leave,\" he recalled.\n\nMost fled South Sudan for one of two reasons: famine or conflict. However, Messenger said that the main driver of the exodus was the civil war in South Sudan.\n\n\"Lots of people told us stories of having their village attacked by rebels. We heard some pretty challenging stories of trauma, especially from kids,\" Messenger said.\n\nWhat was the emotional and psychological state of the displaced people Messenger met?\n\n\"It's pretty significant for a family to uproot themselves from everything they know and are comfortable with: language, culture, geography, home,\" Messenger replied. \"It has to be a pretty dire situation to take everyone to flee through the bush to an unknown land. These people have been through a lot.\"\n\nRefugee settlement\n\n\"Uganda has one of the most compassionate, open refugee policies in the world,\" Messenger declared.\n\nHe pointed out that the BidiBidi Refugee Resettlement is not a traditional refugee camp where people live in rows of tents such as in Jordan, which has taken in many Syrian refugees.\n\n\"Each refugee's family is given a plot of land, usually 50 metres by 50 metres, and some building materials,\" he said of the refugee settlement in northern Uganda. \"Some people have put up huts, using tarpaulins and poles. Those who have been there a little bit longer are actually beginning to build mud huts, mud dwellings that are more typical in South Sudan.\n\n\"So they are committed to trying to squeeze every bit of life they can out of the meagre spaces provided to them,\" Messenger said. For example, many refugees plant vegetables such as maize, tomatoes, gourds and cabbage to supplement the basic food aid provided by World Vision and the World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThere was a report from International Christian Response in June that food rations for refugees in northern Uganda had been drastically reduced. Messenger confirmed that the amount of food supplied to the refugees had to be temporarily reduced due to problems in the WFP supply chain. \"The good news is that it has gone back up,\" he said of food rations, noting that such reductions tend to be cyclical.\n\n\"World Vision is supporting 660,000 people, distributing the food once a month in that whole area in conjunction with the World Food Programme,\" he said. \"It's a huge logistical operation to try to get these goods in.\"\n\nIt is hard for refugee families to live on what humanitarian NGOs provide. \"Families were telling us that they could not feed their children on the amount of rations that were available to them,\" during the rations reduction, Messenger stated. \"Which is one of the reasons why they are doing all they can to plant during the [growing] season, so they can begin to get additional vegetables to supplement the other food that is received. It's pretty basic.\"\n\nFamine eases\n\nEven though South Sudan is no longer officially in a state of famine, should Canadians still be concerned about the food crisis?\n\n\"Absolutely, they should,\" Messenger answered. \"In fact, the label of famine just talks about an extreme. At the moment, in the area of South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, parts of Nigeria, there are between 22 and 25 million people who are at risk of starvation.\n\n\"Whether they are in famine or not does not take away that risk. We need to be every bit as vigilant, doing all that we can to get all the resources there as possible.\"\n\nMessenger says that it is \"good news\" that conditions have improved enough to lift the famine declaration for some parts of South Sudan. \"But that does not mean the people are out of danger. And, in fact, we're concerned that it could just be cyclical thing. There could be other provinces that may dip into famine if we aren't diligent as an international community.\"\n\nAccording to Messenger, \"organizations like World Vision rely on the support of Canadians just to do our work.\" And he warned that if the world does not remain vigilant and support humanitarian relief efforts, NGOs won't be able to deliver \"desperately needed life-giving food and water and shelter to people in need.\"\n\nChildren at risk\n\nAre children under the age of five especially vulnerable to the impacts of foot shortages?\n\n\"Absolutely they are,\" Messenger answered. \"Malnutrition is such a critical issue for children.\"\n\nWhen it comes to child and maternal health, the World Vision president said that the first 1,000 days, \"from conception right through to the age of five,\" are critical in the life of a child.\n\n\"This is the time when if children don't get basic necessary food -- healthy, balanced -- then they are at risk of long-term developmental issues,\" he said. \"That could include cognitive issues if the brain doesn't develop properly. We see evidence where there is malnutrition of stunting -- children who are smaller in stature than they should be.\"\n\nChild and maternal health are top priorities for World Vision. \"Helping mothers of young children in particular to get the food that they need, because that really starts them along the path of life,\" Messenger said. \"It is a critical intervention.\"\n\nDonor fatigue\n\nIn a world rife with conflict and corruption and escalating food crises, donor fatigue threatens humanitarian efforts to raise funds to help those in need. Why should Canadians give money to help with relief efforts in South Sudan and Uganda?\n\n\"That's both an easy and hard question to answer,\" Messenger said. \"The easy thing is that there are people in need who are created in God's image, the same way that I am. We believe we have the opportunity to be generous. As a country, we have so much to be able to provide to those in need.\"\n\nMessenger also offered a more \"pragmatic\" answer. \"It's to our benefit to ensure that countries like South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen are stable and prosperous. It helps our security. It helps the things we are concerned about in the world right now: instability.\"\n\nIt is important to remember, Messenger said, that a five-year-old child is a victim of circumstances beyond his or her control.\n\n\"Children didn't start [the] wars,\" he said. \"They aren't causing corruption. They are living in a world where environmental issues are increasingly challenging, so we see the effects of famine and erratic rainfalls and change in weather patterns. This has nothing to do with corruption.\n\n\"We see issues of conflict, yes, but in the midst of those waging war, we see innocent victims. We need to reach out and provide support to them.\"\n\nMessenger is concerned that \"big numbers\" and staggering statistics about starving people \"all becomes a blur.\" But he remains \"deeply committed to trying to get this word out, and do all I can to try and encourage Canadians to continue to care, because it's making a difference in the lives of children.\"\n\n\"We have the opportunity to help out in one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time,\" Messenger said.\n\nSolutions\n\nWhat are the short- and long-term solutions to the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan?\n\n\"Short term, we need to give children and families in the refugee camps or who are on the move or suffering from famine the kind of things they need to survive,\" Messenger replied. \"That is nutritious food, clean potable water, a place to stay, a place to be safe and secure.\"\n\nOn average, refugees are displaced for seven to 10 years around the world, Messenger said.\n\nIn the longer term, he contends that \"we have to move from a handout to a hand up\" when providing humanitarian assistance to refugees. \"And we need to try to find not just ways of giving food on a regular basis, but how can we work with both the refugees and the host communities who have welcomed them in northern Uganda.\"\n\nFor example, international assistance should foster economic opportunities for refugees and host communities. \"We are experimenting with cash-based transfers to try to provide tools so that people can work together to farm,\" Messenger said. \"It's likely that people who are in northern Uganda are going to be there for some time.\"\n\nHowever, the ultimate solution to the refugee crisis is to bring peace to South Sudan, he declared. \"We need a concerted, focused international effort to bring the parties who are in conflict in South Sudan to the table to address the issues together.\n\n\"South Sudan started in a burst of optimism, the newest democracy on the planet. And unfortunately, it's just sunk to a situation of cultural and ethnic tension and conflict. It's really sad to see. We just need to stand up in the international community and say, 'this can't continue.'\"\n\nHumanitarian appeal\n\n\"There is a gap between what is needed on the ground today and what we can provide,\" Messenger said of the dire situation in South Sudan. \"The needs are so great.\n\n\"I appeal to Canadians to continue to be generous. Even a small amount can make a huge difference when we work together.\"", "id": "9768610", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Helping refugees recover", "image": "http://storage.thewhig.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297983378320_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1502999130012", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "37", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "164", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "207", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "Genocide"}, "id": "304451", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}, "id": "305250", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Famine"}, "id": "306097", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "id": "308702", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}, "id": "309893", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}, "id": "310451", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}, "id": "310452", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Vision International"}, "id": "316111", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aid"}, "id": "318692", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}, "id": "319038", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}, "id": "331636", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 11, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1014, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1051, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Chat", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Chat"}], "time": "20:04:00"}

Harriet noticed her own four children playing with Tabu, her twin sister Rena and 11-year-old brother Emmanuel, who appeared to have no-one to care for them, and took them under her wing.\n\nTabu and her siblings had fled fighting in their home town of Yei with their aunt. Her parents sent them to Uganda so that the girls could continue to go to school.\n\n\"Where I was living they were killing people,\" she said. \"My parents said they didn't have enough money for travelling. So we had to walk on foot with my aunt.\n\n\"It was a long and hard journey. We had to use the Congo route to reach Uganda. My aunt stayed for a week and decided to return home.\n\n\"After she left, we were playing with our foster parents' children and their mother saw we were alone. She requested that we stay with her, here in her home.\"\n\nHome for Tabu is a 30-metre-square plot of land, which is given to all refugee families when they arrive. Tabu and her siblings lives in a separate building from their foster family, which gives the youngsters privacy to sleep, read and study.\n\nIn a statement, UNHCR, notes that an average of more than 1,800 South Sudanese refugees a day have fled to Uganda in the past year. The influx has become the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. More than 85 per cent of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda are women and children under the age of 18.\n\nHowever, it said that despite, hosting a Solidarity Summit in June, the agency had received just 21 per cent of the US$674 million needed to support the South Sudanese refugees in Uganda for 2017.\n\nIn addition to the million refugees now hosted by Uganda, a million or even more South Sudanese refugees are being hosted by Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic.\n\n\"With the crisis currently showing no end in sight, decisive action is required and there is an urgent need for pledges of support to be fulfilled,\" the statement added.\n\nUganda deserves praise for maintaining open borders to refugees and for its progressive approach to asylum.\n\n\"With the crisis currently showing no end in sight, decisive action is required.\"\n\nIt provides refugees with land on which to build a shelter and grow crops, gives them freedom of movement and the right to work, and grants them access to public services such as health care and education.\n\nTall, slim and energetic, Tabu likes to help her foster mother by weeding their small vegetable garden, washing clothes and cooking dishes of millet and beans.\n\nShe is a dedicated student and wants to stay in Uganda so she can carry on attending school. \"I'm in primary five and my favourite subjects are religious education and mathematics,\" she says.\n\nHowever, she finds it a struggle with more than 200 students in her class. \"When the teacher is teaching others are making noise and we don't get what they are teaching.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Tabu is determined to learn and spends much of her free time doing homework. She and her siblings believe a good education will help them achieve their dreams. Tabu's sister, Rena, hopes to become a mayor and their brother, Emmanuel, wants to be a pilot.\n\nTabu has her sights set on medicine. \"I want to be a doctor because when someone falls sick, or a woman needs to deliver a baby, I can help.\"", "id": "9613386", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "South Sudanese refugees in Uganda now exceed 1 million", "image": "http://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/598dc51a4.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "39", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "40", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic", "label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "114", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Yei"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "10854", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yei,_South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Yei"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}, "id": "308095", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Millet"}, "id": "374794", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tabu (actress)"}, "id": "548406", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_(actress)"}, {"label": {"eng": "European migrant crisis"}, "id": "1269257", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}], "time": "05:05:00"}

Then, it was vast bushland overrun with wildlife. Now it's a sprawling, bustling quasi-town, with 300km of roads and home to 272,000 people, making it the largest refugee camp in the world.\n\nAnd it's surrounded by camps of rivalling size, all bursting with people forced to leave their entire lives behind and run. The UN announced this week that Uganda is now hosting more than one million South Sudanese refugees, and that's on top of the three million who are either internally displaced or spread across countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan.\n\nMore than half of them are children, many of whom lost their parents along the way, or even saw them ruthlessly killed right in front of them. It's been a brutal conflict, with thousands of untold tragedies.\n\nI spent a week in northern Uganda last month - hearing first hand of the treacherous journeys these refugees undertook. Running through the bush at night and hiding during the day; constantly living in fear of ambush and that this day would be their last. Bodies piling up by the side of the road, loved ones having no time to bury them.\n\nIn Imvepi refugee settlement, a couple of hours' drive from Bidi Bidi, I met James. At just 13 years old, he already knows all too well the horrors of war.\n\nHe and his younger brothers, Stephen and David, fled South Sudan last year after their parents were killed in the conflict. They were taken in by a neighbour, but he refused to leave when the fighting intensified.\n\nJames believed it was the best possible chance of survival for he and his brothers, so he decided they would go alone. They packed only one small bag each, and ran.\n\nIt's impossible to imagine the burden of that decision on someone so young. To take responsibility for his brothers, while still just a child himself.\n\nThankfully, James, Stephen and David were looked after by World Vision when they arrived in Uganda, and now live with a foster family who also fled South Sudan. It's an unbelievable act of generosity, and one of many glimmers of hope in the midst of this forgotten crisis.\n\nEva lost her mother and brother when they were ambushed by rebels on their journey to Uganda. Then, she was raped - and at just 16 years old is now four months pregnant. She doesn't know how she'll cope when the baby arrives; she already sells a portion of her food rations to help pay for necessities for her eight-year-old sister. When I asked if there was anything she needed, Eva asked for soap and books - \"to keep my mind safe\".\n\nMy heart broke. Here was a young girl whose short life has already been marred by horror, and all she wanted was to be able to wash her clothes, and escape for a little while. The injustice of her situation was overwhelming.\n\nBut Eva, too, is being looked after by World Vision staff, who regularly visit her and are hoping to get her back into school. There's a long road ahead, but her future is already starting to look more hopeful.\n\nIt's thanks to the tireless work of government and NGO staff on the ground that children like James and Eva have a chance of a normal life one day. The generosity of Ugandans stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric we hear so often here in the West. While we build fences to keep refugees out, Uganda welcomes those fleeing with open arms and the promise of safety. It's a sobering comparison. Especially so, given that Uganda's resources - already limited - are being stretched to breaking point.\n\nBidi Bidi's commandant, Robert Baryamwesiga, summed up the heart behind Uganda's open-handedness when I met him at his small, humble office on the outskirts of the settlement.\n\n\"Refugees are people. They deserve to be treated like human beings,\" he said.\n\nWhile Uganda struggles with the reality of accommodating more than a million arrivals from South Sudan, its priority remains simple, human dignity. And for that, the world should sit up and take note.\n\nFind out more about the South Sudan refugee crisis, and how you can help, here.", "id": "9880750", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "One Million Refugees.

As many as 85 percent of those reaching Uganda recount horrific tales of seeing armed groups burning villagers alive in their houses, shooting people in front of their families, raping women and girls, and seizing boys to serve as conscripts, the United Nations reported.\n\nThe villagers often travel for days through the bush to avoid indiscriminate killings by the marauding armed groups, which have set up checkpoints on the roads.\n\nHundreds have escaped to South Sudan's other neighbors -- notably Sudan and Ethiopia -- where, the refugee agency said, an additional 1 million have sought shelter. Two million more have been driven from their homes for other reasons, the agency said.\n\nSouth Sudan became the world's newest nation in 2011, when it declared its independence after five decades of guerrilla warfare and the loss of 2 million lives. Civil war erupted four years ago, after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar. The move set off bloody confrontations between their supporters and rival ethnic groups. The bloodshed has escalated and intensified in the past year, with a sharp rise in ethnically targeted killings and sexual violence.\n\nThe United Nations started deploying 4,000 troops to South Sudan this month to bolster a peacekeeping force of 13,000, but as violence has spread, the agency has not been able to do much to protect civilians outside its bases or to prevent attacks on relief agency staff members trying to deliver humanitarian aid.\n\nRelief agencies say the fighting -- which has forced farmers to flee, disrupting the planting of crops -- and the looting of livestock has deepened economic hardship in one of Africa's poorest countries.\n\nIn June, the U.N. food agency described conditions in South Sudan as catastrophic and warned that the situation there was deteriorating, with more than 6 million people facing acute hunger. \"The number of hungry and displaced South Sudanese is overwhelming,\" Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement Thursday as he began a visit to the country.

IOM, the UN Migration Agency, has intensified its efforts to help refugees and the communities hosting them in coordination with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Since the crisis erupted in South Sudan in December 2013, nearly 4 million people have been displaced from their homes due to insecurity and rising humanitarian needs.\n\nSince April, IOM has been implementing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects in the country's West Nile region. This response targets Zone 4 of the Bidibidi settlement in the Yumbe district and the Palorinya settlement in the Moyo district. IOM's projects are assisting both refugees and Ugandans who live side by side in the settlements and share resources and common services. Bidibidi, which is home to an estimated 276,000 refugees is now considered Africa's largest refugee settlement. The Palorinya settlement hosts 176,000 refugees.\n\nThese life-saving interventions are funded by the European Commission's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid department (ECHO), and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).\n\nSince mid-2016, increasing instability and conflict throughout Central Equatoria, which borders Uganda, has led to the displacement of thousands of civilians to displacement camps, remote areas and across the border. On Thursday (17/08), UNHCR formally announced that Uganda was hosting at least 1 million South Sudanese refugees fleeing war and its effects in the world's youngest nation. Some 1,800 South Sudanese crossed the border every day into Uganda over the past 12 months, according to UNHCR.\n\nThe influx has put a strain on services such as water, healthcare and education in Uganda. In June 2017, the UN and the Uganda Government hosted the Solidarity Summit on Refugees with Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urging the international community to support Uganda's exemplary refugee protection model.\n\nThe EU has committed over EUR 2.2 million to support IOM's humanitarian operations in the country through July 2018.\n\nIOM's interventions are aimed at improving the reach, safety and sustainability of water supplies, as well as supporting construction of sanitation and hygiene facilities and promoting their usage. A major challenge is that more than 60 per cent of water is supplied by trucking, which is expensive and unsustainable. Access to sanitation and hygiene reaches 30.6 per cent of the population in Zone 4 of the Bidibidi settlement and only 6 per cent for the entire Palorinya settlement.\n\nIn the two settlements, IOM will motorize three production wells and build piped systems to deliver water to at least 31,000 people, support community water management structures and distribute thousands of jerry-cans for storing drinking water. The sanitation interventions will involve construction of at least 34 institutional latrine blocks and 7,600 household latrines, including for people with special needs. A sludge fecal treatment system, garbage collection points and incinerators will also be set up. Placenta pits and bathing shelters will be built at selected health centres.\n\nAmong other activities, IOM will also carry out awareness-creation campaigns and train refugees in hygienic practices and in manufacturing soap, sanitary pads and briquettes.\n\n\"The situation in the refugee settlements remains dire, not least because the flow of refugees into Uganda continues. Just one third of the high-yield boreholes that can be motorized to end overreliance on trucking have been adapted, so we still have a long way to go to provide sustainable safe water,\" said Ali Abdi, IOM Uganda Chief of Mission. \"And with the coverage of minimum acceptable sanitation and hygiene standards lower than 10 per cent in sites such as Palorinya, WASH services for the South Sudanese refugees couldn't be more urgent,\" said Abdi.\n\nFor more information, please contact Richard Mulindwa-Kavuma, IOM Uganda, Tel: +256 772 709 917 and +256 700 646 403, Email:

Analysts say the chances of forging peace are becoming slimmer and so the war and the flow of desperate people is set to continue, further straining an already struggling aid operation.\n\nAn average of 1,800 South Sudanese have been arriving every day in northern Uganda for the past 12 months, fleeing \"barbaric violence\", the refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a statement today.\n\nBut there are an additional \"million or even more\" South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic.\n\nThe aid operation does not have the funding in place to cope with this scale of need, \"significantly impacting the ability to deliver life-saving aid and key basic services\" - from food to health care. Only 21 percent of the $674 million required to care for the refugees in Uganda has been received, and UNHCR has called for greater commitment from donors.\n\nSouth Sudan has effectively been at war since December 2013, when political tensions within the newly independent government triggered fighting between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his former vice president, Riek Machar, who heads the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO)\n\nRegional governments tried to paper over the cracks and imposed a power-sharing settlement, known as the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, or ARCSS. But it lasted only a few months before government forces attacked Machar (who had finally returned to Juba) in July 2016.\n\nThe regional eight-country Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, is looking to revive ARCSS but is finding little enthusiasm, including among Western powers that had helped bankroll the process.\n\nIn a communique in June, IGAD argued that \"full implementation of ARCSS remains the only viable way forward to bring about peace and stability and create the basis for a democratic political system in South Sudan.\"\n\nBut the first stumbling block is agreement on whether Machar, in exile in South Africa, should be part of the process. The government is championing Taban Deng Gai, who was sworn in as vice president last year, as the rightful leader of SPLA-IO.\n\n\"We are for peace,\" said Paul Gabriel Lam, deputy spokesman for Machar's SPLA-IO faction. \"But as long as Riek Machar is in South Africa, we will continue having problems in South Sudan,\" he told IRIN.\n\nFor most analysts, the problems surrounding a revamped ARCSS go deeper than whether Machar, a veteran warlord, has a seat at the table.\n\n\"This 'revitalisation process' is a bad joke,\" Mike Brand, a genocide prevention expert at Jewish World Watch, told IRIN. \"I don't think there is any hope the ARCSS can be revitalised as it is structurally inadequate to address the current drivers of conflict.\"\n\nSouth Sudan is an unfinished state that needs both reconciliation and true nation-building.\n\nThere are no stable institutions. Basic social services are provided by foreign aid workers, and since independence in 2011, the security sector has never been professionalised, nor properly integrated.\n\n\"The country went from a factionalised group of independent militaries fighting a common enemy [the north] to a 'unified' government built on a patronage system supported by a policy of kleptocracy,\" said Brand.\n\nResearcher Alan Boswell agreed. \"South Sudan is broken at its most fundamental level: What is South Sudan? Who is entitled to rule it? These are questions that South Sudanese have never sat down and negotiated or decided.\"\n\nThe last peace deal \"pushed for power-sharing and competitive politics simultaneously among armed parties,\" he told IRIN. \"It was destined to explode, and it did. The peace deal is obsolete and was mad to begin with.\"\n\nRachel Jacob at Max Security Solutions, a geopolitical risk consulting firm, said any future peace deal \"must be more inclusive. [But] this effort is not being made.\"\n\nThere is instead a pervasive culture of impunity, which fuels recurring cycles of violence and mass atrocities.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned the government and opposition for failing to stop civilian killings, rape, and forced displacement.\n\nIn its latest report, it says nine men - including Kiir, Machar, former army chief of staff Paul Malong, and six other commanders - should be investigated and, if culpable, prosecuted for the grave rights violations.\n\n\"Fighting has spread to all regions of South Sudan and shows no signs of abating, nor is that likely so as long as the incentives to pursue military solutions remain unchanged, particularly for the government,\" said Kate Almquist Knopf, director of the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at National Defense University, Washington.\n\nThe war is not only generating a refugee crisis felt by neighbouring countries, but it has also displaced internally close to two million people, and left 5.8 million in need of aid - aid that is increasingly being used to perpetuate the fighting.\n\n\"The time has come for the international community to hold perpetrators accountable for the misery they have inflicted upon their country and the deadly conflict they continue to wage without justification or remorse,\" said Juliette Paauwe at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect.\n\nThe sad fact, noted Brand, is that the international community is \"flat out of new ideas to bring peace to South Sudan.\" But the bottom line is that neither Kiir nor Machar \"can lead South Sudan to peace\".\n\nSouth Sudan is falling apart. \"All sides keep getting weaker and the pieces become more and more difficult to put back together,\" said Boswell.\n\n\"The previous peace deal expanded the war nationally and further fragmented the country. Building on top of its rubble is a terrible, dangerous idea,\" he added. \"The whole process needs to start over. The whole approach must change.\"\n\nThe way forward is a new peace plan that does not solely focus on a bilateral agreement between Kiir and Machar, argued Jacob at Max Security Solutions.\n\n\"It must recognise that there are many more important political and military actors who must participate in order for any peace process to succeed,\" she added.\n\nPhil Clark, a Great Lakes expert at SOAS, University of London, made a similar case.\n\n\"A major issue neglected by the ARCSS was community level reconciliation. A new process needs to address long-standing grievances at the local level,\" he told IRIN.\n\n\"Much of the violence is being committed by militias and community perpetrators - in addition to the national army - and any comprehensive response must address conflicts between different local groups.\"\n\nKnopf offered a more radical solution.

As many as 85 percent of those reaching Uganda recount horrific tales of seeing armed groups burning villagers alive in their houses, shooting people in front of their families, raping women and girls, and seizing boys to serve as conscripts, the United Nations reported.\n\nThe villagers often travel for days through the bush to avoid indiscriminate killings by the marauding armed groups, which have set up checkpoints on the roads.\n\nHundreds have escaped to South Sudan's other neighbors -- notably Sudan and Ethiopia -- where, the refugee agency said, an additional 1 million have sought shelter. Two million more have been driven from their homes for other reasons, the agency said.\n\nSouth Sudan became the world's newest nation in 2011, when it declared its independence after five decades of guerrilla warfare and the loss of 2 million lives.

The bloodshed has escalated and intensified in the last year, with a sharp rise in ethnically targeted killings and sexual violence.\n\nThe United Nations started deploying 4,000 troops to South Sudan this month to bolster a peacekeeping force of 13,000, but as violence has spread to new provinces, the agency has not been able to do much to protect civilians outside its bases or to prevent attacks on relief agency staff members trying to deliver humanitarian aid.", "id": "9779466", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "More than 1 million South Sudanese flee from violence to Uganda", "image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/64/55/21/13816898/3/rawImage.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "93926", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}, "id": "305665", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rape"}, "id": "305935", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"}, {"label": {"eng": "War"}, "id": "309009", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Salva Kiir Mayardit"}, "id": "312042", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir_Mayardit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}, "id": "312043", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Riek Machar"}, "id": "312046", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riek_Machar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peacekeeping"}, "id": "314011", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aid"}, "id": "318692", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}, "id": "319038", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "21:23:00"}

Designated in 2008, the day rallies us to advocate for the safety and security of humanitarian workers, and for the dignified survival and well-being of people affected by crises.\n\nThis year, we focus on civilians caught up in conflict. With the theme 'civilians are not a target,' it calls for leaders everywhere to do everything in their power to protect civilians caught in armed conflict.\n\nWith its open-door policy in welcoming fleeing refugees, Uganda continues to lead Africa and has set a global best practice for the international community, including Uganda's neighbours, to heed.\n\nDescribed by the secretary-general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, as a symbol of integrity in refugee protection, Uganda's progressive policy sees refugees settled in communities, amongst Ugandans, as opposed to camps.\n\nThis dignified approach where refugees are provided a small piece of land for shelter and cultivation sets an example based on humanity. In addition, refugees enjoy freedom of movement and can seek employment, go to school or start a business in the areas they are settled.\n\nThe generosity and investments of the Ugandan government and people in maintaining an open-door, transformative policy, is unique, particularly at a time when the asylum space is shrinking across the world.\n\nA recent UNDP study found that the government and local communities spent over $323 million in 2016/17 on the protection and management of refugees and the provision of essential services, which is equivalent to 46 per cent of the education budget or 62 per cent of the health budget.\n\nThe government of Uganda and the United Nations system are committed to delivering as one.\n\nAt the heart of this commitment is the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, which is fully aligned to the government's second National Development Plan, and includes how the rights and needs of displaced persons must be understood not only as \"humanitarian\" in nature, but equally as development challenges to be addressed in concert with the needs of host communities and local institutions.\n\nSince 2015, the United Nations and World Bank in Uganda have supported the government's Settlement Transformative Agenda through the Refugee and Host Population Empowerment Strategy (ReHoPE). This strategy supports Uganda in building resilience and self-reliance of refugees as well as their host communities.\n\nUganda's refugee-hosting model is an inspiration regionally and globally. Uganda has invested significantly in making this possible. However, for the model to be sustained, it needs our support.\n\nIn June this year, the world came to Uganda to celebrate this model as well as commit to supporting it during the Uganda Solidarity Summit for Refugees.\n\nFunds totalling over $350 million were pledged by various countries, development agencies and private sector entities to support efforts towards supporting over 1.3 million refugees and some 502,000 people in host communities in 12 districts in Uganda.\n\nThis support will go a long way in providing some of the most vulnerable people in society with healthcare, education, water and sanitation, and improved livelihoods.\n\nApart from supporting refugees, Uganda also deserves tremendous praise for the hundreds of humanitarian workers she sends into conflict zones across the world, to provide services to those affected by crises.\n\nUgandan doctors and health workers were amongst some of the first deployed to support the World Health Organisation (WHO) to fight the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia in 2014.\n\nUgandans are also present as aid workers in South Sudan, Somalia and various other parts of the globe supporting those caught up in crisis. Several Ugandans have lost their lives in these processes.\n\nThese examples clearly demonstrate the dedication of Uganda's people and government to serving humanity.\n\nI invite each one of us to applaud the government and people of Uganda for their dedication to humanitarian affairs and the values associated with providing dignified assistance. I invite Ugandans to share this knowledge with future generations to help nurture this national commitment to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nAs we commemorate World Humanitarian day, let us remember those who have lost their lives in the service of humanity, and let us re-commit to ensuring those that serve at the frontlines of conflict are provided the safety, dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nThe author is the UN resident coordinator/UNDP resident representative.", "id": "9811419", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": " Let's continue providing a home for those fleeing conflict", "image": "http://www.observer.ug/images/Rosa-Mlango-OP.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 530, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 539}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "131", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "207", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}, "id": "304530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}, "id": "307374", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Bank"}, "id": "312164", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}, "id": "325758", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}, "id": "340998", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics of Uganda"}, "id": "496271", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Uganda"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "02:42:00"}

The arrival of South Sudanese refugees is driven by very high levels of food insecurity in South Sudan and continued violence. As of end of December 2016, more than 300,000 South Sudanese individuals have arrived in Sudan, seeking refuge, mostly in White Nile State, South Kordofan,\n\nWest Kordofan, East Darfur, South Darfur, and Khartoum. The majority of South Sudanese refugees has settled in refugee camps in White Nile .\n\nMany of the new arrivals in White Nile reached the border to Sudan exhausted, nutritionally weak and in poor health, with many of them having travelled under difficult conditions to escape violence and deprivation. Most have come without significant belongings, money, livestock or other assets. In the camps, most refugees face insufficient access to basic services, including food, shelter, water, sanitation, health and education. In addition, the basic services in host communities are not capable of accommodating the large influx of new arrivals.\n\nThe 2016 Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) is the first such exercise for the South Sudanese refugees in White Nile state and was initiated jointly by UNHCR, WFP and COR to 1) establish a comprehensive understanding of the needs, risks, capacities, and vulnerabilities of refugees with regard to food security and nutrition; 2) examine the ongoing humanitarian response; and 3) make recommendations to improve the provision of assistance. The findings and recommendations of the 2016 JAM will form the basis of the Joint Plan of Action, designed to improve assistance to refugees for the coming two years.\n\nThe JAM was conducted by UNHCR, WFP, COR and cooperating partners from 26 November to 1 December 2016 and included an extensive literature review and secondary data analysis; and primary data collection from six refugee camps in White Nile state. Primary data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household interviews and general observations. Important secondary data sources included recently completed assessments and surveys in the areas of nutrition, food security, livelihood, logistics and markets.\n\nThe findings of the food security assessment conducted by WFP in November 2016 revealed that 53 percent of South Sudanese refugees in White Nile is not categorized as food secure. The demographical composition of the refugees has contributed to their vulnerability as the majority concern women-headed households with an above-average number of children and a belowaverage number of working-age men. Many women-headed households experience the doubleburden of caring for their family members while also having to generate income. Low-income work and unemployment, combined with high food prices resulted in very limited economic access to food: seventy-eight percent of refugees were unable to afford the price of the local food basket. Food consumption among children aged 6-23 months - a critical age for development - was poor: only 4 percent of children were found to have minimum acceptable diets in WFP food security assessment for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in White Nile, April 2016.\n\nResults were also weak for infant and young child feeding indicators (including timely initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for infants 0-5 months, and the introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft food for children 6-8 months).\n\nThe JAM found that the coverage of food assistance programs was acceptable, but highlighted the heavy reliance on unconditional activities, especially General Food Distribution provided by WFP.\n\nOpportunities should be explored to conduct household-level targeting to identify refugees that could benefit from conditional food assistance, aimed at enhancing self-reliance through the development of assets, capacities and skills at the individual, household- or community level.\n\nThe current dependency on humanitarian assistance is not sustainable and may eventually be difficult to roll back if appropriate measures are not implemented to promote the livelihoods and self-reliance of the refugees and the host communities. Whilst it is important for relief agencies to continue supporting the poor and vulnerable, efforts should also be directed towards enhancing the livelihoods of the refugee population. To support the push for livelihood interventions, this assessment recommends that a joint refugee profiling exercise be explored by main providers of assistance. A common understanding of households-level vulnerabilities would facilitate a coordinated inter-sectorial response to humanitarian and early recovery needs.\n\nDespite efforts to provide all range of primary healthcare services in the camps, the temporary structure is, in general, sub-standard with insufficient space and light. Even, essential facilities such as hand washing are lacking. The capacity of the infrastructure to provide privacy of patients is minimal. In all locations, the inpatient medical ward is not segregated by gender and age.\n\nStandardised Expanded Nutrition Surveys (SENS) South Sudanese refugee camps in White Nile, in October 2016, indicated that the overall nutrition situation is critical with high Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates that are above the 15 percent emergency threshold that the WHO has set. Likewise, the Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence also ranges from 2.6 percent to 5 percent (any SAM rates above 2 percent are seen as critical as per WHO classification). The prevalence of anaemia among children aged 6-59 months was above the 40 percent public health significance as per WFP classification (ranging between 46.6 percent - 69.4 percent). The prevalence of stunting among children aged 6-59 months in all camps was found to be within the acceptable standard <20 percent. The mission recommended to strengthen community outreach through providing training to local nutrition and health staff and by increasing field monitoring and on the job training.\n\nThe quality and quantity of water are reportedly acceptable, but hygiene promotion varies across the camps; all locations have family shared latrines close to their shelters. However, the presence of open defecations in the surroundings of the camps is an indication that the number of latrines constructed might not be adequate to meet the needs. The mission recommends to carry out a Knowledge, Attitude and Practices Survey in all camps in 2017 and to share the outcomes and recommendations of this survey with the concerned agencies so that follow-up can take place accordingly.\n\nIn this report, the JAM team has consolidated all findings gathered from consulted secondary sources and primary data collected from the field in order to presented the key findings for key institutions and authorities, including UNHCR and WFP, Commission for Refugees (COR), cooperating partners, and representatives from donors including the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), UK Department for International Development (DFID), and the US embassy in Sudan and United State Agency for International Development (USAID).", "id": "9864813", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) White Nile - Sudan 26th November - 1 St December 2016, Final Report", "image":

There is 23-year-old Gloria Keoji, the only adult, and six children. The oldest is 17, the youngest three months. There are five girls and a boy. The ties that bind them are made more of blood spilt than blood shared but, they insist, they are a family nonetheless.\n\nAll have their tales of violence, told fast and quietly while looking at the red soil between naked and calloused feet, or staring into the vast blue sky above the bush. These memories are too fresh to confront face on.\n\nFighting between militia factions and government forces in South Sudan, the world's youngest state, over the past year has created the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world.\n\nOn Thursday, the number of people fleeing across the border to Uganda passed a million, the UN's refugee agency said. Another million have fled into Ethiopia, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most were women and children escaping \"barbaric violence\", UNHCR said.\n\nOver the past year, an average of 1,800 South Sudanese have arrived in Uganda every day. Some crossed the border with the rest of their family, but not many.\n\nZubeida Flores describes how she hid under a bed as her father was shot dead by government troops outside her home during a night raid on her village in Equatoria province in February. The 14-year-old fled into the bush and eventually reached safety in the camps in Uganda that, for a year, have welcomed refugees as they limp across the border. Here, in Imvepi camp, she met Gloria.\n\nHer new sisters are Margaret and Betty Tomalu, aged 16 and 17. Their parents, farmers with no interest in war or politics, disappeared in a rebel night raid on their village in March. The girls hid, then retrieved a few possessions and began walking.\n\nAs the teenagers talk, Sharon, aged three, falls quiet. Keoji saw the child standing alone among the burning homes of her village in Yei River state during the raid in which soldiers took her own husband. Sharon's parents had also been rounded up on to army trucks, and the troops were returning.\n\nWithout thinking, Keoji seized her as she fled with her own children, aged two and three months. They walked for 60 miles (100km) and crossed into Uganda. Now Sharon clings to her as the group sits and talks outside the small shelter they have built as a home with tarpaulins and wood provided by NGOs.\n\n\"We are one family now. Yes, we argue, and there are many difficulties. But Gloria is in charge. I have lost so very much. I will not lose what God has given me here,\" Zubeida said.\n\nAt the reception centre in Imvepi, 30 miles from the border, officials have logged 1,400 children who have arrived unaccompanied, and 5,400 separated from their families. They include a 14-year-old who had led five younger childrenacross war-torn forest and fields for weeks, a seven-year-old who made it entirely alone, and an abandoned three-year-old who has yet to be identified because he cannot describe his family.\n\nFew among the refugees have mobile phones, and given that South Sudan has almost no roads - let alone internet, mobile network or even a postal service - separation can last a lifetime, whether premeditated or simply a consequence of an instant decision taken in a moment of confusion and fear.\n\nIn the camps, new families form to replace those destroyed by flight and war. Some form as children seek protection and care, often offered by adults who have themselves lost sons or daughters.\n\nOthers are brought together by World Vision, an NGO which works in Uganda to place unaccompanied children in new families under the responsibility of \"foster parents\" among the refugees, and then monitors their welfare.\n\n\"Most people who come here have so much hate and so much hurt. We try and put the communities back together,\" said Evelyn Atim, World Vision's child protection coordinator.\n\nSome such new families are very large, in part because of the necessity of putting children with others from similar ethnic and linguistic groups.\n\nBesta Awadiya, who was separated from her husband as she fled fighting in her village in Yei River state with her six children, now has a total of 24, aged from three to 17. Nine are the children of a brother whose whereabouts are unknown. Four more are brothers brought out of South Sudan by the oldest, a truculent 16-year-old. The remaining five were led to Imvepi by Nuela Etaku, 17.\n\n\"I take all the children as my own,\" said Awadiya, 34.\n\nEtaku returned from school with her best friend in March to find their village devastated by an unidentified armed group. Corpses littered the ground, and there was no sign of their parents. She gathered three younger siblings who had fled terrified into the bush, and followed neighbours. A month later, they reached the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Etaku decided she and her charges would be better off in Uganda and brought them, after more long days walking, to Imvepi.\n\n\"It is hard to be in charge, because I am young. But I try to do my best for the others,\" Etaku said.\n\nUganda has a generous policy toward refugees, allowing them to work and travel. Families get a 50 by 50-metre plot of land to farm and build a home.\n\nThey are unable to return home, however, until the government decides conditions are right for repatriation en masse. This is partly to stop factions in South Sudan, particularly opposition forces, recruiting among the vast numbers of idle and angry young men in the Ugandan camps.\n\nThis would not be hard. There are problems with gangs and alcohol. Some men had already fought before fleeing to Uganda.\n\nAuthorities keep a watchful eye for radicalisation and \"political activities\".\n\n\"We have our own network in the camps and we are very well informed,\" said Dennis Imbaguta, the Ugandan official who runs the Imvepi camp, now home of 135,000 refugees.\n\nFew anticipate, or desire, an early return to South Sudan. The children go to schools which though rudimentary and overcrowded are still better than anything in their homeland, even in times of peace.\n\nNor do many expect much from the future. The boys talk vaguely of learning skills, and Ekatu wants to be a nurse or a teacher. But the psychological wounds are deep and World Vision and other NGOs can only provide limited support.\n\n\"Sometimes she cries and cries. If I can find a little money I buy her sweets. Other days she just sits silently by herself from dawn until sunset,\" said Keoji, of her adopted three-year-old daughter Sharon.\n\nFor many, a reliable supply of enough food to survive and a degree of security is enough for the moment. Life follows a slow rhythm: school, church, football games on a dirt road, a ragged crowd watching a makeshift kite swoop against the sunset.\n\n\"If the war ends I will go and look for my parents. If not, I will stay here.

flooding and landslides which have killed several hundred people, including at least 109 children.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise, with more than 600 people, many of them children, still unaccounted for, the agency said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe disaster struck on Monday and UNICEF has been providing safe drinking water and sanitation in addition to delivering medicines,

water sources have been contaminated, while water supply networks have been damaged.\n\nUN refugee chief appeals for more support for Sudan\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees is calling for more support for Sudan, which has had a long tradition of hosting people fleeing conflict.\n\nFilippo Grandi made the appeal during his first official visit to the country, which concluded on Thursday.\n\nSudan has taken in scores of refugees fleeing fighting in South Sudan.\n\nThe UN refugee chief said the refugees are allowed to work and to move around, in addition to receiving what he described as \"generous support\" from host communities.\n\nDuring a visit to a camp in East Darfur that is home to more than 5,000 South Sudanese refugees, he praised the solidarity of the local people hosting them.\n\nMr Grandi said this \"exceptional generosity needed to be acknowledged and supported.\"\n\nHe also urged the international community to do more to end the conflict in South Sudan which has created what he said is \"the world's fastest-growing forced displacement tragedy.\"\n\nFortified rice reduces anaemia among poor women in Bangladesh: WFP\n\nConsuming fortified rice can significantly reduce anaemia and zinc deficiencies among the poorest women in Bangladesh, according to a new UN-backed study.\n\nAnaemia is a health condition resulting from a lack of red blood cells, thus causing fatigue, dizziness and other symptoms.\n\nThe study found that the prevalence of anaemia dropped by nearly five percent among participants who ate the fortified rice, which contains six essential vitamins and minerals, including iron.\n\nMeanwhile, zinc deficiency was reduced by six per cent.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that providing fortified rice alongside training programmes and cash investments can contribute to women's empowerment.\n\nThe study was conducted on behalf of the UN World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThe women in the study are participants in the government's Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme, which reaches more than one million poor women and their families.\n\nWFP Representative in Bangladesh Christa R\u00e4der described the findings as \"very promising.\"", "id": "9706997", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "News in Brief 17 August 2017 (AM)", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17",

More than 85 per cent are women and children. This represents an average of 1,800 people crossing into Uganda every day for the last 12 months. In addition to the million there, almost a million South Sudanese are being hosted by Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic. Partners in Central Equatoria's Yei County estimate that more than 25,000 people crossed to Uganda in the second week of August following an increase in road ambushes by opposition forces along Kaya-Yei road. The heightened insecurity in the border villages of Yei County, forced the people to ee in fear of retaliatory attacks. For months, humanitarian actors have experienced access denials by both government and non-state armed actors.

Displacement, lack of access to education, sexual gender-based violence, inflation -- the list goes on. On top of that, in February 2017, the United Nations announced a famine in South Sudan. One affecting upwards of 50% of the population, including a million children.\n\nThis isn't your 'average' famine. Normally, a famine would be the result of nature -- a destructive hurricane, floods, drought, wildfires...but not this time. This time, we're talking about a famine caused by war. This time, it was a 'manmade' famine. And in many ways, that's so much worse. Because this time, it was avoidable.\n\nThe famine in South Sudan is a perfect example of one of the side effects of conflict. Militant groups have been terrorizing South Sudanese people since its independence in 2013. All South Sudanese civilians have been doing is fleeing violence. And when you're literally running for your life, who can plant crops on time and keep track of livestock?\n\nThankfully, when we asked for your help, you listened. You cared. You acted. Thanks to the generous response of our supporters earlier this year, we were able to help local communities in South Sudan tackle this latest challenge of food insecurity.\n\nWe put your donations to work right away by distributing seeds and farming tools to hundreds of women and men in need. Farmers were (finally!) able to plant high quality crops on time. With your help, we provided communities with the tools they need to plant, cultivate, and harvest the right crops, helping them to avert famine.\n\nThe support we received from our donors does so much more than feed people. It gives women and men in South Sudan the opportunity to be in control of their own futures. It ensures families have enough food to feed their children -- which means more kids stay in school and out of the workforce. And thanks to you, hundreds of people in South Sudan will start to harvest crops in a few short weeks. These crops will feed thousands of people.\n\nEven though the famine has been 'downgraded', we're a long way from the goal-post when it comes to reversing the effects of this year's famine. War Child will stay on the ground in South Sudan and continue to work with the most vulnerable communities. We want to bridge the short-term solutions with longer-term ones.\n\nIf you want to be a peacemaker and like us, you're in it for the long haul, consider making a donation to War Child to help us bring justice, education and opportunity to countries like South Sudan.\n\nVery soon, South Sudanese farmers will know the fruits of their labour.

Panellists included: Mohamed Ousman Elrekabi, Sudan's Minister of Finance; Mohamed Ahmed Bushra Badawi, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan; Ahmed Dirdeiry, Managing Partner of Dirdeiry & Associates; and George Elombi, an Executive Vice President at Afreximbank.\n\nThose travelling to Sudan need to ensure they've downloaded all the apps they'll require during their visit before leaving, as some popular apps are inaccessible in the northeastern African country.\n\nSo said Ahmed Dirdeiry, Managing Partner of Sudanese law firm Dirdeiry & Associates, during a panel discussion at the recent Afreximbank annual general meeting in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nLikewise, it is not possible to buy a book via Amazon, pay a hotel bill using a credit card, or send and receive cash transfers while in Sudan.\n\nThis situation is due to sanctions barring US companies from doing business with Sudan, introduced in November 1997 by then president, Bill Clinton. The sanctions prohibited the trade in most goods and services between the US and Sudan, and blocked Sudanese government property in the US.\n\nClinton's executive order gave three reasons for the sanctions: 1) Sudan's continued support for international terrorism; 2) ongoing efforts to destabilise neighbouring governments; and 3) the prevalence of human rights violations, including slavery and the denial of religious freedom. These, according to the president, constituted an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security and foreign policy of the US.\n\nHowever, there has recently been optimism that the sanctions will be permanently lifted. In January this year, in one of his last acts as US president, Barack Obama issued an executive order that revoked certain Sudan-related sanctions, and called for their re-evaluation by 12 July 2017.\n\nObama highlighted Sudan's positive actions over the preceding six months as the reason for temporarily revoking some of the sanctions, citing \"a marked reduction in offensive military activity, culminating in a pledge to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan, and steps toward the improvement of humanitarian access throughout Sudan, as well as cooperation with the United States on addressing regional conflicts and the threat of terrorism\".\n\nAccording to Dirdeiry, Obama's directive \"became the reason of great hope in Sudan... and became a reason that people started to dream about... the entire removal of the sanctions from Sudan\".\n\nHowever, Sudan will have to wait a bit longer to know its fate. On 11 July, the Trump administration announced the extension of the review period by a further three months, due to the fact that it is a new government that hasn't had adequate time to review the sanctions. \"There was a feeling that the additional time was needed to ensure that, given the scope and gravity of this decision, we reached the proper outcome,\" commented a senior administration official.\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF THE SANCTIONS\n\nTechnically, the sanctions only implicated US firms, and there were no legal restrictions preventing companies from other countries from transacting with Sudan. Mohamed Ahmed Bushra Badawi, an Assistant Governor at the Central Bank of Sudan, said that even though being sanctioned by the world's biggest economy did have an impact, for many years Sudan continued to receive significant foreign investment from other countries.\n\nHowever, the situation took on a new dimension in the first half of this decade, when the US started charging European banks for violating American sanctions by processing US-dollar transactions related to countries such as Sudan, Cuba and Iran. In 2014, French lender BNP Paribas admitted to criminal charges for processing payments for countries subject to US sanctions, and paid a record $8.9 billion settlement, while its rival Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Germany's Commerzbank paid penalties of $787 million and $1.45 billion, respectively, for similar accusations.\n\nAs a result, banks from across the world stopped transacting with Sudan for fear of American penalties - the \"globalisation of the entire sanctions regime\", as Dirdeiry describes it. \"It has become a situation of not only the US imposing sanctions on Sudan, but the entire world imposing sanctions on Sudan because they fear that they will be penalised by the US.\"\n\n\"This made all banks to be risk averse - i.e. to avoid doing business with Sudanese parties,\" added Badawi.\n\nFor instance, if an Indian food manufacturer wanted to open a factory in Sudan, there is nothing in Indian law preventing it from doing so. However, according to Dirdeiry, this company would find it next to impossible to transfer capital to and from Sudan, because no bank would be willing to do so.\n\nAnother challenge highlighted during the panel discussion is that companies have become \"over compliant\" so as to avoid the ire of the US. For instance, it was mentioned that even though trade in certain agriculture-related products is allowed, relatively few entities have taken advantage of these opportunities.\n\nSimilarly, Obama's relaxing of sanctions on 13 January didn't lead to the expected increase in business activity with Sudan. According to Badawi, this is because Sudan remains on a US State Department list of countries sponsoring terrorism, together with the fact that a number of Sudanese individuals and companies are still on the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions lists.\n\nHe said that following Obama's decision, Sudan did launch an information campaign to inform banks that US entities are now allowed to legally transact with Sudan. However, the reaction from the lenders were \"generally very cautious and diplomatic; they didn't say 'yes' and they didn't say 'no', which means they are waiting for 12 July.\"\n\nBadawi added that, \"Some American banks, in their communication with other correspondent [banks], still ask the question, 'Do you have any business with Sudan? So other banks play it safe, and they say 'no'.\"\n\nBUSINESS AND INVESTMENT POTENTIAL\n\nThe permanent lifting of sanctions could start a new economic era for Sudan. With over 40 million people and an abundance of natural resources, the country presents numerous investment opportunities. It is rumoured that a delegation from a prominent US automobile manufacturer recently visited the capital, Khartoum, to scout for opportunities.\n\nBy the end of 2016, Sudan was Africa's seventh-largest economy, with gross domestic product (GDP) advancing by 4.9% and 3.1% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The African Economic Outlook report states growth will be driven by the continued expansion of agriculture, gold production, and services. The settlement of the internal conflicts, including that in South Sudan (which seceded in 2011), and greater macroeconomic stability could also boost the economy.\n\nTo stimulate the manufacturing sector, the government is promoting investment in the two free trade zones (there are plans to increase the number of free zones to six), which can be used as a base to cater not only for the Sudanese market, but also neighbouring landlocked countries such as Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The majority of Sudan's exports (55%) currently go to the Gulf region, while the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) accounts for about 18%.\n\nBut despite its opportunities, Sudan remains a tough place to do business. Ranking 168th (out of 190 economies) in the World Bank's ease of doing business index, Sudan has its work cut out in areas such as access to credit, protecting minority investors, and trading across borders. Business people would furthermore have to contend with underdeveloped infrastructure and a shortage of highly-skilled professionals due to emigration to Gulf countries where salaries are significantly higher.\n\nAccording to the African Economic Outlook report, \"risks include low global commodity export prices, the absence of policy cushions, a weak business environment together with the ongoing civil wars in some parts of the country, which could further worsen the fiscal and external financing gaps, leading to lower real growth. Nevertheless, the formation of a government of national reconciliation in the context of the national dialogue bodes well for broad-based growth.\"\n\nOPPORTUNITIES IN KEY SECTORS\n\nSudan offers investment and business opportunities in a variety of areas, with the government specifically encouraging increasing exports and import substitution.\n\nExtractive industries\n\nSudan's Ministry of Investment is seeking investors to exploit the country's large deposits of gold, silver, chrome, iron, zinc and tin, in addition to its oil and gas reserves. \"Sudan has a very vast base of natural resources,\" commented a Sudanese diplomat who attended the panel discussion. \"Many people are asking how can a country like Sudan sustain these sanctions for two decades? We can do it because we have very vast natural resources... Sudan is number four in the world in terms of natural resources.\"\n\nGold mining is anticipated to continue playing an important economic role in the years to come. In January, the Central Bank loosened its monopoly on gold exports by allowing companies to export 70% of production, and sell the rest through the Bank. It is expected that small- and medium-sized gold prospecting firms will benefit from this measure.\n\nBut Sudan's oil industry is struggling due to lower prices and ageing fields. It lost about 75% of its oil revenue following the secession of South Sudan, where most of its oil fields were located. However, landlocked South Sudan continues to export its oil through a 1,610\u2011km pipeline that runs across Sudan to the Red Sea.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture is the biggest sector in Sudan, contributing just over 30% to GDP. The climate ranges from desert in the far north, to tropical in the south, and the country is endowed with about 26 million hectares of fertile land. Major agricultural exports are gum arabic (used as a stabiliser in the food industry), sorghum, oil seeds, cotton and sugar. Sudan also has significant animal resources - including camels, cattle, goats and sheep - which are used for meat and leather exports.\n\nThe government is placing a strong emphasis on agri-processing activities. For instance, Mohamed Ousman Elrekabi, Minister of Finance, conceded that despite being the world's largest producer of gum arabic, Sudan is not sufficiently adding value to this crop. Other agriculture-related business opportunities highlighted by the Ministry of Investment include: horticultural irrigation schemes; irrigation products and services, such as water pipes and the drilling of ground wells; and improved seeds and fertilisers.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInvestors are being sought for primary infrastructure projects that will serve as a foundation for future development. One of the opportunities that have been highlighted is electricity production and distribution. Although Sudan has to date focused on hydropower and thermal power plants, there is now a strong emphasis on renewable energy. Other focus areas include the construction of roads and bridges, the provision of rural and urban drinking water, and the development of housing and commercial real estate.\n\nTourism\n\nSudan has a handful of tourist sites which investors in this sector can leverage for new tourism ventures. These include locations along the Red Sea coast and the bank of the Nile River, the Dinder National Park, and a number of archaeological sites related to ancient civilisations. According to the Ministry of Investment, there is potential to establish hotels, provide transport services for tourists, supply yachts, boats and diving kits, and develop and rehabilitate archaeological sites.\n\nGREAT EXPECTATIONS\n\nAlthough there remain many uncertainties about the permanent lifting of sanctions, the panel participants generally regarded it as a question of \"when\", not \"if\". And despite the fact that it has extended the review period by three months, the Trump administration's recognition that \"Sudan has made significant process\", gives reason for hope.\n\n\"The improvements in Sudan mean that we have to begin to open our minds to the vast opportunities there,\" commented George Elombi, an Executive Vice President at Afreximbank.\n\nAccording to Dirdeiry, the factors for the original implementation of the trade embargo have been addressed, and he is confident the sanctions will be revoked. He added it is unlikely that the momentum already created around the lifting of the sanctions, will just \"die away with no real action\".\n\nSource: https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/post-sanctions-sudan-unique-opportunity-frontier-market-investors/59475/", "id": "9600629", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Post-sanctions Sudan: A unique opportunity for frontier-market investors? - The Sudanese Media Center", "image": "http://smc.sd/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/khartoum-600-300x189@2x-1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 212, "date": "2017-06-28", "amb": false, "dateEnd": "2017-07-01", "textEnd": 234}, {"textStart": 2030, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-07-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2042}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 2775, "date": "2017-07-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2782}, {"textStart": 5334, "date": "-01-13", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5344}, {"textStart": 1139, "date": "1997-11-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1152}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "68", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "366509", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}, "type": "loc"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "02:51:00"}

The demands include cooperation on counterterrorism as well as sincere Sudanese efforts to end internal conflicts.\n\n\"Times have changed in the Sudan, it's a different country than it was in the early 1990s when it was a known sponsor of terror and the removal of sanctions is a logical consequence of improvements from Sudan,\" said former US Senator Robert Torricelli (D-New Jersey) who in the early 1990s as a US congressman worked on legislation tied to Sudan.\n\nSudan has focused significant diplomatic resources on persuading Washington in recent months.\n\nSudan's officials and diplomats have been frequent visitors to Washington. They have been consistently making the case to the new administration that Sudan is a strong partner in the war on terror and regional security concerns.\n\nIn June, the government hired the public relations firm Squire Patton Boggs to lobby on behalf of Khartoum.\n\nSudan's Finance Minister and Speaker of the Parliament and a host of other officials have visited Washington in recent months to make their case.\n\nSome remain unconvinced\n\nThose supporting continued sanctions include an unlikely alliance of lobbyists, evangelical Christian groups, and Hollywood stars like George Clooney and others who remain unconvinced with Sudan's shift in policies is enough to warrant the end of sanctions.\n\nThe United States isn't the only country which is experiencing a new political leadership.\n\nSudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has announced plans to step down from office in 2020 as part of a slow shuffle towards a more inclusive and multi-party political system.\n\nThis year Sudan named Hassan Saleh its first Prime Minister in 28 years, and a cabinet reshuffle brought new faces to his cabinet.\n\nThe reforms are part of a National Dialogue and peace process which began in 2014 and have mostly ended the conflict in Darfur. But in the Nuba mountains, despite peace efforts, conflict still simmers.\n\nAs a result of these reforms, Ibrahim Ahmed Omer who served as Sudan's speaker of parliament for over a decade was made to retire by the ruling National Congress Party. In a swan-song appearance at the National Press Club in Washington D.C., Omer pointed out that sanctions mean the United States is missing out on economic opportunities in Sudan.\n\n\"Capitalism, as they say, is a court investor and won't come unless money is safe and the experience of these other countries show that the money is safe,\" he said. \"...the West should lift all sanctions on the Sudanese people in order to end poverty and improve the economic situation it is losing,\" he said.\n\nOmer noted that despite sanctions, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia and Arab countries have been investing in Sudanese the gold, precious minerals, and oil sectors for years.\n\nSudanese officials have grown tired of working closely with Chinese officials. According to one source, Chinese officials have vastly under-reported gold excavations in Sudan to avoid paying certain taxes.\n\nThe decision to continue the review period for a further three months is frustrating for Sudan.\n\nAs made clear, the country has worked hard to fulfil the American demands and believes it is in full compliance with the demands to lift sanctions.\n\nSource: http://lawrencefreemanafricaandtheworld.com/2017/08/12/trump-official-visits-khartoum-as-us-seems-poised-to-end-sudan-sanctions/", "id": "9625802", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Opinion: US Seems Poised to end Sudan Sanctions - The Sudanese Media Center", "image": "http://smc.sd/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/Khartoum-Sudan-1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 345, "date": "2017-09-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 357}, {"textStart": 4415, "date": "2017-08-12", "amb": true, "textEnd": 4425}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "100", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "158", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "196", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Khartoum"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "10957", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum", "label": {"eng": "Khartoum"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "180884", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arab people"}, "id": "309890", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}, "id": "310769", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}, "id": "342539", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Omar al-Bashir"}, "id": "355762", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir"}, {"label": {"eng": "War in Darfur"}, "id": "356716", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oxfam"}, "id": "371348", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuba Mountains"}, "id": "574631", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuba_Mountains"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "06:40:00"}

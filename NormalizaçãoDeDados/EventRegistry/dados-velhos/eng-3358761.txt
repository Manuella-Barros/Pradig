according to several media reports.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested Saturday, the Associated Press reported. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in the crash and several others were injured. The car attack on the counter-protesters occurred during a white nationalist rally.\n\nFields, of Ohio, grew up in Florence, in northern Kentucky, according to his mother, Samantha Bloom, the Associated Press reported. Bloom told the AP she received a text from Fields last week that said he had gotten some time off from work and was going to a rally. Bloom said Fields had not given any details about the rally, but told him to be careful and peaceful.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally, the AP reported.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.\n\nFields was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit-and-run attended failure to stop with injury, police told the AP.\n\nFields' father was killed by a drunk driver before Fields was born, an uncle of Fields told the Washington Post. Fields' father left him money that the uncle kept in a trust until Fields became an adult, the uncle told the Post.\n\n\"When he turned 18, he demanded his money, and that was the last I had any contact with him,\" the uncle said.\n\nFields' ex-high school teacher, Derek Weimer, told WCPO-TV in Cincinnati that Fields was a quiet student who had some \"radical ideas on race.\" Weimer told the station that he taught history to Fields at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Ky.\n\n\"He was very infatuated with the Nazis, with Adolf Hitler. He also had a huge military history, especially with German military history and World War II. But, he was pretty infatuated with that stuff,\" Weimer told WCPO-TV.\n\nThe teacher also told WCPO that Fields had wanted to join the Army, but couldn't because of his mental health history.\n\nA Carfax report shows the vehicle used in the attack was purchased in June 2015 from Kelly Toyota in Florence, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The title for the vehicle was updated the next month in Maumee, Ohio.\n\nOnline records do not show any previous criminal history for Fields, the Enquirer reported.", "time": "15:25:00"}

white nationalist rally was \"very infatuated with the Nazis,\" according to one of his high school teachers.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, is charged with second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death. Federal officials also have opened a civil rights investigation.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were wounded when the car plowed into the counter-protesters Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nField's mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\nShe said she'd told her son \"to be careful\" and to peaceful.\n\nUPDATE: Arrest made in Saturday fatality at 4th and Water streets. #cvilleaug12 pic.twitter.com/SKLHnfNGvg -- Charlottesville City (@CvilleCityHall)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.\n\nBloom said they'd just relocated to the Toledo, Ohio area from Florence, Kentucky.\n\nDerek Weimer, who taught history to Fields at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Kentucky, said he was a quiet, respectful student but had some \"radical ideas on race.\"\n\n\"He was very infatuated with the Nazis, with Adolf Hitler. He also had a huge military history, especially with German military history and World War II. But, he was pretty infatuated with that stuff.\n\n\"In his freshman year, he had an issue with that that was raised, and from then on we knew that he had those issues. I developed a good rapport with him and used that rapport to constantly try to steer him away from those beliefs to show clear examples -- why that thinking is wrong, why their beliefs were evil, you know, things like that,\" Weimer said.\n\nWarning: The video below contains language and images that may be disturbing to some viewers.\n\nThe vehicle that hit the crowd was purchased in June 2015 from a car dealership in Florence, according to a Carfax report. The vehicle's registration was renewed in Maumee, Ohio in 2016, the report said.\n\nA helicopter crash that killed the pilot and a passenger later in the afternoon outside Charlottesville also was linked to the rally by State Police, though officials did not elaborate on how the crash was connected.\n\nThe chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead.\n\nThe group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.", "time": "09:35:00"}

Zito and Gamber were walking north near the bike lane on Morrison Drive when a vehicle veered to the right, left the lane of travel and struck them, police said on May 1. Police matched vehicle debris found at the scene to a damaged dark grey 2010 Acura TL they discovered in a parking lot near the scene, leading to his arrest.\n\nThe families of both young women and Gentilin attended the Charleston County Magistrate Court bond hearing. Gamber's family came in person and Zito's family appeared online.

a piece of meat, I would never forgive that,\" Frank Zito said through tears and a voice raised with fresh heartbreak. \"He has zero sympathy for life,\" Frank Zito continued. \"He put a hole in our heart that will never be filled.\"\n\nGamber's mother, Arianna Gamber, said Gentilin leaving the scene without helping the victims shows he has no integrity.\n\nClose Buy Now\n\nNicole Gamber, Audrey

(WCBD) - Max Gentilin, charged with hitting and killing two women early Sunday morning on Morrison Drive, has been released from the Al Cannon Detention Center on a $300,000 surety bond.\n\nAffidavits from the Charleston Police Department's investigation into the deadly crash appear to show the 25-year-old Charleston man knew police were looking to speak with him hours after striking the two victims.\n\nLizzy Zito and Ariana Gamber were walking home in the early hours of Sunday morning, according to Zito's family members.\n\n\"It was like 1:15 a.m., she said she was going to be home in 15 minutes and that didn't come; so, we figured the incident was between one and two o'clock in the morning,\" said her father, Frank Zito.\n\nAn investigation by the Charleston Police Department determined a Honda Acura, driven by Gentilin, was traveling north on Morrison Drive around 1:43 a.m. when it ran off the right side of the roadway, struck the two women, and ran onto the curb which had thick brush and foliage.\n\nThe vehicle continued on the raised area along the curb for several feet before reentering the roadway.\n\nAffidavits show the bodies of both victims were found hours later among the foliage with traumatic injuries when a citizen called 9-1-1 around 8:30 a.m. to report seeing two unresponsive victims.\n\nBoth were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nInvestigators said several vehicle parts were found at the crash site. They also observed dark tire markings in the roadway, indicating the vehicle's path of travel. Those markings were consistent with that of a flat tire and led to a parking spot on the street near the Morrison Yard Apartments, not far from the incident location.\n\nAffidavits show the Honda had sustained damage and the right passenger side tire was flat. There were also leaves and twigs on the interior and exterior of the vehicle.\n\nSouth Carolina underbuilt for a decade. Now the Lowcountry is paying for it\n\nVideo obtained from the apartment complex shows a person exiting the driver's side of the vehicle and inspecting the damage. Another shows the man, Gentilin, removing twigs and leaves from outside the vehicle. He can also be heard saying, \"What am I supposed to do?\" according to the documents.\n\nThe affidavit states that Gentilin told a friend that he had struck a tree by the bridge immediately after the crash.\n\nA search of the license plate through the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (SCDMV) came back as registered to an address belonging to Gentilin's parents. They told law enforcement that their son was the driver and in possession of the Honda Acura.\n\nIt was revealed during a Thursday afternoon bond hearing that Gentilin stayed at his parent's home after the crash.\n\nGentilin arrived to work at a downtown Charleston restaurant around 10:00 a.m. Sunday, hours after the deadly crash, according to the affidavits.\n\nThe man's co-workers told investigators that his behavior appeared to be abnormal and out of character, even seeming to be panicked.\n\nCharlotte officer Eyer's wife gives emotional speech at fallen husband's funeral service\n\nAt one point, the affidavit said Gentilin told one of his managers, \"I crashed my car last night and the police are calling me. I need to go handle this.\" He also stated, \"I f -- - up. I f -- - up.\"\n\nGentilin left work about an hour and a half before his scheduled end of shift.\n\nThe victims, both 20, were from Simpsonville in South Carolina's upstate. Family members for Zito said she and Ariana Gamber were in town visiting friends for the weekend.\n\nZito was a psychology major at the College of Charleston with plans to graduate on May 10 after having completed her degree in three years.\n\nCollege leaders described her as being musically talented with a passion for creating music. Her father said Lizzy loved animals and was working at a local clinic.\n\n\"She'd sing every night in the other bedroom with her headset, and she made up her own music, recorded her own music,\" Zito said. \"Lizzy was everyone's heart and soul. Everybody loved her. Our lives will never be the same.\"\n\nNot much is known about Gamber; however, her mother, Nicole Gamber, told News 2 in a phone interview that she \"was in love with life\" and said they were praying that justice would be brought to both families.\n\nGentilin turned himself in to law enforcement on the afternoon of April 30. He was charged with two counts of leaving the scene of an accident causing death and held at the Al Cannon Detention Center.\n\nFamily members of both women spoke during a Thursday afternoon bond hearing and asked for harsh penalties against Gentilin as they sought justice for their daughters.\n\n\"[He] has family here that harbored him since Sunday until yesterday when the warrant was issued. I don't believe that leaving the scene of an accident, abandoning your vehicle, and not turning yourself in shows a lack of flight risk by any means,\" said Gamber.\n\nBear cub filmed in viral video doing well at NC refuge\n\n\"He needs to stay in jail. Those two girls need to have justice. He left them laying [...] he left them there and just dumped the car and didn't turn himself in for days. He has zero sympathy for life for any person in the world. He put a hole in our heart that will never be full,\" Zito said.\n\nThe judge who oversaw the hearing said she had to follow what state law would allow when setting Gentilin's bond.\n\n\"These are terrible cases because I do not have the ability to deny bond. South Carolina law only allows me to deny bond on cases that are deemed violent, and amazingly, this is not one,\" she said.\n\nHe was given a $150,000 bond on each charge for a total surety bond of $300,000. Jail records show he was released from the detention center around 11:00 p.m. Thursday.\n\nIn the affidavits, investigators said that dispatch records indicate Gentilin never attempted to contact law enforcement after the crash, nor did he stay at the scene or render aid to the victims.\n\n\"The defendant was aware that he had been involved in a collision,\" the affidavits state.", "source":

The two \"obviously deceased\" bodies were not found until 8:32 a.m.\n\nThe vehicle's driver, identified by police as Max David Gentilin, continued driving north until he turned at the first right onto Johnson Street and parked at a street parking spot in front of the Morrison Yard apartment complex, according to affidavits.\n\nNews Two 20-year-old-women, including a CofC student, struck and killed on Charleston's peninsula By Kailey Cota kcota@postandcourier.com\n\nVideo captured him exiting the car from the driver's seat, inspecting his Acura for damage and removing twigs and leaves from the outside of the sedan. The car sustained damage to the passenger side of the vehicle and its front, passenger-side tire was flat, according to affidavits.\n\nHair and blood were found along the underbody of the car, affidavits state. They do not specify if hair and blood were visible on the front or side of the vehicle.\n\nThe video recorded the man police identified as Gentilin asking himself \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nAffidavits do not specify what he did after inspecting the damage to the vehicle he drove but is registered in his parents' names, but police said in a May 1 statement that he abandoned the car and fled the scene without rendering aid to the victims.\n\nNews Stretch along Morrison Drive where driver killed 2 women 'desperately needs improvement' By Kailey Cota kcota@postandcourier.com\n\nLater that day, he showed up for his shift at Hall's Chophouse on King Street, according to affidavits. He arrived at work around 10 a.m. \"in a panicked state,\" according to statements from coworkers noted in affidavits. His behavior was \"abnormal and out of character,\" according to the interviews.\n\nHe left work around 1:30 p.m., before his shift ended, after allegedly telling one of his managers that he crashed his car.\n\nNews Families of 2 women hit, killed 'completely destroyed' as alleged driver is granted bond By Kailey Cota kcota@postandcourier.com Today's Top Headlines A proposed mixed-use Lyman development halted and the property is for sale.

I need to go handle this,\" one of his managers said in an interview, according to affidavits. \"I f***** up. I f***** up.\"\n\nA manager at Hall's Chophouse declined to confirm or deny Gentilin's employment, directing questions to the steakhouse's attorney, Cherie Blackburn. Blackburn did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.\n\nGentilin's defense attorney, Chris Adams, restated his sorrow for the families of the victims.\n\n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the two families,\" Adams told The Post and Courier on May 4. \"We're sincere in that. This is a tragic, tragic loss of life for them. We're aware of that and impacted by that.\"\n\nGentilin, who was granted a $300,000 surety bond for his two charges of hit and run with death results and released from jail on May 2, is not expected to appear in court again for another month.\n\n\"This is the very beginning of a long and difficult process,\" Adams continued.\n\nThe families of Zito and Gamber are still fresh with grief.\n\nZito was supposed to graduate from the College of Charleston just two weeks after she was killed. Both girls were looking forward to celebrating their 21st birthdays in May.\n\n\"Had he come forward, had he turned himself in, had he been properly investigated by the police, both of them may still be here,\" Gamber's mother, Nicole Gamber, told reporters on May 2.\n\nZito's father said during the bond hearing that he could forgive an accident, but he can't forgive Gentilin for leaving his child to die.\n\n\"To leave those two girls laying in the street like a piece of meat, I would never forgive that,\" he said through tears. \"He put a hole in our heart that will never be filled.\"",

(WCSC) - Charleston Police say a second man is in custody in connection with an early-morning hit and run last weekend that killed two 20-year-old women.\n\nSeth Alen Gilbert Carlson, 32, of Summerville, is charged with two counts of reckless vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, Sgt. Anthony Gibson said.\n\nPolice said surveillance footage revealed the two victims were struck by two different vehicles: first by Carlson's vehicle and then by a second vehicle driven by Max David Gentilin.\n\nGentilin was arrested last week on two counts of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and has since been released on bond, Gibson said.\n\nThe hit-and-run that occurred at 1:12 a.m. on April 28 near the on-ramp to the Ravenel Bridge, Gibson said.\n\nThe Charleston Police Department received the report of two victims unresponsive just off of Morrison Drive between Harris Street and Cooper Street at 8:32 a.m. on April 28. The victims, who were pronounced dead at the scene, were identified as Lizzy Zito, 20, and Arianna Gamber, 20, both of Simpsonville, according to Chief Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin.\n\nVehicle debris nearby as well as the proximity of the victims to the roadway prompted officers to initiate a hit-and-run investigation. The initial investigation at the scene found a damaged 2010 Acura TL nearby, which was linked to Gentilin.\n\nSurveillance footage showed Carlson's Chevrolet truck striking the victims at 1:12 a.m. when he drove off the roadway as the victims walked near the bike lane of Morrison Drive. Approximately 30 minutes later, they were struck again by Gentilin's vehicle after he drove off the roadway and over the curb, Gibson said.\n\nThe Chevrolet truck was later found abandoned in West Ashley after Carlson reportedly crashed into a ditch and ran away on foot.\n\nCarlson was being held at the Al Cannon Detention Center pending a bond hearing.

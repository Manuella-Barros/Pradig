Grants Pass broadly ended much of the legal ambiguity around public camping and the removal of established encampments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the six-person majority, even cited San Francisco as an example, agreeing with Mayor London Breed that the city's intent with enforcing anti-camping laws was \"not to criminalize homelessness\" but \"to encourage individuals experiencing homelessness to accept services\" and move off the streets.\n\nThe argument, Gorsuch said, came down to whether a city could enact laws against actions, such as public camping, that did not equate to criminalizing a person's status, that of being unhoused. And, the conservative majority concluded, that a city can, much the way municipalities punish drunk driving but do not criminalize alcoholism, and arrest people for illegal drug use even if they are addicts.\n\nHomeless advocates, and the three liberal justices, decried the decision as inhumane, and as giving cities free reign to criminalize the mere act of sleeping in a public space.\n\n\"Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping outside is their only option,\" wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a dissent that she delivered from the bench. \"Punishing people for their status is 'cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\nFederal district Judge Donna Ryu was relying on an earlier Ninth Circuit decision, Martin v. Boise, when she issued her December 2022 injunction against the city of San Francisco, declaring that homeless encampment sweeps of all kinds were unconstitutional, under the Eighth Amendment, when adequate shelter was not available in a city to house everyone who needed it.\n\nBut the Johnson v. Grants Pass decision overturns that precedent, and today the Ninth Circuit vacated that injunction, in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe appellate court upheld, however, a stipulation Ryu had made about the city complying with its own \"bag and tag\" policy with regard to unattended belongings that are found in an encampment sweep.\n\nThe city is supposed to bag and label all luggage and other belongings and leave a note at the site of an encampment instructing possible owners where they can retrieve those belongings, at a Public Works storage facility. Those belongings must be kept there for 90 days. The Coalition on Homelessness has long contended that these policies are not carefully followed, and that individuals' belongings are frequently lost or destroyed when encampments are cleaned out.\n\n\"We appreciate that the Ninth Circuit panel took quick action to ensure the preliminary injunction in San Francisco is in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Grants Pass,\" said City Attorney David Chiu in a statement. \"This will give our City more flexibility to provide services to unhoused people while keeping our streets healthy and safe. It will help us address our most challenging encampments, where services are often refused and re-encampment is common.\"\n\nLast summer, the city had sought modification to the lower court's injunction from the Ninth Circuit, which they denied. However in their brief ruling, the Ninth Circuit clarified that the city was only violating the injunction in the case of \"involuntary homelessness,\" which meant that encampments could be cleared if offers of shelter were made to the individuals there, and those offers were refused.\n\nThe new ruling then, essentially, allows encampment clearing to go on without necessarily making offers of shelter.\n\nThe original case brought in the fall of 2022, Coalition on Homelessness, et al. v. City and County of San Francisco, through which Ryu's injunction came to be, may now be significantly hindered. However, the case won't go to trial for another nine months, and the ACLU, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, is not backing down.\n\n\"Because the city has a history of not keeping its word, we'll be watching closely,\" said John Do, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, following the Supreme Court decision. \"San Francisco should not interpret this ruling as a green light to unlawfully crack down on unhoused residents and instead must commit to moving more people off the streets and into affordable housing or emergency shelter.\"\n\nThe ACLU further noted that the Grants Pass decision \"addressed only one of 13 claims in Coalition on Homelessness v. City of San Francisco.\"\n\n\"The Grants Pass case did not address the city's pattern of destroying property, its failure to provide accommodations for people with disabilities, nor whether the methods used to clear encampments unlawfully endanger people's lives,\" the organization said in a release. \"These claims remain unresolved and will be at issue when the case goes to trial in May 2025.\"", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drunk driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

Johnson, when it held that a city enforcing generally-applicable shelter laws, even in the absence of available shelter beds, is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause.\n\nNoting that homelessness could be the \"defining\" public safety and health crisis in the West Coast, the court said that encampments force adults and children to \"navigate around used needles, human waste, and other hazards to make their way to school, the grocery store, or work.\" The three liberal justices dissented from that ruling, warning that it would lead to vulnerable homeless people needing to either \"either stay awake or be arrested.\"\n\nThe Ninth Circuit on Monday cited the Grants Pass ruling when it lifted a district court's injunction blocking San Francisco from clearing homeless encampments. The Ninth Circuit's action came as homelessness and drug issues have taken a central role in the city's heated mayoral race, and as voters have expressed frustration at the city's national reputation crisis, as the Sun has reported.\n\n\"We appreciate that the Ninth Circuit panel took quick action to ensure the preliminary injunction in San Francisco is in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Grants Pass,\" San Francisco's city attorney, David Chiu, said in a statement, adding that it will help keep city streets safe. \"It will help us address our most challenging encampments, where services are often refused and re-encampment is common.\"\n\nThe city had argued that the lower court's \"sweeping\" injunction, which prohibited the city from enforcing rules that prohibit sleeping and camping on public property until the city had shelter capacity for each homeless person, had placed the city in an \"impossible situation.\"\n\nThe thousands of homeless people sleeping on city streets in tents and sleeping bags \"block sidewalks, prevent employees from cleaning public thoroughfares, and create health and safety risks,\" the city argued, noting that local residents needed access to those public spaces as well.\n\n\"Often encampments exist just outside of apartment buildings, schools, and other community buildings, forcing families with children and persons with disabilities to navigate them.\" The city also argued that elected lawmakers should determine homeless policy, rather than sweeping court orders -- a position the Supreme Court recently agreed with when it noted that \"a handful of federal judges\" can't begin to match \"the collective wisdom of the American people\" and their representatives to determine pressing homelessness questions.\n\nThe homeless advocates opposing San Francisco had said that the city's ordinances punished \"hundreds of involuntarily homeless individuals each year simply for existing in public\" and said the city had \"threatened, cited, and arrested\" thousands of homeless people for the \"mere status\" of not having a home.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"},

The Supreme Court ruled in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson that localities have the ability to ban homeless encampments on public property.\n\nThe ruling states that the city must collect any personal property and allow individuals to retrieve it for up to 90 days. Officers are also required to leave a note at the cleared site identifying where the property can be found.\n\nThe court also upheld that the city had the right to enforce its policy, shrugging off pleas from city officials asking that they not be forced to follow the new guidelines, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n\"This decision by the Supreme Court will help cities like San Francisco manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently,\" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement following the Supreme Court decision, adding that she hopes the city will remove all tent camps from its streets. \"We will continue to offer shelter, but we will not allow those who reject offers of help to remain where they are.\"\n\nHomelessness in San Francisco rose 7% from 2022 to 2024 despite the city spending $676 million on the issue in the 2022-2023 fiscal year.

Poor conditions led residents in one of the city's most crime-ridden neighborhoods to file a lawsuit against the city for its failure to tackle crime and blaming the city for allowing an open-air drug market to fester.\n\nBreed's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716853", "eventUri": "eng-9716853", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

You can't even walk around down there.\" When a panelist disputed this claim, Barkley retorted \"yeah, with a bulletproof vest and security.\" Barkley is right. San Francisco, once a glorious city, is now a cesspool of homeless encampments, human waste, drugs, needles, and rampant crime.\n\nGrants Pass is a small city in eastern Oregon, far less famous than San Francisco. Like its neighbor to the south, however, Grants Pass is dealing with the same problem: homeless encampments. To put a stop to this lunacy, Grants Pass officials instituted a system to end camping in public areas. Initial violations could result in a $295 fine. Subsequent violations could lead to an order banning that individual from the park for 30 days. Anyone who violated that order could face a charge of criminal trespassing, punishable by up to 30 days' imprisonment and a $1,250 fine.\n\nRadical attorneys for homeless people challenged this new Grants Pass ordinance, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Clarke-who is not even a Senate-confirmed and presidentially appointed Article III judge-issued an injunction against the city. Clinton U.S. Circuit Judge Ronald Gould and Clinton U.S. Senior District Judge Roslyn Silver (sitting by designation) on the Ninth Circuit upheld the injunction holding the homeless-encampment ban (somehow) constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated the Eighth Amendment. The 2-1 Ninth Circuit panel reasoned the public camping ban punished the status of homelessness because sleeping is biologically necessary. As Trump U.S. Circuit Judge Daniel Collins explained in his dissent, the Ninth Circuit's ruling was absurd. Urinating and defecating are biological necessities. Do cities have to allow homeless people to be able to do those things in public, too\n\nFirst, the ordinance did not punish homeless people for being homeless. It punished them for camping in public. In recent months, we have seen nationwide pro-Hamas encampments at universities. The Grants Pass ordinance would punish these protesters, many of whom are rich students, in the same way as homeless people.\n\nGrants Pass appealed to the Supreme Court. Three leftist justices -- Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson -- said that Grants Pass violated the Eighth Amendment. Justice Sotomayor made the absurd argument that public camping can't be illegal because sleep is a \"biological necessity, not a crime.\" Defecating is also a biological necessity, but public defecation is a crime throughout the nation. Fortunately for Grants Pass, these liberal justices had to dissent, because the Court has six sane justices, who held that municipalities can indeed ban public camping.\n\nIn his opinion for the Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that the policy debate surrounding homelessness is a complex one. Still, he reasoned, federal courts are not the proper forum for resolving that debate. Instead, of course, the people and their elected representatives determine the best way to deal with the problem.\n\nIt's easy to envision a world where the result in Grants Pass comes out differently. After Justice Antonin Scalia died, President Obama nominated then-Judge Merrick Garland, who now serves as President Biden's Attorney General, to fill the vacancy. Had the Senate confirmed him, the Court would resemble the leftist Ninth Circuit. Every public park in America could become a dystopian wasteland of homeless encampments, drugs, needles, booze bottles, feces, trash, and other filth-instead of safe spaces for parents and kids.\n\nFortunately, the Senate, under the leadership of Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Chuck Grassley, refused to hold a hearing on Garland's nomination. That opened the door for President Donald Trump to appoint three constitutionalist justices who all voted to uphold the public-camping ban. There is little doubt that Garland, who weaponizes the Justice Department against Trump and other conservatives, would vote to strike it down.\n\nThe Supreme Court is at stake in the upcoming presidential election. Joe Biden has attacked the Court and pledged to appoint leftist justices like Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who voted to permanently prevent cities from cleaning up homeless encampments riddled with drugs, needles, trash, feces, and other filth. While issues like abortion receive a lot of attention, the Court deals with many other cases that dramatically affect our lives.\n\nIf the leftist justices got their way, the people of Grants Pass, San Francisco, and every other American city would have to continue to live with these filthy homeless encampments. Instead, officials can clean up their cities and shut down the encampments. Elections matter; judges matter. The current leftist bloc on the Supreme Court is too radical even for San Francisco. If Democrats were to have their way, that leftist bloc could become a majority and ruin the country we all love. Vote accordingly on November 5th.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_davis@townhall.com", "name": "Mike Davis", "type": "author",

The Supreme Court ruled in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson that localities have the ability to ban homeless encampments on public property.\n\nThe ruling states that the city must collect any personal property and allow individuals to retrieve it for up to 90 days. Officers are also required to leave a note at the cleared site identifying where the property can be found. (RELATED: California Cops Stand Idly By As Men Expose Themselves, Pee On Each Other At Event Open To Kids)\n\nThe court also upheld that the city had the right to enforce its policy, shrugging off pleas from city officials asking that they not be forced to follow the new guidelines, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n\"This decision by the Supreme Court will help cities like San Francisco manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently,\" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement following the Supreme Court decision, adding that she hopes the city will remove all tent camps from its streets. \"We will continue to offer shelter, but we will not allow those who reject offers of help to remain where they are.\"\n\nHomelessness in San Francisco rose 7% from 2022 to 2024 despite the city spending $676 million on the issue in the 2022-2023 fiscal year. The city is working to increase housing to combat the rising homeless population but is observably falling short of its plan to build 82,000 new housing units by 2031, having reportedly issued only 7 new housing permits in the first two months of 2024.\n\nThe rise in homelessness has led to surging crime in the city and over 32,000 complaints of human feces on the streets in 2023 alone, prompting action to remove the camps. Poor conditions led residents in one of the city's most crime-ridden neighborhoods to file a lawsuit against the city for its failure to tackle crime and blaming the city for allowing an open-air drug market to fester.\n\nBreed's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And the board removed an exception that had allowed camping during evening hours if there were not enough shelter beds available.\n\nThe vote, which will make it easier for city officials to remove encampments on public sidewalks and parks, was a priority for Mayor Jay Ruais, a Republican who was elected in November. And it heralds a potential shift in the way New Hampshire cities and towns approach homelessness after the Supreme Court ruling, critics say.\n\nIn the case, City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson, the court ruled along ideological lines, 6-3, that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not prevent a municipality from evicting homeless people from public spaces -- and that there is no requirement that those municipalities secure adequate shelter housing for them before carrying out such an eviction.\n\nBut even as cities like Manchester move toward enforcement actions, the ACLU and other New Hampshire civil rights groups say there are still avenues to stop those actions in state law. And they have urged cities and towns to move cautiously and humanely.\n\n\"We continue to warn New Hampshire officials and law enforcement that efforts to criminalize the unhoused may still violate the N.H. Constitution -- and we'll be watching,\" Henry Klementowicz, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, said in a statement.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling is a major swing in policy for cities like Manchester. Before last month, many municipalities and states followed the lead of a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision: Martin v. Boise.\n\nIn that decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco held that it would constitute \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment for a government body to force out a homeless person from a public property if there were no reasonable alternatives for that person to find shelter.\n\nEvictions could happen only if beds or shelter were available to those who were being evicted, the Ninth Circuit held.\n\nThe decision did not have direct legal power over New Hampshire, which is under the jurisdiction of the First Circuit Court of Appeals. But it still influenced homelessness policy, noted Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU, in an interview.\n\nAfter Martin v. Boise, cities and towns were more cautious when it came to eviction attempts, Bissonnette said. And city councilors in Manchester passed the ordinance that allowed camping in public spaces when there is no shelter space available.\n\n\"Many cities and towns -- though that's not binding in New Hampshire -- were basically applying that principle, and I think to their credit,\" Bissonnette said. \"Saying 'we're not going to cite people or evict people from public places unless there is some shelter space available.' \"\n\nManchester's ordinance did not prevent all evictions. In January, the city removed a homeless encampment on a sidewalk, in a move that was later upheld by the Hillsborough County Superior Court after the judge found there was adequate shelter elsewhere. But the ordinance did require more deliberation and care, advocates say.\n\nThe Grants Pass decision struck a fatal blow to the Martin v. Boise precedent. In it, conservative justices directly rejected plaintiffs' arguments that evicting someone without offering an alternative housing option is unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the board of aldermen vote, Ruais hailed the change, arguing in a statement that it would allow the city to \"make our streets safe, clean, and passable.\" But he vowed to address homelessness in other areas.\n\n\"We must address this challenge in a comprehensive way, and we have already undertaken 11 initiatives to address the underlying drivers of homelessness and the need for more affordable housing in our city,\" he said.\n\nAs some housing advocates privately worry about large-scale clearouts, Bissonnette says he believes such actions could still be challenged. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on the U.S. Constitution, the state constitution could still prevent similar evictions, he says.\n\nNew Hampshire has its own version of the Eighth Amendment. Article 33 of Part I of the state constitution states that: \"No Magistrate, or Court of Law, shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.\"\n\nUnlike the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" the state constitution uses the word \"or,\" Bissonnette said, which could make it easier to apply.\n\n\"We have always taken the position that our state constitution provides more protections than the Eighth Amendment,\" Bissonnette said.\n\nAnd he noted that at least one superior court judge appears to agree. When Manchester attempted to clear out homeless people on Pine and Manchester streets in January, the ACLU and N.H. Legal Assistance sued the city in an attempt to get an injunction to stop the action.\n\nJudge John C. Kissinger ultimately rejected that attempt, but in his order he also stated: \"If there were no safe alternatives available, the Court would agree that forced removal of the encampment would likely violate the State and federal constitutional rights of the people residing in the encampment.\"\n\nIn that case, Kissinger held that there had been safe alternatives, pointing to the city's contention that month that 31 beds were available at the Cashin Senior Activity Center and three beds at a facility run by Families in Transition, and that a warming shelter was available at the 1269 Caf\u00e9.\n\nBut legal rights groups say Kissinger's order could open the door to applying Article 33 against homeless evictions in cases where there weren't enough shelter beds. The Grants Pass decision does not apply to the state constitution.\n\nIt is unclear how the state Supreme Court might rule on the Article 33 argument. In the meantime, legal groups are increasing their political appeals.\n\nIn a letter sent shortly before the July 2 board of aldermen vote, the ACLU and NHLA urged Manchester to show restraint, and wrote that incarcerating homeless people \"only fuels mass incarceration, keeping people in an endless cycle of poverty, and institutionalization.\"\n\n\"Whatever the United States Supreme Court may say about the Eighth Amendment, elected officials have always had a choice,\" the letter states. \"They can decide to invest in solutions -- like safe, long-term housing and low-barrier shelters, as well as wraparound services and voluntary mental health and substance use treatment -- which will increase people's chances of obtaining employment and housing.\"\n\nRuais and others say they are moving forward intentionally and humanely.\n\n\"If an individual wants and needs help, it is available,\" he said in a statement. \"However, anyone choosing to ignore our ordinances or break the law, will be subject to the applicable legal consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

Gavin Newsom said in a statement.\n\nActivists and many other politicians, meanwhile, condemned it as a shameful criminalization of homelessness -- an added cruelty for those who have nowhere else to go.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath slammed the decision and vowed to fight, or perhaps, ignore it.\n\n\"As the Chair of [the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority] and the Board of Supervisors I want to be crystal clear: The criminalization of homelessness and poverty is dangerous. It does not work. And it will not stand in Los Angeles County,\" Ms. Horvath said in a statement.\n\nBenjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California, told The Epoch Times that while \"most people saw this coming,\" it doesn't change the underlying political calculus, which includes ideological battles around mental health and addiction treatment and affordable housing.\n\n\"If a politician is really getting pressure to clear a specific encampment, yes that can happen easier,\" said Mr. Henwood, who led the Los Angeles Homeless Authority's 2024 Point-in-Time homeless count.\n\n\"What remains to be seen, and it's more of an empirical question, then becomes, does enforcement in one area drive people to other areas? That's something we'll see in the data,\" Mr. Henwood said.\n\nLike Santa Monica and Long Beach, Antelope Valley is an \"end-of-line\" destination, where transit bus and train lines terminate. Such municipalities have sometimes complained that their transient and permanent homeless populations swell as the lines are used as makeshift shelters and as riders must exit on the last service for cleaning and maintenance.\n\nSpeaking to The Epoch Times in March, Santa Monica Mayor Phil Brock said the city receives an estimated six homeless people almost every hour of the day, and an additional 50 to 75 from the last train each night. \"That's an extra hundred people or more a day wandering around our city. So we are in crisis in Santa Monica,\" Mr. Brock said.\n\nAnxieties about any attempts, even theoretical, to export the crisis run high, with such suggestions raising the ire of local officials -- like when L.A. Mayor Karen Bass alluded to the idea of available land to build \"homeless villages\" in outer areas like Lancaster.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether enforcement in neighboring areas will push more homeless people toward rural and unincorporated areas, or continue to corral them in service-dense epicenters in the city of Los Angeles, like Skid Row.\n\nSome smaller cities, like nearby El Cajon, have already been enforcing such bans, managing to build enough shelter to get around lower court decisions in the Grants Pass case, according to Mayor Bill Wells, who has been an outspoken critic of housing-first and harm-reduction orthodoxy, arguing instead for mandated mental health and addiction treatment to address the crisis.\n\nMr. Brock, the Santa Monica mayor, told the Epoch Times in an email that his city has also been enforcing its own ban and was not subject to lower court rulings because it has enough available beds.\n\nMany local governments have issued statements indicating they are reviewing the ruling in concert with legal counsel before announcing any potential policy changes.\n\nNinth Circuit rulings that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cities from punishing the homeless from sleeping on public property were in practice interpreted broadly, effectively banning some jurisdictions from regulating encampments in the absence of \"adequate\" shelter beds for their entire population.\n\nSome jurisdictions, like Orange County, found a way around this by obtaining a District Court's consent decree and agreeing to build more shelters, while others, like San Diego, came up with new laws to try to comply with those rulings.\n\nCourt orders had prevented several cities -- including Sacramento and San Francisco, from enforcing existing codes to clear encampments.\n\nAnd while the decision presumably frees municipalities to legally enforce local codes, it doesn't address all existing legal challenges, just the Eighth Amendment claim. Some activists said they will continue to pursue legal action against cities for infringing on homeless rights.\n\n\"Today's shameful decision guts a key civil rights protection for unhoused people, but it will not derail our lawsuit against San Francisco, which has policies and an ordinance requiring the city to offer shelter before clearing encampments,\" John Do, senior attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, said in a joint statement with San Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness.\n\nBut San Francisco Mayor London Breed said the issue is more about individuals who refuse such offers, and the ruling will allow the city to address entrenched encampments. The city will continue to \"lead with offers of services,\" including \"new tools like expanded conservatorship\" to compel those struggling with addiction and mental illness, she said in a statement.\n\n\"Those who refuse our help or those who already have shelter will not be allowed to camp on our streets. It's not healthy, safe, or compassionate for people on the street and it's not acceptable for our neighborhoods,\" Ms. Breed said.\n\nSan Francisco has become a magnet for drug tourism, which has both expanded and complicated its homeless crisis.\n\nDivisions and confusion also emerged in other states such as Oregon, where some leaders are looking to the state Legislature to revise existing laws in the wake of Grants Pass.\n\n\"If the state and courts continue to interfere with cities' ability to govern their streets, we will continue to be overrun by migratory homeless and encampments, especially as cities in other states are allowed to push it out of their communities,\" he said.\n\nPortland has been hit with legal challenges from both sides -- homeless residents suing to prevent camping bans, and disability advocates suing for allowing tents and tarps on public sidewalks.\n\nIn its amicus brief, the city tried to walk the line between not criminalizing homelessness but maintaining the ability to regulate public spaces. It clearly denounced the lower court's \"insupportable lack of clarity\" and infringement of their ability to regulate public safety and health.\n\nMs. Bass expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court ruling, arguing in a statement \"it must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail.\"\n\nIn a written statement, L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger echoed Mr. Newsom's cautious support, and diverged from Ms. Horvath's condemnation of the ruling, which she said will empower governments to make \"judicious decisions\" about when to enforce.\n\n\"We must also be balanced in our approach to enforcement so that communities can enjoy public spaces taken over by homeless encampments,\" Ms. Barger said.\n\nDespite such divergences, according to a source familiar with the subject who spoke on background as they were not authorized to discuss the matter, the county and the city of Los Angeles are all very much \"in alignment\" when it comes to a shared approach -- which includes offers of housing and support services over extended time periods in order to build trust with people living on the streets.\n\nThe expense and delay associated with building new housing, and the dearth of available emergency shelter, means that there has often been no third option to triage people and get them off the streets.\n\nL.A. Mayor Bass's interim housing program, Inside Safe, which clears encampments by placing people in motels as a path to permanent housing, was meant to address that.\n\nBut overall, the total number of homeless in the county decreased by around 206 people, while the city's homeless population decreased by around 1,008 people.\n\nJohn Moorlach, a former Orange County supervisor, stressed such point-in-time counts are an estimate.\n\n\"It's really hard to count them,\" said Mr. Moorlach, who was the inaugural chair for Orange County's count in 2007 and helped run it through 2013.\n\n\"We were not permitted to knock on car windows. We did the [count] at 5 a.m., so it was still dark, and we could see cars with towels blocking the windows, but we were not permitted to knock,\" he said. \"It's not an exact science.\"\n\nMr. Moorlach called the results \"good news,\" but not shocking, given an overall decline or flatlining in California's cities. \"The population of cities are declining. ... I'd say, based on data, that the homelessness population should be declining, on the norm.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, L.A. County had the highest numeric population decline of all U.S. counties at 56,420 -- or a negative 0.58 percent growth rate -- in 2023, due to negative domestic migration.\n\nWith a $1.3 billion budget and around 1,000 fewer homeless people, the city's overall reduction averages out to around $1.3 million spent per person helped out of homelessness.\n\nIf you extrapolate that, Mr. Moorlach said, the result is hardly sustainable. \"How many billions would it cost, to finally not have homeless people?\"\n\nThere is also the question of how far those efforts and programs are actually reaching.\n\nHowever, the study also found only around half of people counted had recently engaged with a case manager or outreach worker, and 45 percent reported never having received an offer of shelter or housing.\n\nAround half of those surveyed also reported chronic mental illness, physical illness, and substance abuse issues.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Ms. Park appeared to draw a line in the sand.\n\n\"If we don't course correct on our own policies, things are likely to get worse before they get better. If we allow people to camp wherever they want, for as long as they want, regardless of whether they've been offered services or a place to go, we are likely to see other cities, other regions, and other states pushing their homeless problems right into L.A.,\" Ms. Park said.\n\nMs. Park led a motion in the City Council June 28 asking the City Attorney to report back on how the Grants Pass decision impacts three existing ordinances that restrict sleeping, storing property, and camping in public spaces, and a recent legal settlement in which it has agreed to return public spaces to intended use and reduce encampments.\n\n\"Stay tuned, because things are about to get interesting!\" she said.\n\nUnder settlement terms with the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, the city is to create immediate shelter and treatment beds -- all in line with specific targets and deadlines.\n\nAs of March 31, a quarterly progress report showed every single one of the city's 15 council districts is behind those targets by hundreds if not thousands of beds.\n\n\"Enforcement should always be a last resort, but it must be an option on the table. Cities no longer have an excuse to tolerate the most egregious of issues like open-air drug use and human trafficking,\" wrote Elizabeth Mitchell, lead attorney for the group.\n\nIn an emailed statement to The Epoch Times, the Los Angeles Police Department said it continued to support \"a whole of government approach,\" reiterating its commitment to partnering with the mayor and city departments and stakeholders in a \"collective effort.\"\n\nDeon Joseph, a law enforcement officer in Los Angeles who has worked on Skid Row for more than two decades, expressed cautious optimism that the court's ruling will save lives.\n\n\"We all know homelessness is not a crime, but we cannot ignore the criminal fallout that is spurned from allowing encampments to go unchecked. It only served to increase overdosing, sexual assaults and exploitation, drug and weapons sales and the degradation of the quality of life, not just for the homeless but for all,\" Mr. Joseph said in a statement to The Epoch Times.\n\n\"The hands-off approach has literally killed people I've known for decades who I tried to help, through enforcement,\" Mr. Joseph said. \"It appears cities now have the freedom to engage in both.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson and Smith v. Spizzirri, a dispute over the constitutionality of ordinances that bar people who are homeless from camping on city streets. (Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last month to allow an Oregon city's efforts to clear out homeless encampments is already rippling through New Hampshire.\n\nOn July 2, the Manchester Board of Mayor and Aldermen voted to strengthen a ban on camping on city property, subjecting people to fines. And the board removed an exception that had allowed camping during evening hours if there were not enough shelter beds available.\n\nThe vote, which will make it easier for city officials to remove encampments on public sidewalks and parks, was a priority for Mayor Jay Ruais, a Republican who was elected in November. And it heralds a potential shift in the way New Hampshire cities and towns approach homelessness after the Supreme Court ruling, critics say.\n\nIn the case, City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson, the court ruled along ideological lines, 6-3, that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not prevent a municipality from evicting homeless people from public spaces - and that there is no requirement that those municipalities secure adequate shelter housing for them before carrying out such an eviction.\n\nBut even as cities like Manchester move toward enforcement actions, the ACLU and other New Hampshire civil rights groups say there are still avenues to stop those actions in state law. And they have urged cities and towns to move cautiously and humanely.\n\n\"We continue to warn New Hampshire officials and law enforcement that efforts to criminalize the unhoused may still violate the New Hampshire Constitution - and we'll be watching,\" Henry Klementowicz, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, said in a statement.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling is a major swing in policy for cities like Manchester. Before last month, many municipalities and states followed the lead of a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision: Martin v. Boise.\n\nIn that decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco held that it would constitute \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment for a government body to force out a homeless person from a public property if there were no reasonable alternatives for that person to find shelter.\n\nEvictions could happen only if beds or shelter were available to those who were being evicted, the Ninth Circuit held.\n\nThe decision did not have direct legal power over New Hampshire, which is under the jurisdiction of the First Circuit Court of Appeals. But it still influenced homelessness policy, noted Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU, in an interview.\n\nAfter Martin v. Boise, cities and towns were more cautious when it came to eviction attempts, Bissonnette said. And city councilors in Manchester passed the ordinance that allowed camping in public spaces when there is no shelter space available.\n\n\"Many cities and towns - though that's not binding in New Hampshire - were basically applying that principle, and I think to their credit,\" Bissonnette said. \"Saying 'we're not going to cite people or evict people from public places unless there is some shelter space available.'\"\n\nManchester's ordinance did not prevent all evictions. In January, the city removed a homeless encampment on a sidewalk, in a move that was later upheld by the Hillsborough County Superior Court after the judge found there was adequate shelter elsewhere. But the ordinance did require more deliberation and care, advocates say.\n\nThe Grants Pass decision struck a fatal blow to the Martin v. Boise precedent. In it, conservative justices directly rejected plaintiffs' arguments that evicting someone without offering an alternative housing option is unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the board of aldermen vote, Ruais hailed the change, arguing in a statement that it would allow the city to \"make our streets safe, clean, and passable.\" But he vowed to address homelessness in other areas.\n\n\"We must address this challenge in a comprehensive way, and we have already undertaken 11 initiatives to address the underlying drivers of homelessness and the need for more affordable housing in our city,\" he said.\n\nAs some housing advocates privately worry about large-scale clearouts, Bissonnette says he believes such actions could still be challenged. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on the U.S. Constitution, the state constitution could still prevent similar evictions, he says.\n\nNew Hampshire has its own version of the Eighth Amendment. Article 33 of Part I of the state constitution states that: \"No Magistrate, or Court of Law, shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.\"\n\nUnlike the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" the state constitution uses the word \"or,\" Bissonnette said, which could make it easier to apply.\n\n\"We have always taken the position that our state constitution provides more protections than the Eighth Amendment,\" Bissonnette said.\n\nAnd he noted that at least one superior court judge appears to agree. When Manchester attempted to clear out homeless people on Pine and Manchester streets in January, the ACLU and New Hampshire Legal Assistance sued the city in an attempt to get an injunction to stop the action.\n\nJudge John C. Kissinger ultimately rejected that attempt, but in his order he also stated: \"If there were no safe alternatives available, the Court would agree that forced removal of the encampment would likely violate the State and federal constitutional rights of the people residing in the encampment.\"\n\nIn that case, Kissinger held that there had been safe alternatives, pointing to the city's contention that month that 31 beds were available at the Cashin Senior Activity Center and three beds at a facility run by Families in Transition, and that a warming shelter was available at the 1269 Caf\u00e9.\n\nBut legal rights groups say Kissinger's order could open the door to applying Article 33 against homeless evictions in cases where there weren't enough shelter beds. The Grants Pass decision does not apply to the state constitution.\n\nIt is unclear how the state Supreme Court might rule on the Article 33 argument. In the meantime, legal groups are increasing their political appeals.\n\nIn a letter sent shortly before the July 2 board of aldermen vote, the ACLU and NHLA urged Manchester to show restraint, and wrote that incarcerating homeless people \"only fuels mass incarceration, keeping people in an endless cycle of poverty, and institutionalization.\"\n\n\"Whatever the United States Supreme Court may say about the Eighth Amendment, elected officials have always had a choice,\" the letter states. \"They can decide to invest in solutions - like safe, long-term housing and low-barrier shelters, as well as wraparound services and voluntary mental health and substance use treatment - which will increase people's chances of obtaining employment and housing.\"\n\nRuais and others say they are moving forward intentionally and humanely.\n\n\"If an individual wants and needs help, it is available,\" he said in a statement. \"However, anyone choosing to ignore our ordinances or break the law, will be subject to the applicable legal consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_dewitt@yahoo.com", "name": "Ethan DeWitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

But those claims relied on a key legal precedent that fining or jailing people for public camping when there isn't enough shelter available amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, which is prohibited under the Eighth Amendment. With the precedent now overturned by the Supreme Court, the viability of that approach is in question.\n\n\"We've lost a really important tool in our toolbox,\" said Brigitte Nicoletti, a staff attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center, who's worked on encampment litigation. \"You're also seeing the fact that advocates are not going to stop advocating. You may have lost one tool, but we have a lot more.\"\n\nNicoletti isn't involved in the Oakland case but has followed it closely in light of the Supreme Court decision. Before that ruling, she said attorneys would likely have relied at least in part on an Eighth Amendment claim in fighting an eviction like this one.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case instead argue the eviction will expose them to state-created danger, a violation of the 14th Amendment, and allege the city is violating their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs also argue the city is violating the terms of a settlement agreement that prohibits sweeps during extreme weather. There is a heat advisory in place for the Bay Area until Friday.\n\n\"Failing to provide shelter options to unhoused people that meet their disability-related needs ... means that shelter is functionally unavailable to them,\" the complaint reads.\n\nOne resident, Michael Avery, had AIDS and has other underlying conditions that make a congregate shelter a threat to his life, the attorneys argue. Another has a serious brain injury that affects his memory, and he takes care of his father who lives at the camp and has dementia, a condition they say makes it unsafe for him to live at the tiny home community the city is offering.\n\n\"They have illnesses that if they were to go into these shelters would kill them,\" Henson said.\n\nThe eviction follows a two-year campaign by the San Francisco Boardsailing Association to get the camp cleared. On its website, the organization said the camp has \"created an epicenter for car break-ins while increased trash and direct sewage runoff have been flowing directly into the waters there.\"\n\nHenson believes that effort may have spurred BCDC's letter threatening fines to the city. The agency did not respond to questions about the role of those complaints in its actions.\n\nWhile less tested, the ADA claim may prove to be a powerful tool to block encampment evictions, Nicoletti noted, although it doesn't provide blanket protection applicable to a whole community the way the Eighth Amendment protections did. Instead, she said courts require detailed analysis of each person's disabilities and whether or not the city is accommodating them.\n\nBoth Nicoletti and homeless advocate Robbie Powelson, who's been involved in several lawsuits over encampment sweeps in the Bay Area, have found success stalling sweeps using state-created harm arguments in the past.\n\n\"Cities are going to perceive that they have a blank check to steamroll people's rights,\" Powelson said. \"There's many rights that still exist and are enforceable.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, the Supreme Court ruling has already affected an ongoing lawsuit filed by unhoused residents over the city's homelessness policies. The Eighth Amendment claims in the suit no longer hold water, but the suit will move forward based on its other 13 claims. Earlier this week, a temporary injunction barring the city from enforcing laws against public camping without first offering a shelter bed was vacated.\n\n\"If the city follows its own policies, we should continue to see offers of shelter prior to any kind of enforcement,\" said Nisha Kashyap, an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, who represents the plaintiffs. \"Now, our clients brought this lawsuit because there was a gap between what the city said it was doing and what it actually was doing.\"\n\nOther cities, including Oakland, have policies requiring officials to make shelter offers before clearing camps, but Nicoletti said the Supreme Court's ruling makes it challenging to enforce those.\n\n\"It's harder and sometimes slower to hold the city accountable for following its own policies when there's no teeth behind it,\" she said.\n\nIn Berkeley, city leaders are considering a resolution reaffirming the city will not take additional steps to criminalize unhoused people in the wake of the Supreme Court decision.\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing in the Oakland case, Senior District Judge Susan Illston asked whether the city had offered residents shelter, to which Deputy City Attorney Jamilah Jefferson responded, \"Everyone has been offered shelter. Whether or not they have accepted is a different story.\" She noted camp residents were first given notice in May that they'd have to move.\n\nHarold Duffey, assistant city administrator and acting homeless administrator, emphasized that the shelter being offered was only a temporary entry point to a service system that would eventually secure residents permanent housing.\n\nHenson said that assessment missed the point.\n\n\"The issue here is not about whether they offered an option, it's about whether that option is reasonably accessible,\" she said, calling the city's offer of group shelter a \"death sentence\" for the medically fragile residents.\n\n\"The city is under no obligation to fundamentally alter its programs to address the needs of all individuals,\" Jefferson later said.\n\nThe judge ultimately ordered the residents to discuss their needs with outreach workers, and outreach workers to make accommodations where feasible, and to report their progress to the court by Wednesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KQED"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So, we want to make sure that when they do come to the yard, we can give them everything that was taken from them,\" said Garc\u00eda.\n\nTo retrieve their items, people have to physically go to the Public Works yard and show their ID along with the tag left behind by the city.", "source": {"uri": "abc7news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Containerization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_on_Homelessness,_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGO_(AM)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KGO (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGO-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KGO-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backpack"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15047534_070924-kgo-sf-homeless-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716853", "eventUri": "eng-9716853", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

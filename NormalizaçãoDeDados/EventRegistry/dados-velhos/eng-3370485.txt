Answers remain unclear, but doctors who have spent decades treating sick kids in the area say the incident is a symptom of a greater problem: Chronic mismanagement, corruption and outright negligence are worsening encephalitis outbreaks that sicken thousands of children every year.\n\nThirty-three children died Aug. 10 and 11 at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, around the time there was a disruption in the oxygen supply. A team of experts sent from New Delhi concluded that the interruption was not responsible for the deaths, but that has failed to quell national fury in India over how the hospital allowed oxygen to run out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even expressed sympathy to the children's families this week during his Independence Day speech.\n\nDoctors say they hope the national spotlight will force officials to focus on another hugely neglected problem: encephalitis, which has killed more than 4,000 children and sickened nearly 25,000 since 2010 in Uttar Pradesh, where the hospital is located. Some of the children who died had the brain-swelling condition.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a catch-all term to describe patients suffering fever, vomiting, headaches and brain function issues such as confusion, trouble speaking and coma along with seizures. The condition can leave surviving children paralyzed and mentally impaired.\n\nOutbreaks can be timed every year to the monsoon rains that leave swaths of coffee-colored flood waters standing in fields and licking at roadways in impoverished parts of the country's major rice-growing region. Yet much about the disease remains a mystery or a matter of debate.\n\n\"If there is more rain, the cases are more,\" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, the Gorakhpur hospital's former head who retired two years ago after working more than three decades as a pediatrician there. \"If there is less rain, the cases are less.\"\n\nThough it's not proven, Kushwaha suspects germs spread through fecal matter in dirty water may be related to the outbreaks, along with overall poor sanitation and improper toilet facilities and practices in the country's most populous state. But he insists the root cause is empty government promises and neglect in an area where health infrastructure and funding are poor and medical understaffing is high.\n\n\"We are just treating the fire, but we are not doing anything to prevent the fire and extinguish the fire,\" he said. \"In India, the corruption is so rampant that it has become a normal routine.\"\n\nA lack of testing capabilities makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the cause of many encephalitis cases. Often, children with other identifiable diseases get lumped into the category simply because the symptoms are similar, said Dr. V. Ravi, of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. He has been studying encephalitis for 30 years and is currently researching the problem with a grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the past three years, he has tested nearly 7,000 encephalitis patients in three Indian states and found that Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, both spread by mosquitoes, along with scrub typhus, a bacterial infection spread by mites, account for about 40 percent of identifiable encephalitis causes. The rest remain a question.\n\nDengue fever has no specific treatment other than supportive care, and India has not approved a newly released vaccine. Scrub typhus can be treated effectively with a cheap antibiotic if caught early.\n\nJapanese encephalitis has been wiped out in many Asian countries, but has plagued parts of India for decades, especially near the Nepal border in the northeast corner around Gorakhpur. It is closely related to West Nile virus and attacks the brain and spinal cord. It typically spreads from pigs to people via mosquitoes, is easily identified through testing and can be prevented by vaccination. It infects many people in childhood, but only a small percentage end up experiencing severe symptoms.

(AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh, File)\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a catch-all term to describe patients suffering fever, vomiting, headaches and brain function issues such as confusion, trouble speaking and coma along with seizures. The condition can leave surviving children paralyzed and mentally impaired.\n\nOutbreaks can be timed every year to the monsoon rains that leave swaths of coffee-colored flood waters standing in fields and licking at roadways in impoverished parts of the country's major rice-growing region. Yet much about the disease remains a mystery or a matter of debate.\n\n\"If there is more rain, the cases are more,\" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, the Gorakhpur hospital's former head who retired two years ago after working more than three decades as a pediatrician there. \"If there is less rain, the cases are less.\"\n\nThough it's not proven, Kushwaha suspects germs spread through fecal matter in dirty water may be related to the outbreaks, along with overall poor sanitation and improper toilet facilities and practices in the country's most populous state. But he insists the root cause is empty government promises and neglect in an area where health infrastructure and funding are poor and medical understaffing is high.\n\n\"We are just treating the fire, but we are not doing anything to prevent the fire and extinguish the fire,\" he said. \"In India, the corruption is so rampant that it has become a normal routine.\"\n\nA lack of testing capabilities makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the cause of many encephalitis cases. Often, children with other identifiable diseases get lumped into the category simply because the symptoms are similar, said Dr. V. Ravi, of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. He has been studying encephalitis for 30 years and is currently researching the problem with a grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the past three years, he has tested nearly 7,000 encephalitis patients in three Indian states and found that Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, both spread by mosquitoes, along with scrub typhus, a bacterial infection spread by mites, account for about 40 percent of identifiable encephalitis causes. The rest remain a question.\n\nDengue fever has no specific treatment other than supportive care, and India has not approved a newly released vaccine. Scrub typhus can be treated effectively with a cheap antibiotic if caught early.\n\nJapanese encephalitis has been wiped out in many Asian countries, but has plagued parts of India for decades, especially near the Nepal border in the northeast corner around Gorakhpur. It is closely related to West Nile virus and attacks the brain and spinal cord. It typically spreads from pigs to people via mosquitoes, is easily identified through testing and can be prevented by vaccination. It infects many people in childhood, but only a small percentage end up experiencing severe symptoms. Up to a third of those who are sickened develop problems ranging from paralysis to mental disabilities.\n\nIn 2005, thousands of children were rushed to the BRD Medical College with Japanese encephalitis, the same hospital at the center of the current oxygen scandal.

Answers remain unclear, but doctors who have spent decades treating sick kids in the area say the incident is a symptom of a greater problem: Chronic mismanagement, corruption and outright negligence are worsening encephalitis outbreaks that sicken thousands of children every year.\n\nThirty-three children died Aug. 10 and 11 at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, around the time there was a disruption in the oxygen supply. A team of experts sent from New Delhi concluded that the interruption was not responsible for the deaths, but that has failed to quell national fury in India over how the hospital allowed oxygen to run out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even expressed sympathy to the children's families this week during his Independence Day speech.\n\nDoctors say they hope the national spotlight will force officials to focus on another hugely neglected problem: encephalitis, which has killed more than 4,000 children and sickened nearly 25,000 since 2010 in Uttar Pradesh, where the hospital is located. Some of the children who died had the brain-swelling condition.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a catch-all term to describe patients suffering fever, vomiting, headaches and brain function issues such as confusion, trouble speaking and coma along with seizures. The condition can leave surviving children paralyzed and mentally impaired.\n\nOutbreaks can be timed every year to the monsoon rains that leave swaths of coffee-colored flood waters standing in fields and licking at roadways in impoverished parts of the country's major rice-growing region. Yet much about the disease remains a mystery or a matter of debate.\n\n\"If there is more rain, the cases are more,\" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, the Gorakhpur hospital's former head who retired two years ago after working more than three decades as a pediatrician there. \"If there is less rain, the cases are less.\"\n\nThough it's not proven, Kushwaha suspects germs spread through fecal matter in dirty water may be related to the outbreaks, along with overall poor sanitation and improper toilet facilities and practices in the country's most populous state. But he insists the root cause is empty government promises and neglect in an area where health infrastructure and funding are poor and medical understaffing is high.\n\n\"We are just treating the fire, but we are not doing anything to prevent the fire and extinguish the fire,\" he said. \"In India, the corruption is so rampant that it has become a normal routine.\"\n\nA lack of testing capabilities makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the cause of many encephalitis cases. Often, children with other identifiable diseases get lumped into the category simply because the symptoms are similar, said Dr. V. Ravi, of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. He has been studying encephalitis for 30 years and is currently researching the problem with a grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the past three years, he has tested nearly 7,000 encephalitis patients in three Indian states and found that Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, both spread by mosquitoes, along with scrub typhus, a bacterial infection spread by mites, account for about 40 percent of identifiable encephalitis causes. The rest remain a question.\n\nDengue fever has no specific treatment other than supportive care, and India has not approved a newly released vaccine. Scrub typhus can be treated effectively with a cheap antibiotic if caught early.\n\nJapanese encephalitis has been wiped out in many Asian countries, but has plagued parts of India for decades, especially near the Nepal border in the northeast corner around Gorakhpur. It is closely related to West Nile virus and attacks the brain and spinal cord. It typically spreads from pigs to people via mosquitoes, is easily identified through testing and can be prevented by vaccination. It infects many people in childhood, but only a small percentage end up experiencing severe symptoms. Up to a third of those who are sickened develop problems ranging from paralysis to mental disabilities.\n\nIn 2005, thousands of children were rushed to the BRD Medical College with Japanese encephalitis, the same hospital at the center of the current oxygen scandal. Small sweaty bodies, some convulsing, others lying unconscious with their eyes rolled back in their heads, were packed two-to-a-bed in the large, open-air ward.

Answers remain unclear, but doctors who have spent decades treating sick kids in the area say the incident is a symptom of a greater problem: Chronic mismanagement, corruption and outright negligence are worsening encephalitis outbreaks that sicken thousands of children every year.\n\nThirty-three children died Aug. 10 and 11 at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, around the time there was a disruption in the oxygen supply. A team of experts sent from New Delhi concluded that the interruption was not responsible for the deaths, but that has failed to quell national fury in India over how the hospital allowed oxygen to run out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even expressed sympathy to the children's families this week during his Independence Day speech.\n\nDoctors say they hope the national spotlight will force officials to focus on another hugely neglected problem: encephalitis, which has killed more than 4,000 children and sickened nearly 25,000 since 2010 in Uttar Pradesh, where the hospital is located. Some of the children who died had the brain-swelling condition.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a catch-all term to describe patients suffering fever, vomiting, headaches and brain function issues such as confusion, trouble speaking and coma along with seizures. The condition can leave surviving children paralyzed and mentally impaired.\n\nOutbreaks can be timed every year to the monsoon rains that leave swaths of coffee-colored flood waters standing in fields and licking at roadways in impoverished parts of the country's major rice-growing region. Yet much about the disease remains a mystery or a matter of debate.\n\n\"If there is more rain, the cases are more,\" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, the Gorakhpur hospital's former head who retired two years ago after working more than three decades as a pediatrician there. \"If there is less rain, the cases are less.\"\n\nThough it's not proven, Kushwaha suspects germs spread through fecal matter in dirty water may be related to the outbreaks, along with overall poor sanitation and improper toilet facilities and practices in the country's most populous state. But he insists the root cause is empty government promises and neglect in an area where health infrastructure and funding are poor and medical understaffing is high.\n\n\"We are just treating the fire, but we are not doing anything to prevent the fire and extinguish the fire,\" he said. \"In India, the corruption is so rampant that it has become a normal routine.\"\n\nA lack of testing capabilities makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the cause of many encephalitis cases. Often, children with other identifiable diseases get lumped into the category simply because the symptoms are similar, said Dr. V. Ravi, of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. He has been studying encephalitis for 30 years and is currently researching the problem with a grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the past three years, he has tested nearly 7,000 encephalitis patients in three Indian states and found that Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, both spread by mosquitoes, along with scrub typhus, a bacterial infection spread by mites, account for about 40 percent of identifiable encephalitis causes. The rest remain a question.\n\nDengue fever has no specific treatment other than supportive care, and India has not approved a newly released vaccine. Scrub typhus can be treated effectively with a cheap antibiotic if caught early.\n\nJapanese encephalitis has been wiped out in many Asian countries, but has plagued parts of India for decades, especially near the Nepal border in the northeast corner around Gorakhpur. It is closely related to West Nile virus and attacks the brain and spinal cord. It typically spreads from pigs to people via mosquitoes, is easily identified through testing and can be prevented by vaccination. It infects many people in childhood, but only a small percentage end up experiencing severe symptoms. Up to a third of those who are sickened develop problems ranging from paralysis to mental disabilities.\n\nIn 2005, thousands of children were rushed to the BRD Medical College with Japanese encephalitis, the same hospital at the center of the current oxygen scandal. Small sweaty bodies, some convulsing, others lying unconscious with their eyes rolled back in their heads, were packed two-to-a-bed in the large, open-air ward. Death was announced over and over again by the wailing howl of mothers collapsing on the filthy floor.\n\nIt was the largest outbreak in recent memory, ultimately killing more than 1,000 children around Gorakhpur. All those deaths could have been prevented with a cheap vaccine that was eventually rolled out in mass campaigns and is now part of the routine schedule. Coverage rates remain low in some areas, but the number of Japanese encephalitis deaths in Uttar Pradesh has fallen to double digits in recent years.\n\nHowever, overall rates of the broader acute encephalitis syndrome have not changed. More than 3,000 cases are logged each year in the state that's home to some 200 million people.\n\nThe monsoon rains have just started, and already more than 1,200 cases have been recorded along with 152 deaths. That number will climb until peaking in October.\n\n\"Hopefully, the government after this will wake up now and will start listening to us,\" said Dr. Ravi, the researcher, referring to the hospital oxygen shortage. \"Hopefully, something will happen.\"", "id": "9879422", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Amid India oxygen scandal, docs want focus on encephalitis", "image":

The nation is still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. People are displeased and social media platforms are flooded with posts against the hospital and the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nProclaiming 'those found guilty won't be spared', Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath suspended the principal of the BRD Medical College, Dr Rajiv Mishra, and sacked Dr Kafeel Khan, the Nodal Officer of BRD Medical College's Department of Pediatrics.\n\nGovernment records till September last year said 224 kids died at BRD Medical College hospital in 2016. This is out of 920 encephalitis patients admitted there. In 2017, 114 encephalitis deaths have been reported till now. A report by the Directorate of National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) said 26,686 cases of encephalitis were reported in Uttar Pradesh between 2010 and August 2017.\n\nWHAT IS ENCEPHALITIS?\n\nEncephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis (JE), is a vector-borne viral infection that leads to acute inflammation (swelling) of the brain. If not spread through vectors, encephalitis could be a result of body's immune system attacking brain tissues.\n\nInitial symptoms of encephalitis are fever and headache. Patients may suffer from fits (seizures), drowsiness, loss of consciousness and may even slip into a coma. Encephalitis, if not treated properly, could prove fatal.\n\nIf the patient's brain of spinal cord is infected, it is called primary encephalitis and infection that starts from others parts of the body and spread to the brain is called secondary encephalitis.\n\nWHAT CAUSES ENCEPHALITIS?\n\nEncephalitis could be a result of a direct brain infection -- by a virus, bacterium, or fungus -- or it could be a result of the body's immune system responding to an infection, attacking brain tissues by mistake.\n\nThere are primarily three categories of encephalitis:\n\n- Common viruses, which includes HSV (herpes simplex virus) and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)\n\n- Childhood viruses, which includes measles and mumps\n\n- Arboviruses, spread by mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects, which includes Japanese encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis\n\n- Secondary (post-infectious) encephalitis, which could be caused by a complication of a viral infection.\n\n- Despite much research, in more than 50 per cent of cases, the exact cause of encephalitis is not tracked down.\n\n- Encephalitis is also more likely to affect children, older people, people with weak immune systems, and those living in mosquito and tick affected areas.", "id": "9428489", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Encephalitis: All you need to know about the disease that

All we know is that he had a fever.\"\n\nAlok was among the children admitted to Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College, where 60 children died in a span of five days starting August 7.\n\nJust outside his home, children play in the rainwater that has collected. When asked if they know how encephalitis spreads, neighbours say they did not. \"Children are children, they will play,\" says one neighbour.\n\nIn Bichhiya in Gorakhpur, the home of a family that lost a five-year-old child to encephalitis on August 11 is surrounded by filth -- dirty drains, faeces of goats, and chicken and trash. The grandfather of the child, Ilahi, says the family tries to keep the house clean, but the condition of the neighbourhood has always been bad. \"The administration should have made roads and drains.

After three days of high fever that medicines prescribed by local doctors could not control, he says he brought his son to Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, where the child is in the ICU. He says has not heard of encephalitis, or mastikshk jwar, or of the news on the medical college.\n\nDr. K.K. Aggarwal, the president of the Indian Medical Association, said that most cases of encephalitis can be controlled with better sanitation and medicine.\n\n\"About 10% of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) cases are Japanese encephalitis, which is spread by mosquitoes. This is preventable as culex mosquitoes breed in dirty water,\" he said.\n\nHe added that scrub typhus, another cause of AES that is linked to lice, mites and fleas on the ground, can be \"100 % managed\" with antibiotics if caught in time. Another type of AES, caused by enterovirus, is linked to lack of sanitation, which can also be addressed.", "id": "9741065", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Myriad factors plague communities", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article19511584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH-18-GORAKHPUR-MAIN", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1066, "date": "2017-08-07", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1074}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1390, "date": "2017-08-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1399}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gorakhpur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "54342", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorakhpur", "label": {"eng": "Gorakhpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "55084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Komary"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "142091", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "label": {"eng": "Komary"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical drug"}, "id": "303456", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"}, {"label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "id": "303765", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "id": "303806", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicken"}, "id": "304837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"}, {"label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "id": "305821", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feces"}, "id": "306077", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fever"}, "id": "307136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"}, {"label": {"eng": "Encephalitis"}, "id": "307140", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}, "id": "312271", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Acute (medicine)"}, "id": "333401", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culex"}, "id": "336007", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex"}, {"label": {"eng": "Advanced Encryption Standard"}, "id": "352627", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Japanese encephalitis"}, "id": "360171", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_encephalitis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh cricket team"}, "id": "1082716", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh_cricket_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baba Raghav Das Medical College"}, "id": "1438776", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Raghav_Das_Medical_College"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 12, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 625, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 801, "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1014, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1101, "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1241, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders"}], "time": "17:10:00"}

Answers remain unclear, but doctors who have spent decades treating sick kids in the area say the incident is a symptom of a greater problem: Chronic mismanagement, corruption and outright negligence are worsening encephalitis outbreaks that sicken thousands of children every year.\n\nThirty-three children died Aug. 10 and 11 at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, around the time there was a disruption in the oxygen supply. A team of experts sent from New Delhi concluded that the interruption was not responsible for the deaths, but that has failed to quell national fury in India over how the hospital allowed oxygen to run out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even expressed sympathy to the children's families this week during his Independence Day speech.\n\nDoctors say they hope the national spotlight will force officials to focus on another hugely neglected problem: encephalitis, which has killed more than 4,000 children and sickened nearly 25,000 since 2010 in Uttar Pradesh, where the hospital is located. Some of the children who died had the brain-swelling condition.\n\nAcute encephalitis syndrome is a catch-all term to describe patients suffering fever, vomiting, headaches and brain function issues such as confusion, trouble speaking and coma along with seizures. The condition can leave surviving children paralyzed and mentally impaired.\n\nOutbreaks can be timed every year to the monsoon rains that leave swaths of coffee-colored flood waters standing in fields and licking at roadways in impoverished parts of the country's major rice-growing region. Yet much about the disease remains a mystery or a matter of debate.\n\n\"If there is more rain, the cases are more,\" said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, the Gorakhpur hospital's former head who retired two years ago after working more than three decades as a pediatrician there. \"If there is less rain, the cases are less.\"\n\nThough it's not proven, Kushwaha suspects germs spread through fecal matter in dirty water may be related to the outbreaks, along with overall poor sanitation and improper toilet facilities and practices in the country's most populous state. But he insists the root cause is empty government promises and neglect in an area where health infrastructure and funding are poor and medical understaffing is high.\n\n\"We are just treating the fire, but we are not doing anything to prevent the fire and extinguish the fire,\" he said. \"In India, the corruption is so rampant that it has become a normal routine.\"\n\nA lack of testing capabilities makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the cause of many encephalitis cases. Often, children with other identifiable diseases get lumped into the category simply because the symptoms are similar, said Dr. V. Ravi, of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. He has been studying encephalitis for 30 years and is currently researching the problem with a grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the past three years, he has tested nearly 7,000 encephalitis patients in three Indian states and found that Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, both spread by mosquitoes, along with scrub typhus, a bacterial infection spread by mites, account for about 40 percent of identifiable encephalitis causes. The rest remain a question.\n\nDengue fever has no specific treatment other than supportive care, and India has not approved a newly released vaccine. Scrub typhus can be treated effectively with a cheap antibiotic if caught early.\n\nJapanese encephalitis has been wiped out in many Asian countries, but has plagued parts of India for decades, especially near the Nepal border in the northeast corner around Gorakhpur. It is closely related to West Nile virus and attacks the brain and spinal cord. It typically spreads from pigs to people via mosquitoes, is easily identified through testing and can be prevented by vaccination. It infects many people in childhood, but only a small percentage end up experiencing severe symptoms. Up to a third of those who are sickened develop problems ranging from paralysis to mental disabilities.\n\nIn 2005, thousands of children were rushed to the BRD Medical College with Japanese encephalitis, the same hospital at the center of the current oxygen scandal. Small sweaty bodies, some convulsing, others lying unconscious with their eyes rolled back in their heads, were packed two-to-a-bed in the large, open-air ward. Death was announced over and over again by the wailing howl of mothers collapsing on the filthy floor.\n\nIt was the largest outbreak in recent memory, ultimately killing more than 1,000 children around Gorakhpur. All those deaths could have been prevented with a cheap vaccine that was eventually rolled out in mass campaigns and is now part of the routine schedule. Coverage rates remain low in some areas, but the number of Japanese encephalitis deaths in Uttar Pradesh has fallen to double digits in recent years.\n\nHowever, overall rates of the broader acute encephalitis syndrome have not changed. More than 3,000 cases are logged each year in the state that's home to some 200 million people.\n\nThe monsoon rains have just started, and already more than 1,200 cases have been recorded along with 152 deaths. That number will climb until peaking in October.\n\n\"Hopefully, the government after this will wake up now and will start listening to us,\" said Dr. Ravi, the researcher, referring to the hospital oxygen shortage. \"Hopefully, something will happen.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow, India, and Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report.", "id":

On August 13, at 8 am, there were six patients occupying beds. Hospital staff slept on the empty ones. Ram Prakash, the supervising doctor, said the ICU had only one ventilator and that too wasn't functioning. \"All critical encephalitis patients,\" Dr Prakash said, \"are being referred to the BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur.\"\n\nThe hospital has been in the headlines because of the death of over 70 children under its watch since August 7. The Uttar Pradesh government, reeling from the criticism in the media, has suspended a college principal and sacked the head of the hospital's paediatric department. Further down the highway, in Sahjanwa, in Gorakhpur district, a community health centre (CHC) was equipped, in 2015, with a six-bed encephalitis treatment centre. At 11 am on August 13, there were no patients at the centre. The bedsheets here are saffron, in case you were in any doubt which party is in government. In the last week, there is no record of anybody with encephalitis being admitted to the CHC. In Gorakhpur, though, the 100-bed ICU of the BRD Medical College hospital is teeming with patients suffering from encephalitis.\n\nMany of the beds are being used for more than one patient. The hospital is the only tertiary care public hospital in the area and caters to 400,000 outpatients and some 40,000 inpatients every year. Hundreds of children die at the hospital every year, many of encephalitis. Overcrowding and poor or badly maintained facilities are to blame. Indeed, many children have died in the last week or so because the hospital failed to pay a supplier, leading to a lack of oxygen in the ICU. The hospital denies the reports. While much of the information emerging from the hospital and state government is confusing, it could be that encephalitis alone is not the reason so many children are dying. The hospital's own figures suggest that only 20 per cent of the 30 children who died in just 24 hours, between August 10 and 11, had encephalitis. Its figures also show that till July, 931 out of the 2,386 newborns admitted this year to the neonatal ICU died.\n\nYogi Adityanath, the UP chief minister, has tasked a committee, chaired by the state's chief secretary Rajiv Kumar, with investigating the deaths. A preliminary inquiry has established that the hospital's creaking infrastructure and appalling management is at least partly responsible. Requesting anonymity, one committee member says the doctors in the ICU are posted by the college while support staff like nurses and pharmacists are appointed by the health department, leading to a lack of coordination. Ashutosh Tandon, the state's minister of technical and medical education, has \"sought a report\" from his ministry on the appalling shortage of facilities at the hospital.\n\nAccording to one official, only 60 per cent of the posts in the paediatrics department are filled. An ICU doctor says they \"worked with half the necessary manpower while treating twice as many patients as the hospital is equipped to treat\". But there is almost nowhere else for patients to go. Just 11 of the 68 primary health centres (PHC) in the district function round the clock, providing services for nearly 4.5 million people. In Gorakhpur district, there is only one special care newborn unit (SCNU) to treat sick babies. Dr RN Singh, a well-regarded child specialist and healthcare activist, says \"more than 40 per cent of encephalitis patients referred to the BRD Medical College can be treated and cured at PHCs and secondary clinics but are routinely sent to the bigger hospital\".\n\nIn 2012, the central government planned SCNUs in 12 eastern districts. One of these units generally contains between 12 and 20 beds and is staffed by four doctors and about 12 nurses and costs Rs 40 lakh to set up. Only three of these proposed 12 SCNUs have been built and only one is currently operational. Dr ML.Verma, a medical officer posted in Basti, said the \"health department lacks the necessary numbers of paediatricians to run the planned SCNUs\". UP health minister Siddharth Nath Singh says the government is \"planning to recruit 5,000 new doctors\" and that \"soon no unit or hospital will not be functional because of the unavailability of doctors\".

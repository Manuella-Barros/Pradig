For the last six years the Games have been held in Madison, Wisconsin, as well as California, but this year the four-day competition moves to Fort Worth in Texas.\n\nLast year Hungarian athlete Laura Horvath finally won her first title as the Fittest Woman on Earth, while Canadian athlete, Jeffrey Adler, also became the Fittest Man on Earth for the first time too. But, will they both keep their titles this year?\n\nAll eyes will no doubt be on Six-time winner Tia-Clair Toomey-Orr who's making her return to the Games and is keen to reclaim her place on the podium, after skipping last year to give birth and care for her daughter. While, on the men's side, 20% of those competing this year have already stood on the podium during their CrossFit careers. We think Roman Khrennikov will be hungry to claim top spot after placing second in 2022 and third last year, despite enduring a foot injury.\n\nWho knows, who will win, you'll have to watch to find out. Here's how...\n\nThe CrossFit Games 2024 will be taking place from 8-11 August, here's how you can watch it at home.\n\nOn TV\n\nUS CrossFit fans will be able to watch all four days of the Games live on ESPN, ESPN+, ESPN2.

The CrossFit Games will also be live-streamed on the Crossfit Games website, YouTube and Facebook. However, CrossFit Games states that: \"A replay of the two-hour exclusive ESPN+ primetime content on YouTube 12 hours after the original content\".\n\nBelow are the events that we know will be taking place so far over the four days.

But Port Orchard's Sierra Landholm refuses to let that keep her from going for her dream.\n\nLandholm qualified as one of 10 competitors in the 2024 Adaptive CrossFit Games by WheelWOD. She will be competing in the Lower Impairment Below Knee Division Sept. 19-22 in San Antonio, TX.\n\n\"My goal going into the Open was to make the semifinals and then the goal in the semis was to reach the finals,\" Landholm said. \"It was a lot of waiting but once the leaderboard was finalized, I felt really proud of myself because I know a lot of people don't get this opportunity.\"\n\nLandholm was born with Congenital right hip disarticulation. Her hip joint was unstable at birth and so she is without her right leg.\n\nLandholm began doing CrossFit as a hobby with her husband in March 2023. She never expected to make it this far in her first year as a competitor.\n\nMy husband and I \"talked about it for months before we decided to sign up for a class,\" Landholm said. \"I wasn't originally planning on competing at all. They had an adaptive division for a few years but the lower impairment division were people with one leg competing with people with two legs who were impacted somehow. It wasn't a fair playing field in my mind.\"\n\nEven though Landholm is new to CrossFit, she has been an athlete her entire life. She grew up with five siblings who played sports, and she competed right along with them. Landholm played soccer from kindergarten to second grade and basketball in the local recreational league through elementary school. However, her disability began to hold her back in middle school when she tried out for the school basketball team.\n\n\"The coach told me he appreciated my effort and that I worked really hard but I didn't think I was ready for the team because I wasn't fast enough,\" Landholm said. \"That made me realize I didn't want to play basketball anymore so I began swimming.\"\n\nLandholm became a competitive swimmer in middle school. She swam for about a decade, competing at Ripon College in Wisconsin. She ended up finishing 19th in the 1650 freestyle in the Midwest Conference Championships with a time of 23 minutes, 54.80 seconds.\n\nLandholm followed that up by winning the 1500-meter freestyle in the 2012 Paralympic Trials. Afterward, she retired from swimming and became a paralegal for the state Attorney's Office. But she wanted to remain active despite working up to 45 hours a week.\n\n\"I worked out at a gym before COVID hit at VIE Athletics,\" Landholm said. \"This started my lifting journey where it was an all women's gym with functional strength training with high- intensity exercises.\"\n\nShortly after, Landhom made the cross to CrossFit. She struggled at first because she was the only one with a disability. She had to battle her mindset to push further. \"With everything going on in life, it's hard to get out of my head and do my best,\" Landholm said. \"All we can do is wake up, live and keep going, and with the support of the gym, my husband and family, it is doable.\"\n\nLandholm's first competition was the CrossFit Open Feb. 29-March 18. She placed sixth and qualified for the semifinals May 8-13. She finished seventh to qualify for the 2024 Adaptive CrossFit Games.\n\nEach competition has different events, depending on their abilities. Landholm has competed in cardio, burpees, deadlifts, squats and more. She does not know her events for the finals yet but is ready to make a name for herself as one of two Washington competitors. \"My goal was to get there, and now it's just to see what I can do,\" Landholm said. \"I am training harder but going with the flow at this point because I don't know what to expect.\"\n\nSince several CrossFit athletes are sponsored, they do not have to worry about the costs of traveling to San Antonio. However, Landholm has created a GoFundMe to raise $4,000. \"I am not expecting anything because if I cover it myself, I'll just work harder,\" Landholm said. \"There is something special about a community rallying behind someone trying to do something important to them.\"\n\nIf she does not raise all the money, she will still head to San Antonio with hopes of making new CrossFit friends. \"CrossFit is really about the community, and I am excited to get to know about different parts of the community,\" Landholm said. \"It's important to show disabled people can still be very fit and compete at the top level.\"", "source": {"uri": "kitsapdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kitsap Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripon_College_(Wisconsin)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ripon College (Wisconsin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwest Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpee_(exercise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burpee (exercise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadlift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squat (exercise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strength training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.kitsapdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/36628981_web1_240621-poi-crossfit-landholm_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799397", "eventUri": "eng-9799397", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-29", "dateEnd": "-03-18", "textStart": 3149, "textEnd": 3165}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-19", "dateEnd": "2024-09-22", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 360}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-08", "dateEnd": "-05-13", "textStart": 3217, "textEnd": 3225}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 CrossFit Games are back, debuting in Forth Worth, Texas, from August 8th to 11th.\n\nBoth the men's and women's divisions were turned on their heads at the last year's games. Laura Horvath (Hungary) became the first woman not named Tia-Clair Toomey to win since 2017. Jeffrey Adler (Canada) became only the third individual to win since 2016.\n\nThis year, perennial contenders Roman Khrennikov, Justin Medeiros, and Pat Vellner will all look to upend the Fittest Man on Earth crown from Adler's head. For the women, all eyes are on Tia-Clair Toomey -- the winningest Games athlete, who is returning to competition after taking last year off to give birth and care for her first child. Other contenders include 19-year-old Emma Lawson, Gabriela Miga\u0142a, and Arielle Loewen.\n\nNotably, CrossFit isn't hosting the Adaptive and Age Group divisions at the games this year. The Adaptive athletes will compete at the WheelWOD Adaptive CrossFit Games in San Antonio, September 19th through the 22nd. Teens will compete at the Pit Teen Throwdown in Three Rivers, Michigan, from August 27th through the 30th. Master athletes will compete at the Legends Championship in Tempe, Arizona, December 12th through the 13th.\n\nThe games will still host a Team competition. In total, 30 teams, consisting of two men and two women, will compete on the same days as the individual competitors.\n\nIf you can't make it to Texas, you can watch the CrossFit Games free online. You can live stream the events on the CrossFit Games website, Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube, or download the CrossFit Games app. The events will also be broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN+.\n\nA detailed event schedule isn't available at the time of publication.

The Games draw the world's top 40 women and is considered to be the sport's championship.\n\nSIGN UP: Your free all-access pass to the best high school sports coverage in San Antonio\n\nDomit's quick rise in CrossFit is considered unusual, her coach Matt Bryant said.\n\n\"There are people who do CrossFit for 10 years before they make it to the Games,\" said Bryant, owner of Golden Line Training. \"She's just a talented human being with a lot of athleticism and skill adaptation and a mindset that is she's just so driven once she goes all-in on something.\"\n\nThose are the necessary traits to be successful in CrossFit, in which competitors participate in events that test speed, strength and endurance in a variety of ways like distance swims, obstacle courses, rope climbs and object carries.\n\nCompetitors have to be ready for anything as they may not know exactly what they are doing until about 20 minutes before each event. It's that competitive side of CrossFit that helped erase preconceived notions Domit had about the sport.\n\n\"I didn't understand the competitive side of it or the sports side of it,\" said Domit, a 2015 Brandeis graduate who earned a degree in psychology from UTSA in 2019. \"I thought it was just like a class you do and work out. My perception was that I never understood people who paid to work out. That didn't make sense to me. I worked out every day, what would I pay to do that?\"\n\nThe membership was a gift from her future husband, Antun. Actually, as Domit put it, \"he signed me up behind my back.\"\n\n\"You've got to do this,\" Antun told her. \"You've got to do this. You would love it. You would be good at it.\"\n\nThat got her into the gym.\n\n\"It changed my life with the community and the people I'm around,\" said Domit, who married Antun in December 2021. \"Just so much growth has happened for me since then.\"\n\nIt was an unforeseen blessing that changed the trajectory of her life.\n\nPrior to getting into CrossFit, Domit was a model for three years. Domit didn't get into specifics, but she said that world was sending her down a bad path.\n\n\"There was so much of a toxic environment with the people I was around,\" Domit said. \"There's a lot of blurred lines in that industry, and you can just get into the wrong crowd and stuff like that ... I needed a big change and now things are just so different. I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. Things are just so great. I feel much more fulfilled.\"\n\nDomit's modeling career halted during the pandemic in 2020. That paved the way for a transition into CrossFit.\n\nShe's never looked back.\n\nDomit laughs when she recalls her first competition, when she teamed with Antun in September 2020 at the Duality event in San Antonio.\n\n\"We had no idea what we were doing,\" Domit said.\n\nWhile it was a disaster on the results sheet - they finished last - it ignited a determination to get better. Domit returned to the same competition a year later and won the event as an individual.\n\n\"It definitely sparked my interest,\" Domit said. \"I thought, 'Wow. I want to do that again. I want to feel that again.' It was so much fun. It fired me up. I wanted to come back and beat everybody.\"\n\nThat was the first in a string of wins at local events and started her path to national and world competitions.\n\nDomit finished 26th at last year's Games held in Madison, Wis. She qualified for it by finishing eighth at the North American West Semifinals in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nShe enters the 2024 Games as the North American West Semifinals champion, a competition she won in June in Carson, Calif.\n\n\"Abbie has been growing, and she continues to grow as an athlete in the sport,\" Bryant said. \"She's getting more confidence under her belt with more competitions and higher placings each time she's going in.

who has participated in the CrossFit Games for several years earning him a ranking of 88th worldwide in men's category - had shared a snap to his Instagram story showing him grinning as he prepared to take part just yesterday.\n\nOrganisers of the competition have since shared a statement on social media confirming that a competitor had passed away, although \u0110uki\u0107 was not named.\n\nIt read: \"CrossFit is deeply saddened by the death of a CrossFit Games competitor during the swimming portion of Individual Event 1 at the 2024 CrossFit Games.\n\n\"We are fully cooperating with authorities and doing everything we can to support the family at this time.\n\n\"The remainder of today's events have been suspended.\n\n\"The well-being of competitors is our first priority and we are heartbroken by this tragic event.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top 40"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mile run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CrossFit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Blind", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Blind", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt0cb80e5bb237485e/66b4ff3aecd26baf14887b38/crossfit-games-fort-worth-us-death-athlete.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799397", "eventUri": "eng-9799397", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 277, "textEnd": 285}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

This is not something that has been achieved in one day. Pan, like every other Chinese athletes, has taken dozens of doping tests.\"\n\nZhang challenged the double standards in the scrutiny faced by Chinese athletes compared to their Western counterparts.\n\n\"Maybe you should ask him or his coach why he can swim so fast,\" she said of Pan. \"But why should Chinese athletes be questioned about it? What if the world record is broken by an athlete from other country? Has anyone questioned Michael Phelps when he won so many medals? Why does the western media not question Katie Ledecky when she dominated? It's ridiculous.\"\n\nZhang said that Chinese swimmers had \"nothing to hide\" and strongly defended the actions and integrity of the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA).\n\n\"I don't think it has influenced me or any other Chinese swimmer,\" said Zhang, reflecting on the impact of the allegations on her performance and morale.\n\nZhang emphasized the transparency and diligence of global authorities such as swimming governing body World Aquatics and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\n\n\"We're innocent. World Aquatics and WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency] have made very clear statements about the whole thing. Some people just don't want to believe it. There's nothing we can do to change those people's mind.\"\n\nHighlighting the rigorous testing regime that athletes undergo, Zhang acknowledged the inconvenience but stressed the importance of compliance.\n\n\"It's our responsibility to do the doping tests,\" said the 26-year-old, who has won two gold and two silver in Tokyo before claiming three bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's not only for Chinese swimmers. The frequency of the doping tests, for both Chinese swimmers and swimmers from other countries, has been increasing. It's every athlete's obligation to do it. In terms of the impact, I think anyone who is waken up to take the test around 5 a.m. might feel a little bit annoyed.\"\n\nZhang also addressed the broader impact of the doping allegations on China's Olympic ambitions. \"We won't change our goal for the Olympics. The goal was established before the Games and we won't change it because we don't need to.\"\n\nShe reiterated her faith in the fairness of World Aquatics and WADA, condemning the leaks that have marred athletes' reputations.\n\n\"I believe World Aquatics and WADA have made fair decisions and they won't cover up anything for anyone who made mistakes. World Aquatics has made the investigation and respected the privacy of the athletes. They don't want the athletes to be influenced and compete in the Olympics in an unfair way. But the athletes' information has been leaked out by western media.\"\n\nZhang expressed sadness at the unfair portrayal of her image in the media after some Western media outlets accused authorities of covering up contamination cases involving 23 Chinese swimmers.\n\n\"Some websites used my picture to represent the 23 athletes. That's not right and has caused me troubles. It's not my problem or my fault so why should I bear the consequence? As an athlete still competing, I'm worried that other competitors doubted me and don't want to compete with me. I'm also worried if some spectators don't want to see me competing anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "chinanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yufei_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Yufei (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.themainstreammedia.com/story_logos/newsnet/china-news.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785938", "eventUri": "eng-9785938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

To put it plainly, I'd rather die in the pool.\"\n\nShe received a groundswell of support in China for her scathing attack on Western media, as the topic 'Zhang Yufei's rebuttal to foreign journalists' gained more than 35.76 million views on Weibo, the country's largest social media platform. \"Her counterarguments are very clear. Foreign journalists have been targeting China, which reveals their hegemonic attitude. They [the Westerners] feel their strengths are being challenged, so they resort to such lowly methods to retaliate,\" one user commented.\n\nZhang was part of the relay team that captured China's first medal in the pool at the Games after winning bronze in the women's 4x100 metre relay last week alongside teammate Yang Junxuan, who was one of the multiple swimmers also caught up in the Tokyo doping scandal.\n\nShe had remained hopeful that her rivals would believe she was competing cleanly at the Games, pointing out that she had been tested between 20 and 30 times a month in the build-up to the Paris Games.\n\n\"I don't think there's a single athlete, Chinese or foreign, who would test positive for doping. They would not want to destroy all the hard work they've put in over the years on doping,\" Zhang told reporters in Chinese last Saturday after she posted the fastest qualifying time in the 100-metre

The World Anti-Doping Agency stood by its decision to clear the swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication months before the Tokyo Games began.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Wade contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doping in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Jiajun_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Jiajun (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Haiyang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qin Haiyang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeleb_Dressel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caeleb Dressel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yufei_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Yufei (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/preview-300.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785938", "eventUri": "eng-9785938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

But Zhang managed her third bronze of a Games, having already come third in the 100m butterfly and the 4x100m freestyle relay.\n\nShe was born in Xuzhou, in the country\u2019s eastern Jiangsu province, on April 19, 1998. Both her parents were swimming coaches, so by time she was three, she was already learning to swim.\n\n\u201cIt was probably both of them who threw me into the pool together,\u201d Zhang said in an interview with Chinese media.\n\nHer father was often away from home leading his club swimming team at national competitions, but when Zhang was just four, he died in an unexplained accident.\n\nAlthough her memories of her father are limited, Zhang used swimming as a way to remember him.\n\nBy the time she was five years old, Zhang had graduated to the Xuzhou City Swimming Team and was receiving regular training. Seven years later, she took part in the Jiangsu Provincial Games and competed in six events, winning two gold, three silver and one bronze.\n\nThat stand-out performance got her admitted to the Jiangsu provincial team as their youngest-ever member.\n\nEveryone around Zhang said she was destined for greatness, but at a 2012 Swimming World Cup Series meet in Beijing, she stunned the nation.\n\nZhang came second in the 400m freestyle, beating Liu Zige \u2013 who by the Paris Olympics still held the world record in the 200m butterfly. One year later, at only 15 years old, she was in the national team.\n\nIn 2014, at the Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing, the Asian Games in Incheon and the World Swimming Championships in Qatar, Zhang won two silvers and a bronze.\n\nHowever, in 2015, Zhang\u2019s life hit another unexpected turn as she was diagnosed with a minor case of scoliosis, causing the muscles on her back to develop unevenly.\n\nHer coaches developed a training plan to help her swim with an uneven spine and she began to develop in the pool and physically. After six months, she was doing pull-ups, something she had not managed before.\n\nZhang qualified for the Rio 2016 Olympics and finished sixth in the 200m butterfly. But by the time she joined the national team in Australia for a two-month training stint in January 2018, and for reasons unknown to her, she had come to hate swimming.\n\nWhen she saw the pool, she said, she would cry. Her results started to dip.\n\nAt the 2019 World Championships in South Korea, she finished way down the standings, 26th overall, in the 200m butterfly. Her time of two minutes, 14.20 seconds was about 10 seconds slower than she would prove to be capable of.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to swim, I\u2019d see the pool and just get so angry,\u201d she said.\n\nRather than taking a break, Zhang\u2019s coach changed her training. She went back to basics and just trained jumping off the block and underwater kicking.\n\nZhang said these sessions gave her time to think and reflect. Soon, her state of mind improved and she started incorporating more physical training.\n\nAnd it paid off.\n\nNot many win two Olympic golds in one day, but that is what Zhang did at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nIn the first of those two races, Zhang broke the Olympic record in the 200 metres butterfly, with 2:03.86. Less than two hours later, she was atop the podium with her teammates after they won the women\u2019s 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\nThree months before the Paris Olympics, The New York Times reported that ahead of the Tokyo Games in 2021, 23 Chinese swimmers, Zhang included, had tested positive for TMZ, a banned drug that can aid performance.\n\nIt said the swimmers, 11 of whom are competing in Paris, were cleared of wrongdoing by Chinese doping authorities, who said they ingested contaminated food, an explanation accepted by the World Anti-doping Agency (Wada). That version of events was confirmed by Wada.\n\nBut in Paris, the Chinese team have reportedly been subject to an average of seven doping tests per day.\n\n\u201cLook at the facts,\u201d Zheng has said in Paris.\n\n\u201cWorld Aquatics and the [International Testing Agency] have investigated our Chinese athletes and the whole thing many times and tested them many times before we came to the Paris Olympics.\n\n\u201cEach one of us was tested 20 to 30 times in two months, three to four times a week on average.\u201d\n\nShe voiced concern over how she was perceived.\n\n\u201cI competed very well with friends from other countries. Now I come to participate in the Olympic Games, I\u2019m very worried that my good friends look at me with different eyes \u2026 that they do not want to compete with me or watch my races. I\u2019m more worried about the French people. I think the Chinese do not deserve this.\u201d\n\nThe team have performed below expectation in Paris, with notable exceptions being Zhang and Pan Zhanle, who had been underwhelming until producing a stunning world record to win 100m freestyle gold.\n\nSome have been a shadow of their former selves, making Zhang\u2019s medal tally all the more impressive.\n\nZhang has made a plea in Paris for empathy, saying: \u201cChinese athletes or foreign athletes, they would not want to destroy all the hard work they have put in over the years by doping.\u201d\n\nAfter that, it was back to the water to do her talking there.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres",

All swimmers involved in the incident have been cleared of any wrongdoings and have gone through a rigorous doping test program, consistent with international regulations, to be allowed to compete in Paris.\n\nThe release of Chinese athletes' personal information in April, first by The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD has, however, caused unfair and unnecessary extra scrutiny of the team, leaving athletes mentally pressured during the Games.\n\n\"Since we've been proven innocent, it's unfair for us to be put into a situation where I personally have to concern opinions of some other countries' athletes being influenced toward us,\" said Zhang. \"Emotionally, I feel sad that my hard training and performances would not be respected.\"\n\nAs an athlete not involved in the 2021 contamination incident, Pan was celebrated by fans and the majority of swimming's international community when he took 0.4 seconds off his own world record on his way to victory in Wednesday's 100m freestyle final, in a new world record time of 46.40 seconds.\n\nAustralia's runner-up Kyle Chalmers and Romanian former world record holder David Popovici, who finished third, expressed their respect for the Chinese teenager's improvement, acknowledging his record-breaking performance as motivational.\n\nBut Brett Hawke, an Australian swimming coach who is not part of the current Olympic delegation, posted outrageous speculation from afar about Pan's progress, suggesting his performance was enhanced.\n\n\"I am angry at that swim,\" Hawke posted on Instagram on Wednesday. \"I'm upset right now because you don't win 100 freestyle by a body length on that field. You just don't do it. It is not humanly possible to beat that field by a body length.\"\n\nZhang spoke up for her younger teammate, reiterating that it is unreasonably biased to question an athlete who has fully cooperated with all relevant organizations and gone through repeated testing without a single negative result prior to and during the Games.\n\n\"Pan's cracked the 47-second barrier quite a few times over the past year on a steady rise in his training and competition,\" Zhang said of his improvement.\n\n\"He's been tested I don't know how many times here. If he'd violated any doping rules, as some would have speculated, WADA or World Aquatics would've already taken actions.

He had declined to speak with journalists after his preliminary swims, but a medal meant a news conference. And a news conference meant there would be questions about Chinese doping.\n\n\"I think all of these test results have proven my innocence,\" Wang said through a translator after the men's 200-meter individual medley. He had been drug-tested an average of twice a week before China's Olympic qualifying meet, he said, and 11 times in the two weeks before the Games began in Paris.\n\nAs the Olympic swimming competition draws to a close on Sunday, the sport is continuing to grapple with lingering distrust and unanswered questions after the revelation of dozens of positive drug tests among Chinese swimmers in recent years, and of Chinese claims that food contamination was to blame in three separate incidents.\n\nThose explanations have been accepted by the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which did not publicize the positives or discipline the swimmers. A dozen Chinese swimmers known to have previously tested positive for a banned substance, including Wang, competed at the Paris Olympics.\n\nWang's bronze was one of nine medals won by Chinese swimmers in France through Saturday, compared with only six at the Tokyo Games. But that total has come up short in the measure that China and many countries use to judge their Olympic performance: gold medals.\n\nIn that accounting, Chinese swimmers in Paris, who have claimed only a single gold with one night of competition left, have lagged behind both their results from Tokyo (when they won three) and their lofty expectations.\n\nSkepticism about their performances, however, remains. The International Olympic Committee has said that the Chinese swimmers have been the most tested of any team in their sport at these Games. The Chinese freestyler Yang Junxuan, who like Wang previously tested positive on two occasions, said that their results while being so frequently tested should speak for themselves.\n\nAny number of factors -- training, age, the distraction of increased testing -- could have affected the team's results, but one clear takeaway from these Olympics is that the new reality for Chinese swimmers is that they will be tested more often and that their success will continue to be scrutinized.\n\nSome of that scrutiny was directed toward Pan Zhanle, who won the men's 100 freestyle on Wednesday in world-record time -- the only world record set in an individual event in the Paris pool so far.\n\nAfter Pan finished more than a second ahead of the silver medalist, the swim coach and former Australian Olympian Brett Hawke suggested in a social media video that it was \"not humanly possible\" to win the Olympic final of a sprint event by a body length.\n\nThe 19-year-old Pan, though, is not among the swimmers known to have tested positive for a banned substance. After his race, he said that he had been tested 21 times from May through July. His teammate, Zhang Yufei, who earlier in the meet said that she was worried that competitors and fans would look at the Chinese swimmers differently, called the scrutiny on Pan unfair.\n\n\"Why do Chinese athletes need to be suspected when they swim really fast?\" Zhang said through a translator after winning the bronze in the women's 200 butterfly. \"Michael Phelps, when he won seven or eight gold medals: Why was he not suspected or challenged?\"\n\nWang and Zhang, who added four medals (but no golds) to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in Paris, were both among the 23 Chinese swimmers who The New York Times reported tested positive for the prescription heart medicine trimetazidine, or TMZ, before the Tokyo Olympics but were secretly cleared and allowed to continue competing. Zhang won four medals in Tokyo, including two golds. Wang won the 200 I.M. at those Games.\n\nWang was also one of three Chinese swimmers who had tested positive several years earlier for a different banned substance, along with Yang and the breast-stroker Qin Haiyang. Qin turned in one of China's most disappointing individual performances in France, failing to win a medal in either of the breaststroke events that he won at last year's world championships. In the 200 breaststroke, an event in which he holds the world record, Qin failed to make the final, which he attributed to putting too much pressure on himself.\n\nLast week, The Times reported on a third previously undisclosed incident in which two Chinese swimmers, including one who swam in the heats for the women's 4x200 relay team that won a bronze in France, tested positive for another banned drug in 2022.\n\nIn response, WADA acknowledged it had concerns about the number of doping cases that were being closed without discipline because it was not possible to challenge the assertion that the positive tests were the result of contamination.\n\nYu Yiting, who won a relay bronze and finished fourth in the women's 200 I.M., said in a translated interview that she was \"quite surprised\" when she found out that she tested positive for TMZ before the Tokyo Games. She said that the group of 23 swimmers, who Chinese authorities said ingested the banned substance from a tainted kitchen at a hotel where they stayed together for a meet, cooperated with the investigation, including reporting what they ate and used in the hotel.\n\nSeveral of the Chinese swimmers who previously tested positive leaned on the same defense in Paris: that they had been cleared by international organizations, including WADA and World Aquatics, swimming's governing body. Others declined to answer questions about doping, or were encouraged by members of China's state media not to respond to queries on the topic made by foreign reporters in the mixed zone at the swimming venue.\n\nIn one interaction recorded by a Times reporter, a Chinese journalist, speaking in Mandarin, suggested to the swimmer Fei Liwei that he should just answer a question about doping by saying that the Chinese team is clean.\n\n\"They are the most tested,\" Mark Adams, spokesman for the International Olympic Committee, said when asked if the Chinese swimmers were competing clean in Paris. \"Can you ever say that with any team? Never 100 percent. But all the work is being done.\"\n\nTariq Panja and Weiyi Cai contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,\" he said on Instagram. \"You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.\"\n\nOther Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100 backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200 medley behind French hero Leon Marchand.\n\nTang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100 breaststroke.\n\nBritain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100 meters medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\n\nYet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: \"To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.\"\n\nThere were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200 meters world record.\n\nQin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100 meters final and failing to even make the 200 final.\n\nIn China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media.\n\nBut fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances.\n\n\"Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions\", said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction.\n\nOfficial media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA.\n\n\"The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,\" the China Daily newspaper said. \"This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"},

Pan won the other gold by setting a world record in the 100-meter free Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S., which took silver, was 15 for 15 in the event since its debut in 1960, winning every year but 1980, when the country boycotted. France won bronze ahead of Great Britain.\n\nChina won 12 swimming medals in Paris, doubling its tally from Tokyo, though finishing with one fewer gold. But its successes were met with scrutiny -- which extended to the sport's regulations.\n\nThe background: On April 20, reporting from The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD revealed 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance seven months before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 -- and were never punished. The banned substance was trimetazidine (TMZ), a prescription heart drug that can enhance performance by increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nSome of the athletes who tested positive went on to medal in Tokyo. The swimmers were allowed to compete in the Olympics after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted China's findings that suggested the Chinese swimmers unwittingly ingested the substance from food they ate at a hotel.\n\nU.S. star Katie Ledecky and other American swimmers expressed their support for stringent anti-doping policies in the days before the Games. \"I hope everyone here (in Paris) is going to be competing clean this week,\" Ledecky said on July 24. \"But what really matters also is: Were they training clean? Hopefully, that's been the case. Hopefully, there's been even testing around the world. I think everyone's heard what the athletes think. They want transparency. They want further answers to the questions that still remain.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Great Britain swimmer Adam Peaty, part of the relay team that finished fourth, expressed further skepticism about the system.\n\n\"I think we've got our faith in the system, but we also don't,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \"Whoever's in the race, I expect in my head that it has to be fair for them to be there. We did our best job as a team to do that, and it may have been (worthy of) a bronze. Who knows?\"\n\nThe Chinese swimmers were not shielded from the questions. Pan, the two-time gold medalist, was not one of the 23 swimmers who tested positive before Tokyo. But he said he was tested 21 times from May through July, according to The New York Times.\n\n\"The test was essentially done under all the regulations, so I don't feel there was any difference or influence,\" he said after his gold in the 100-meter freestyle.\n\nPan also said he encountered tension from his peers, though any issues were reportedly smoothed out. Pan reportedly told a Chinese broadcaster Australian swimmer Kyle Chalmers snubbed him after the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay on July 27, but Chalmers, who finished second in the 100 free, told reporters no harm was intended and they've exchanged messages.\n\n\"I'm supposed to be going to the world cup series and the first leg is in Shanghai. He's looking forward to having me there and wanted to show me around, so that makes me a lot more excited about going,\" Chalmers said, according to The Guardian.\n\nZhang Yufei, one of the swimmers who tested positive for TMZ before Tokyo and won silver and five bronze medals in Paris, said at the start of the Games she hoped her competitors would believe she is competing clean.\n\n\"I don't think there's a single athlete, Chinese or foreign, who would test positive for doping,\" she said, according to the AP. \"They would not want to destroy all the hard work they've put in over the years on doping.\"\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. After The New York Times reported Tuesday two Chinese swimmers were cleared of doping in 2022 because of contaminated food, WADA said it was concerned about how many cases are being closed due to food contamination, not just in China but in several countries.\n\nWADA said it began an investigation in early 2024 into the \"circumstances, scale and risk of meat contamination with metandienone\" in China and other countries. That investigation is still ongoing, it said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_merola@nytimes.com", "name": "Lauren

I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,\" he said on Instagram.\n\n\"You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.\"\n\nOther Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100m backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200m medley behind French hero Leon Marchand.\n\nTang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100m breaststroke.\n\nBritain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100m medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\n\nYet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: \"To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.\"\n\nThere were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200m world record.\n\nQin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100m final and failing to even make the 200m final.\n\nIn China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media.\n\nBut fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances.\n\n\"Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions\", said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction.\n\nOfficial media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA.\n\n\"The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,\" the China Daily newspaper said.\n\n\"This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.\"\n\nmp/gj\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris has secured enough Democratic delegate votes to become their party's nominee, chair says\n\nCooking with Bears?

The World Anti-Doping Agency stood by its decision to clear the swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication months before the Tokyo Games began.", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doping in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanterre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yufei_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Yufei (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/ea2ff4e5-e497-459b-8a7f-d73b8f78112c/20240804T184244/ea2ff4e5-e497-459b-8a7f-d73b8f78112c_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785938", "eventUri": "eng-9785938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,\" he said on Instagram.\n\n\"You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.\"\n\nOther Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100m backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200m medley behind French hero Leon Marchand.\n\nTang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100m breaststroke.\n\nBritain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100m medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\n\nYet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: \"To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.\"\n\nThere were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200m world record.\n\nQin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100m final and failing to even make the 200m final.\n\nIn China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media.\n\nBut fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances.\n\n\"Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions\", said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction.\n\nOfficial media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA.\n\n\"The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,\" the China Daily newspaper said.\n\n\"This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.\"\n\nmp/gj", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,\" he said on Instagram.\n\n\"You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.\"\n\nOther Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100m backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200m medley behind French hero Leon Marchand.\n\nTang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100m breaststroke.\n\nBritain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100m medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\n\nYet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: \"To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.\"\n\nThere were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200m world record.\n\nQin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100m final and failing to even make the 200m final.\n\nIn China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media.\n\nBut fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances.\n\n\"Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions\", said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction.\n\nOfficial media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA.\n\n\"The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,\" the China Daily newspaper said.\n\n\"This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The swimmers were allowed to compete after a Chinese investigation ruled that they consumed food that had been contaminated.\n\n\"In sport, one of my favorite quotes I've seen lately is 'There's no point in winning if you don't win it fair,'\" British star Adam Peaty said after his foursome wound up fourth to miss the medal stand. \"I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you're cheating, you're not winning, right?

Zhang Yufei, another one of the swimmers among the 23, was on the team.\n\nPeaty said there is some anger and frustration.\n\n\"I don't want to paint a whole nation or a whole group of people with one brush, I think it's very unfair,\" Peaty said. \"But there have been two cases of it and I think it's very disappointing, and I've tried to keep out of the conversations until now for the betterment of the team but I think we're going to use that to our advantage the next four years, whether I'm there or not. I know these boys will carry that.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We'll see how they do in four years' time, but I think the people that need to do the job will wake up and do the job.\"\n\nZhang said when the Olympics began that she and her teammates tested three to four days a week in the past couple of months leading up to the Paris Games and in the wake of a doping scandal involving 23 Chinese swimmers. The World Anti-Doping Agency stood by its decision to clear the swimmers who tested positive for a banned heart medication months before the Tokyo Games began.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Wade contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doping in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Jiajun_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Jiajun (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Haiyang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qin Haiyang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeleb_Dressel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caeleb Dressel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yufei_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Yufei (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/89/3896f50f-6cdd-5905-aedf-65dfda850568/66afcc413716f.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785938", "eventUri": "eng-9785938", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

But outside China, their success has been met with scrutiny - including from some of their peers in the world of elite swimming.\n\nThe Chinese swim team has come under immense pressure following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.\n\nThe swimmers had been cleared by China's Anti-Doping Agency shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for a banned heart medication were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.\n\nThe accusations, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, have sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules.\n\nConcern only deepened last week, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for trace amounts of a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by Chinese officials - again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.\n\nIn China, many social media users saw the Chinese swim team's historic win in the relay as a resounding vindication.\n\nThe victory dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Monday, creating several top trending topics on microblogging site Weibo. The hashtag \"Pan Zhanle's stunning reversal\" racked up more than 500 million views, as did another hashtag about the relay gold medal.\n\nPan, who turned 20 on Sunday, called the team gold medal his birthday present.\n\n\"I fulfilled the promise I made a year ago by celebrating my 20th birthday with a team gold medal,\" he wrote in a viral post on Weibo, where the swimmer became an overnight celebrity with 1.6 million followers.\n\n\"A new journey has begun, and the goals have been quietly set. I hope I can make an even greater contribution to the team. The Chinese swim team is always the best!\"\n\nPan also won fans for his confidence and candidness.\n\nIn a pool-side interview with state broadcaster CCTV right after the event, some of Pan's teammates said they were not happy with their own performance in the earlier legs of the relay. Pan cheered and praised his teammates: \"The race is over, and the championship is ours. It shouldn't be us who are dissatisfied; it should be the others.\"\n\nChinese swimmer Pan Zhanle broke the world record in the men's 100m freestyle at the Paris Olympics on July 31, 2024.\n\nChristian Liewig/Corbis/Getty Images\n\n'We won fair and square'\n\nIn China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the doping allegations have brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment - especially over the scrutiny the team has faced this summer.\n\nNearly a dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive three years ago are competing in the Paris Olympics, including two of the quartet that won relay gold on Sunday.\n\nDouble gold-medalist Pan did not test positive in 2021, but he has also faced questions over his stellar performance in Paris.\n\nAfter Pan smashed the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympic swimmer and coach, posted on Instagram that \"it's not humanly possible to beat that field\" and that the swim was \"not real life. Not in that pool, against that field.\"\n\nBack in China, state media and internet users have rallied to Pan's defense. On Monday, many Chinese social media users applauded Pan for defying the pressure and proving his accusers wrong.\n\n\"If breaking the record the first time didn't convince the foreigners, this stunning reversal surely did. (Pan's) so impressive and dominant!\" said a comment with 2,300 upvotes.\n\n\"Our strength speaks for itself. We won the gold fair and square,\" said another.\n\nBut overseas, doubts linger.\n\nAfter Sunday's relay, British triple Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty called for stricter doping testing after the British team finished fourth in the race.\n\n\"I think we've got to have faith in the system, but we also don't,\" he said, according to Reuters. \"I think it's just got to be stricter.\"\n\n\"One of my favorite quotes I've seen lately is there's no point in winning if you don't win it fair,\" Peaty said. \"And I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you're cheating, you don't win it, right.\n\n\"So, for me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honorable person, you should be out of the sport.\"\n\nCNN's Joyce Jiang and Simone McCarthy contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nectar_gan@cnn.com",

All of the swimmers were cleared by the China Anti-Doping Agency (Chinada) which blamed contaminated food. China's 30-member swimming team won six medals at the Tokyo Games, including three golds. Chinada said in a statement to the New York Times that its athletes had not violated any anti-doping laws and it was not obliged to publish any details without the consent of the athlete.\n\nWhat are the suspicions?\n\nThe revelation of past positive drugs tests among China's team have cast a huge shadow over the Paris Olympics, sparking fears that China is involved in a doping cover-up. It comes after Pan Zhanle, who was not one of the 23 swimmers implicated in the Times story, shaved almost half a second off his 100m freestyle time before setting another record for the fastest anchor leg in the men's 4x100m medley on Sunday night.\n\nThe issue has triggered a diplomatic spat between the US and China, while several Chinese swimmers claim they have been met with a frosty reception by their American and Australian competitors.\n\nWhat is trimetazidine?\n\nTMZ is found in heart medication and helps to metabolise fatty acids, which in turn helps the body to use oxygen. The drug allows for more blood flow to your heart and limits quick changes in blood pressure. Although it was developed for medical use in the 1970s, it only became a banned drug on Wada's list of prohibited substances in 2014.\n\nHow did Wada respond?\n\nIn light of the Times report, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) confirmed that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for TMZ before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but accepted the country's findings that this was because of substance contamination.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Wada slammed the \"misleading and potentially defamatory media coverage\" of the issue. It also detailed that it had conducted an extensive review based on \"additional, unpublished scientific information on TMZ\" in which it consulted with independent scientific experts to test China's contamination theory that \"low doses of TMZ could have benefited the athletes during a swimming competition event.\"\n\nHave Chinese athletes used trimetazidine before?\n\nYes. One of the most high-profile cases involving TMZ is that of China's Olympic gold medallist Sun Yang, who was suspended for three months in 2014 after testing positive for the drug. Sun said he was prescribed the drug by an Olympic team doctor to treat chest pain who was apparently unaware it had been newly added to Wada's banned substances list. Sun was later banned for four years in 2018 after an altercation with drug testers in China involved him destroying blood vials.\n\nWhat medals have China won in swimming?\n\nChina finished fifth in the swimming medals table at the Paris Olympics, with two golds, three silvers and seven bronze medals. Six of those 12 medals were won by Zhang Yufei, who was among the 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for TMZ before the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn response to a frosty reception during her medal ceremony over the weekend, Yufei responded: \"Why are Chinese athletes questioned when they swim fast, but no one dares to question [Michael] Phelps or [Katie] Ledecky previously?. I don't think the doping incident will have any serious impact on us because we are innocent.\"\n\nHow have others responded?\n\nAdam Peaty: \"There's no point winning if you're not winning fair.\"\n\nThree-time British Olympic champion\n\n\"One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is 'there's no point winning if you're not winning fair'. I think you know that's true in your heart. Even if you touch [the wall] and you know you're cheating, you're not winning fair,\" said Peaty.\n\n\"So for me, if you've been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person, I think you should be out of the sport. But we know sport isn't that simple. I've also been asked by people who haven't been under contamination, and I respect that, I don't want to paint a whole nation or a whole group of people with one brush. I think that's very unfair.\n\n\"But there have been two cases of it and I think it's very disappointing. I've tried to keep it out of the conversations until now for the benefit of the team but I think we're going to use that to our advantage over the next four years, whether I'm there or not. I know these boys will carry that and we'll see how they do in four years' time. But I think the people that need to do the job, wake up and do your job.\"\n\nBrett Hawke: 'It's not humanly possible'\n\nAustralian swimming coach who competed in 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games, speaking after Pan's individual gold\n\n\"Look, I'm angry for a number of reasons. Look, my friends are the fastest swimmers in history, from Rowdy Gaines to Alex Popov to Gary Hall Jr, Anthony Ervin and all the way up to King Kyle Chalmers. I know these people intimately, I've studied them for 30 years.\n\n\"I've studied this sport. I've studied speed. I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do, OK. I'm upset right now because you don't win 100m freestyle by a body length on that field. You just don't do it.\n\nIt is not humanly possible to beat that field by a body length. I don't care what you say. This is not a race thing, this is not against any one particular person or nation, this is just what I see and what I know.\n\n\"That's not real, you don't beat that field. Kyle Chalmers, David Popovici, Jack Alexy, you don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100m freestyle. That's not humanly possible, OK, so don't sell it to me, don't shove it down my throat. It's not real.\"\n\nChinada (China Anti-Doping): The New York Times wants to 'weaken our competitive ability'\n\nA statement issued on Wednesday\n\n\"[The New York Times'] main purpose is to disrupt the order of the Paris Olympic swimming competition, affect the psychology of Chinese athletes and weaken their competitive ability. This is extremely unfair and immoral.\"\n\nPan Zhanli: 'There has been no impact on me'\n\n100m gold medalist speaking via a translator after his world record individual win\n\n\"I tried my best to get the best result. I was very surprised in the end that I broke the world record and it was a magical moment.\n\n\"Last year I received 29 tests and never had a positive [result]. From May to July, I had 21 tests, no positive. Today we received a second test already.\n\n\"I don't think there has been any impact [on me] because all the testing has been done in the normal procedure ... So it's not a big issue.\"\n\nSimona Quadarella: We need answers\n\nItalian distance swimmer after it emerged last week that two Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022\n\n\"I think we need some answers from this situation,\" she said. \"We really don't have confidence, in the situation, in the testing system - in the testing system in other parts of the world.\"\n\nCaleb Dressel: Do I have confidence in the case - 'No, not really'\n\nUSA's seven-time gold medalist speaking before the Games started\n\nWhen asked if he had confidence in the doping case against China, Dressel replied: \"No, not really.

I'm very satisfied. I think I can swim even faster,\" he added.\n\nXu, the 100m backstroke silver medallist, gave China the lead after the opening leg, with Qin ensuring they also turned first after the breaststroke.\n\nFrance came surging back, thanks to a sizzling butterfly leg from Maxime Grousset, before Pan swam an incredible 45.92 leg in the freestyle to bring it home for China.\n\nIt is another all-time best all though relay swims for anchors are not recognised because the start doesn't have to be static.\n\nPan's swim surpassed the previous all-time split of a 46.06 that American Jason Lezak swam at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"My whole career I was trying to break 47 seconds, we all were . Everyone on my era, that was the goal, let's try break 47 seconds,\" Australian two-time world champion James Magnussen said on the Matty & The Missle podcast on Monday.\n\n\"I didn't think in my lifetime I'd see a swimmer swim 45 seconds. 45 seconds! For most average people that's a lap. He's done two laps. He doesn't deceslarte he keeps that pace the whole 100.\n\n\"He has been a phenomenon at these Olympics. He's now the worldwide standard in sprint swimming and he'll remain that for the next four years. It's insane what he's done.\"\n\nPan's 100m world record has been met with doubts and suspicion from some.\n\nFive-time Olympian and renowned sprint coach Brett Hawke is among those to raise doubts saying Pan's performances are scarcely believable because of the \"cost and effect\" swimmers faced.\n\n\"If you go out fast, it's going to cost you at the end of the race. If you go out slow you may have something to bring it back,\" Hawke told Sky Sports New..\n\n\"Now, Pan Zhanle went out extremely fast yesterday and came back faster than the best known back-enders in history - Kyle Chalmers, David Popovich - two of the fastest swimmers.\"\n\n\"... Kyle Chalmers is renowned for coming over the top of people and Pan Zhanle from China was pulling away from these two guys.\n\n\"He (Pan) was actually gaining distance on them in the second 50 (metres) after going out faster than any human in history.\n\n\"It makes no sense to be able to go out that fast and come home, and pull away from two of the greatest swimmers in history. Makes no sense.\"\n\nPan and stalwart Zhang Yufei spearheaded China to 12 Olympic medals in the Paris pool, shrugging off intense scrutiny over a doping controversy that engulfed the team ahead of the Games.\n\nTheir haul -- two gold, three silver and seven bronze -- was an improvement on their total Tokyo collection of nine.\n\nOnce again, they finished behind perennial pacesetters the United States and Australia.\n\nThe team came to Paris under a dark cloud after the New York Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ) ahead of Tokyo.\n\nChina claimed it was the result of food contamination -- an explanation accepted by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA).\n\nBut US anti-doping authorities angered their Chinese counterparts by accusing WADA of covering up the facts of the case and the scandal overshadowed their preparations.\n\nButterfly ace Zhang, on the scene for a decade with 10 Olympic medals to her name, including five bronze in Paris, was reportedly among the 23 and admitted it had been stressful in France.\n\n\"I competed very well with friends from different countries, now I come to participate in the Olympic Games I am very worried that my good friends look at me with (suspicious) eyes and they do not want to compete with me,\" she said.\n\n\"I am worried that French people think that Chinese athletes do not deserve to stand on this stage.\" In fact, fans at La Defense Arena were respectful, greeting Chinese athletes with applause.\n\nZhang, who again anchored the team, urged any doubters to look at the details of the case.\n\n\"Each one of us was tested 20 to 30 times in two months, three to four times a week on average,\" she said, noting none were positive.\n\nWorld Aquatics data released days before the Games showed Chinese swimmers in Paris -- including 11 of the 23 embroiled in the doping scandal -- had been tested at least 10 times since the beginning of the year.\n\nIncluding tests conducted by other organisations, Chinese swimmers were tested on average 21 times -- far more than any other nation.\n\nIt wasn't enough, however, to silence the critics when Pan swam an extraordinary 46.40sec to shatter his own 100m freestyle world record.\n\nThe 19-year-old, who was not among the 23 swimmers in the report, called it a \"magic moment\" and Australian silver medallist Kyle Chalmers said he was confident the race was clean.\n\nBut the manner of the win sparked an angry response from Australian Olympian-turned swimming coach Brett Hawke, who mentored Brazil's Cesar Cielo -- the first man to break 47 seconds.\n\n\"I've studied speed. I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do,\" he said on Instagram.\n\n\"You don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100 freestyle. That's not humanly possible.\" Other Chinese on podium included Xu Jiayu with silver in the men's 100m backstroke while Wang Shun earned bronze in the 200m medley behind French hero Leon Marchand.\n\nTang Qianting collected silver in the women's 100m breaststroke. Britain's three-time Olympic champion Adam Peaty found China's gold medal-winning success in the 4x100m medley hard to believe, saying on Sunday \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\n\nYet Peaty aimed his criticism at the anti-doping authorities: \"To the people that need to do their job -- wake up and do your job.\" There were some Chinese misses, notably Qin Haiyang who swept all three breaststroke titles at the 2023 world championships and broke the 200m world record.\n\nQin, reportedly among the 23, wilted in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, fading to seventh in the 100m final and failing to even make the 200m final.\n\nIn China, their performance was praised by most internet users and state-controlled media.\n\nBut fans were angry over the number of tests they were forced to take, sometimes early in the morning which they suggested had an effect on their performances.\n\n\"Chinese sportsmen and women have not been given fair conditions\", said one, in comments that reflected the general tone of reaction.\n\nOfficial media blasted the continued suspicion hanging over the team, despite being cleared by WADA.\n\n\"The Chinese swimming team has been denigrated by part of the Western media, under the impetus of the United States,\" the China Daily newspaper said.\n\n\"This has seriously disrupted the team's training sessions and races.\"",

The result is sure to stir more hard feelings from other nations that feel the Chinese got away with cheating.\n\nBut the real star of the Chinese team was Pan Zhanle, who had previously set a world record while winning the 100 free and powered away from American Hunter Armstrong on the anchor leg to touch in 3 minutes, 27.46 seconds.\n\nThe Americans had to settle for silver in 3:28.01, with France taking bronze in 3:28.38 to give L\u00e9on Marchand his fifth medal of the games to go along with four individual golds.\n\nBritish star Adam Peaty, whose team barely missed out on a medal by finishing fourth, blasted a system that allowed the Chinese swimmers to compete at the Olympics.\n\n\"If you touch and you know you're cheating, you're not winning, right?\" Peaty said. \"As an honorable person, I mean, you should be out of the sport, but we know sport isn't that simple.\"\n\nPeaty noted that after the initial revelations, additional reports surfaced of more positive tests in the Chinese program that went unpunished. The New York Times reported last week that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive, including one 2024 Olympian, for a banned substance in 2022 but were cleared by Chinese officials to compete.\n\n\"I think we've got our faith in the system, but we also don't,\" he said. \"Whoever's in the race, I expect in my head that it has to be fair for them to be there. We did our best job as a team to do that, and it may have been [worthy of] a bronze. Who knows?\"\n\nCaeleb Dressel, who swam the butterfly leg for the Americans, said prior to the Olympics that he didn't have faith in the World Anti-Doping Agency or his sport's governing body, World Aquatics.\n\nWith a silver around his neck, he seemed resigned to the belief that nothing will change.\n\n\"I don't work for WADA,\" Dressel said. \"There's nothing I can do.\"\n\nSwedish gold in the women's 50 free\n\nSarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of Sweden claimed her second gold medal of the Paris Olympics, furiously dashing from one end of the pool to the other to easily claim the 50-meter freestyle title on the final night of swimming Sunday.\n\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 30, competing in her fifth Summer Games, had already won the 100 free -- an event in which she holds the world record but only decided to swim at the urging of her coach.\n\nShe was more surprised than anyone with that victory, which had her overflowing with confidence heading into the 50 free.\n\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m touched in 23.71 seconds, just shy of the world record of 23.61 she set at the 2023 world championships in Fukuoka, Japan.

I think the Olympics is very political, and we have to be very careful that we don't paint a whole nation with one brush, but also that we set a punishment for those people who have cheated and it's very blatant.\n\n\"I know how many times I test in a month. I know who does it -- UKAD, which is in the UK. They're responsible for all the athletes [in the country] but also ITA [the International Testing Agency] on behalf of World Aquatics. Is that model outdated? I believe so. Giving each nation their own responsibility and trust in that nation to test their own athletes. It's bizarre. We should have a full, decentralised testing agency that tests everyone fairly, and I think people should be able to view it.\n\n\"I think the public who are watching the sport and the athletes taking part should be able to view how many times people are tested and potentially along the way, some of the results of those tests.\n\n\"Why not? I'd be happy to share my results, for example. So yes, a very long-winded answer... but I want to play fair. I swim fair. I know how hard I work to get here, and I want to protect the next four years, eight years, the next generation of athletes coming through because there is nothing more heartbreaking than losing to someone who we know is cheating.\"\n\nA total of 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned substance before Tokyo 2020, although they were all allowed to compete. The positive tests first came to light after a bombshell report from the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD.\n\nA Chinese investigation later said the swimmers had consumed food that had been contaminated. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted that result.\n\nOf the Chinese swimmers who tested positive before Tokyo, 11 competed in Paris, including men's breaststroker Qin Haiyang.\n\nHaiyang was billed as Peaty's main rival in the 100-metre breaststroke, although the event was eventually won by Italy's Nicol\u00f2 Martinenghi, with Peaty taking joint-silver and Haiyang surprisingly finishing in seventh.\n\nChina won 12 medals in the swimming pool in Paris, including golds in the men's 4x100-metre medley relay as well as the men's 100-metre freestyle through Zhanle Pan.\n\nAfter the men's mixed relay final, in which Peaty and Team GB came fourth, he noted that additional reports surfaced of more positive tests in the Chinese program that went unpunished.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive, including one 2024 Olympian, for a banned substance in 2022 but were cleared by Chinese officials to compete.\n\nMany other athletes who competed in the pool this week expressed concerns over the scandal and said they had lost faith in WADA.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

All of the swimmers were cleared by the China Anti-Doping Agency (Chinada) which blamed contaminated food. China's 30-member swimming team won six medals at the Tokyo Games, including three golds. Chinada said in a statement to the New York Times that its athletes had not violated any anti-doping laws and it was not obliged to publish any details without the consent of the athlete.\n\nThe revelation of past positive drugs tests among China's team have cast a huge shadow over the Paris Olympics, sparking fears that China is involved in a doping cover-up. It comes after Pan Zhanle, who was not one of the 23 swimmers implicated in the Times story, shaved almost half a second off his 100m freestyle time before setting another record for the fastest anchor leg in the men's 4x100m medley on Sunday night.\n\nThe issue has triggered a diplomatic spat between the US and China, while several Chinese swimmers claim they have been met with a frosty reception by their American and Australian competitors.\n\nTMZ is found in heart medication and helps to metabolise fatty acids, which in turn helps the body to use oxygen. The drug allows for more blood flow to your heart and limits quick changes in blood pressure. Although it was developed for medical use in the 1970s, it only became a banned drug on Wada's list of prohibited substances in 2014.\n\nIn light of the Times report, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) confirmed that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for TMZ before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but accepted the country's findings that this was because of substance contamination.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Wada slammed the \"misleading and potentially defamatory media coverage\" of the issue. It also detailed that it had conducted an extensive review based on \"additional, unpublished scientific information on TMZ\" in which it consulted with independent scientific experts to test China's contamination theory that \"low doses of TMZ could have benefited the athletes during a swimming competition event.\"\n\nYes. One of the most high-profile cases involving TMZ is that of China's Olympic gold medallist Sun Yang, who was suspended for three months in 2014 after testing positive for the drug. Sun said he was prescribed the drug by an Olympic team doctor to treat chest pain who was apparently unaware it had been newly added to Wada's banned substances list. Sun was later banned for four years in 2018 after an altercation with drug testers in China involved him destroying blood vials.\n\nChina finished fifth in the swimming medals table at the Paris Olympics, with two golds, three silvers and seven bronze medals. Six of those 12 medals were won by Zhang Yufei, who was among the 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for TMZ before the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn response to a frosty reception during her medal ceremony over the weekend, Yufei responded: \"Why are Chinese athletes questioned when they swim fast, but no one dares to question [Michael] Phelps or [Katie] Ledecky previously?. I don't think the doping incident will have any serious impact on us because we are innocent.\"\n\n\"One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is 'there's no point winning if you're not winning fair'. I think you know that's true in your heart. Even if you touch [the wall] and you know you're cheating, you're not winning fair,\" said Peaty.\n\n\"So for me, if you've been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person, I think you should be out of the sport. But we know sport isn't that simple. I've also been asked by people who haven't been under contamination, and I respect that, I don't want to paint a whole nation or a whole group of people with one brush. I think that's very unfair.\n\n\"But there have been two cases of it and I think it's very disappointing. I've tried to keep it out of the conversations until now for the benefit of the team but I think we're going to use that to our advantage over the next four years, whether I'm there or not. I know these boys will carry that and we'll see how they do in four years' time. But I think the people that need to do the job, wake up and do your job.\"\n\nBrett Hawke: 'It's not humanly possible'\n\nAustralian swimming coach who competed in 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games, speaking after Pan's individual gold\n\n\"Look, I'm angry for a number of reasons. Look, my friends are the fastest swimmers in history, from Rowdy Gaines to Alex Popov to Gary Hall Jr, Anthony Ervin and all the way up to King Kyle Chalmers. I know these people intimately, I've studied them for 30 years.\n\n\"I've studied this sport. I've studied speed. I understand it. I'm an expert in it, that's what I do, OK. I'm upset right now because you don't win 100m freestyle by a body length on that field. You just don't do it.\n\nIt is not humanly possible to beat that field by a body length. I don't care what you say. This is not a race thing, this is not against any one particular person or nation, this is just what I see and what I know.\n\n\"That's not real, you don't beat that field. Kyle Chalmers, David Popovici, Jack Alexy, you don't beat those guys by one full body length in 100m freestyle. That's not humanly possible, OK, so don't sell it to me, don't shove it down my throat. It's not real.\"\n\nChinada (China Anti-Doping): The New York Times wants to 'weaken our competitive ability'\n\nA statement issued on Wednesday\n\n\"[The New York Times'] main purpose is to disrupt the order of the Paris Olympic swimming competition, affect the psychology of Chinese athletes and weaken their competitive ability. This is extremely unfair and immoral.\"\n\nPan Zhanli: 'There has been no impact on me'\n\n100m gold medalist speaking via a translator after his world record individual win\n\n\"I tried my best to get the best result. I was very surprised in the end that I broke the world record and it was a magical moment.\n\n\"Last year I received 29 tests and never had a positive [result]. From May to July, I had 21 tests, no positive. Today we received a second test already.\n\n\"I don't think there has been any impact [on me] because all the testing has been done in the normal procedure ... So it's not a big issue.\"\n\nSimona Quadarella: We need answers\n\nItalian distance swimmer after it emerged last week that two Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022\n\n\"I think we need some answers from this situation,\" she said. \"We really don't have confidence, in the situation, in the testing system - in the testing system in other parts of the world.\"\n\nCaleb Dressel: Do I have confidence in the case - 'No, not really'\n\nUSA's seven-time gold medalist speaking before the Games started\n\nWhen asked if he had confidence in the doping case against China, Dressel replied: \"No, not really.

Even if you touch and you know you're cheating, you're not winning, right? So, for me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honorable person it means you should be out of the sport. We know sport is not that simple.\"\n\nQin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, both part of the victorious relay team, were among the Chinese swimmers who had tested positive for a prohibited substance prior to the Tokyo Games. Despite the positive test results, they were still permitted to participate in the competition.\n\n\"The whole Olympic Games journey for me is great,\" Xu said. \"I am very satisfied.\"\n\nThe New York Times recently revealed that in 2022, two additional Chinese swimmers, including a potential 2024 Olympian, had positive tests for a prohibited substance.\n\nHowever, Chinese authorities allowed them to continue competing despite the findings.\n\nIn response to the report, the World Anti-Doping Agency maintained its stance on the decision to exonerate the 23 swimmers who were found to have used a banned heart medication. The agency upheld its original ruling, permitting the athletes to participate in competitions.\n\n\"We have to put our trust in WADA,\" American Caeleb Dressel said when asked if he considered it a fair race. \"I honestly haven't paid too much attention to it because a lot of that is out of my control. I don't work for WADA, there's nothing I can do. ...\n\n\"I'm trying to race really tough, and they were the better team, and it's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are engaged in a dispute with U.S. anti-doping authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI's involvement stems from a robust legislation that grants U.S. law enforcement the authority to investigate sports doping cases on a global scale, particularly in relation to the Chinese situation.\n\nThroughout the week, Peaty maintained his silence, but ultimately decided to express his disappointment and frustrations with what he perceives as a broken system.\n\n\"China earned bronze in the women's 4x100 medley shortly after the men's victory. Zhang Yufei, another one of the swimmers among the 23, was on the team.\"\n\nPeaty acknowledged the presence of anger and frustration among those involved in the situation.\n\n\"I don't want to paint a whole nation or a whole group of people with one brush, I think it's very unfair,\" Peaty said. \"But there have been two cases of it and I think it's very disappointing, and I've tried to keep out of the conversations until now for the betterment of the team but I think we're going to use that to our advantage the next four years, whether I'm there or not. I know these boys will carry that.\n\n\"We'll see how they do in four years' time, but I think the people that need to do the job will wake up and do the job.\"\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

They were allowed to compete without any sanctions, and they weren't identified until media reports this year reported failed tests that went unpunished.\n\nWang, mirroring Zhang's comments earlier this week, said he was tested extensively ahead of Paris.\n\n\"Chinese swimmers only compete cleanly,\" he said through a translator. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nWang Shun, of China, competes in the men's 200-meter individual medley semifinal at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024, in Nanterre, France.

Leon Marchand, France's superhuman swimmer who could clean up with four golds at his home Olympics, has earned the lion's share of the rapturous support over the past week, but plenty of the ear-splitting noise has been reserved for other nations too.\n\nCanadian teen sensation Summer McIntosh - a prodigious talent who has announced herself as a superstar at these Games at the tender age of 17 with two golds and a silver - has proved a firm favourite among fans. As has American Katie Ledecky, who earlier this week became the USA's most decorated female Olympic swimmer of all time in Paris, while Australia's domineering women's 4x200m freestyle relay were roared home in an Olympic record time before fireworks on the podium.\n\nBut when it comes to Chinese swimmers, the mood has felt palpably different. Doping allegations among the country's swimming team have loomed large over these Games ever since it emerged that 23 of their athletes at Tokyo 2020 failed drugs tests for a banned heart medication, 11 of whom are competing in the Paris Olympics. It makes for grim reading in a sport that has constantly battled to clean up its image and it has now spilled over into the court of public opinion. With its chequered past, the public perception is that China should be eyed with suspicion.\n\nTake, for example, the women's 200 metre freestyle medal ceremony on Thursday evening. When China's Zhang Yufei stepped up on to the podium after claiming bronze, she was all smiles despite having been unable to defend her crown from Tokyo. She was visibly thrilled, the crowd less so. Those with sharp hearing could detect the faintest boos rippling around the arena.\n\nZhang had been one of the swimmers named in an investigation by The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD when the saga was first reported in April this year. The 26-year-old had found herself facing questions over the debacle as early as last week, when she stressed that her teammates had been subjected to a vigorous monthly testing regime in the build-up to Paris.\n\nInstead of answering happy questions about winning bronze, Zhan found herself sticking up for her compatriot, Pan Zhanle, an apparent freak of nature who stunned everyone with a 46.40 world record in the men's 100 metre freestyle. Pan, it should be noted, was not one of the swimmers implicated in the Tokyo doping story, but his astonishing performance in the pool was enough to raise eyebrows.\n\nZhang said: \"Pan had consistently swum under 47 seconds prior to achieving his new world record, indicating a stable and continuous improvement rather than a sudden leap in performance. Pan's achievements were legitimate and attained under stringent anti-doping protocols.\"\n\nIndeed, Zhang went further when she blatantly asked why people were not questioning other outstanding swimmers from other countries.\n\nZhang said: \"Why are Chinese athletes questioned when they achieve fast times, yet no one doubted Michael Phelps when he won seven or eight gold medals? Similarly, Katie Ledecky has dominated long-distance swimming from 2012 to 2024, winning gold in every event, yet no one questioned her performances.\"\n\nIn an ugly twist, Mark Adams, the spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee, was unable to guarantee that China's swimming team is fully clean. \"They are the most tested swimming team here, in swimming,\" he said, fudging a diplomatic answer when the question was put to him on Friday. \"[There have been] 600 and something tests routinely since January. So they are fully tested. And by the way, similarly, ahead of Tokyo, they were - targeted is the wrong word - but clearly when there were issues with the sport in the country with an individual and the ITA made sure that was dealt with in terms of the testing protocols.\n\n\"Can you ever say that with any team - [it's] never 100 per cent - but all the work is being done,\" he said. \"Let me get that right. I'm not making any aspersions toward this Chinese team - just in general I would say it's difficult to ever know, but all of the tests have been done and we continue to see great performances and that's what we want to see at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nInnocent, of course, until proven guilty - a principle that is becoming harder to live by in an age where athletes are mercilessly subjected to trials by social media. The Parisian crowds, it seems, have already made their minds up over this embattled Chinese contingent.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [],

But outside China, their success has been met with scrutiny - including from some of their peers in the world of elite swimming.\n\nThe Chinese swim team has come under immense pressure following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.\n\nThe swimmers had been cleared by China's Anti-Doping Agency shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for a banned heart medication were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.\n\nThe accusations, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, have sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules.\n\nConcern only deepened last week, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for trace amounts of a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by Chinese officials - again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.\n\nIn China, many social media users saw the Chinese swim team's historic win in the relay as a resounding vindication.\n\nThe victory dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Monday, creating several top trending topics on microblogging site Weibo. The hashtag \"Pan Zhanle's stunning reversal\" racked up more than 500 million views, as did another hashtag about the relay gold medal.\n\nPan, who turned 20 on Sunday, called the team gold medal his birthday present.\n\n\"I fulfilled the promise I made a year ago by celebrating my 20th birthday with a team gold medal,\" he wrote in a viral post on Weibo, where the swimmer became an overnight celebrity with 1.6 million followers.\n\n\"A new journey has begun, and the goals have been quietly set. I hope I can make an even greater contribution to the team. The Chinese swim team is always the best!\"\n\nPan also won fans for his confidence and candidness.\n\nIn a pool-side interview with state broadcaster CCTV right after the event, some of Pan's teammates said they were not happy with their own performance in the earlier legs of the relay. Pan cheered and praised his teammates: \"The race is over, and the championship is ours. It shouldn't be us who are dissatisfied; it should be the others.\"\n\nIn China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the doping allegations have brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment - especially over the scrutiny the team has faced this summer.\n\nNearly a dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive three years ago are competing in the Paris Olympics, including two of the quartet that won relay gold on Sunday.\n\nDouble gold-medalist Pan did not test positive in 2021, but he has also faced questions over his stellar performance in Paris.\n\nAfter Pan smashed the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympic swimmer and coach, posted on Instagram that \"it's not humanly possible to beat that field\" and that the swim was \"not real life. Not in that pool, against that field.\"\n\nBack in China, state media and internet users have rallied to Pan's defense. On Monday, many Chinese social media users applauded Pan for defying the pressure and proving his accusers wrong.\n\n\"If breaking the record the first time didn't convince the foreigners, this stunning reversal surely did. (Pan's) so impressive and dominant!\" said a comment with 2,300 upvotes.\n\n\"Our strength speaks for itself. We won the gold fair and square,\" said another.\n\nBut overseas, doubts linger.\n\nAfter Sunday's relay, British triple Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty called for stricter doping testing after the British team finished fourth in the race.\n\n\"I think we've got to have faith in the system, but we also don't,\" he said, according to Reuters. \"I think it's just got to be stricter.\"\n\n\"One of my favorite quotes I've seen lately is there's no point in winning if you don't win it fair,\" Peaty said. \"And I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you're cheating, you don't win it, right.\n\n\"So, for me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honorable person, you should be out of the sport.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Many of them were eventually allowed to compete in the event.\n\nIn photos circulated by nationalist commentators and bloggers on the microblogging platform Weibo this week, American medalists Kate Douglass, Regan Smith and Torri Huske are seen gazing up at the scoreboard after their races while still floating in the pool, their faces looking pinkish red.\n\nThe redness, many social media users claim, is a sign of drug use.\n\n'The two American athletes' faces looked very odd,' wrote a blogger in a post that has received thousands of likes, referring to Huske and her teammate Gretchen Walsh, who won gold and silver respectively in the women's 100-meter butterfly final.\n\n'They are so red that they look almost purple,' the post wrote. 'Did the gold and silver medalists take drugs? They should get tested.'\n\nHuske, who has won one gold and two silvers so far in Paris, has become the biggest target of doping accusations. Her photos have been widely shared on Chinese social media.\n\nLin Bo, who is a Chinese medicine physician according to his Weibo bio, claimed that the redness on Huske's face is a 'typical reaction to drugs.'\n\nHowever, personal photos of the 21-year-old Virginian on her Instagram account show that the red tint has always been there.\n\nA screenshot of several posts on the Instagram account of U.S. swimmer and Olympic gold medalist Torri Huske.\n\nMedical experts say red or pinkish skin is quite common for some people because exercise can cause the cells in the skin to release histamine, which causes the blood vessels to widen, adding to the exercise-induced flushing - especially with intense exertion, such as swimming.\n\nSome red face photos used by netizens to cast doubt on the integrity of U.S. athletes are of French swimmer Anastasiia Kirpichnikova.\n\nU.S. gymnast Simone Biles, who has won two golds in Paris, has also been attacked on the Chinese internet.\n\nIn a popular post on Weibo, a commentator questions whether Biles' medications for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, which she has been granted an exemption to take, have given her an unfair advantage in competitions.\n\nVOA has reached out to the International Olympics Committee, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency for comments but has not yet received a reply from the latter two organizations.\n\nIn a reply, the International Olympics Committee wrote that 'anti-doping matters have been made independent from the IOC.'\n\nChina faces doping scandal\n\nThe unfounded online allegations against the American athletes come at a time when Beijing is trying to fend off a massive doping scandal involving some of China's best swimmers.\n\nIn April, The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned heart medication at a 2021 sporting event. After an investigation conducted by the China Anti-Doping Agency or CHINADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, accepted its conclusion that the testing results were caused by accidental contamination.\n\nWADA confirmed the reporting. In a public statement, it said that it stands by its decision not to punish the athletes, as the concentrations of TMZ, a performance-enhancing substance, detected in the samples were so low that it wouldn't have had any effect on performance.\n\nSome of the involved swimmers went on to compete in the Tokyo Olympics that year, including Zhang Yufei and Wang Shun, who together won three gold medals for China.\n\nOn July 30, The New York Times reported another doping incident that had led to no punishment for involved Chinese athletes. Two swimmers tested positive in 2022 for a banned drug. Chinese authorities, after looking into the matter, said that it was another case of sample contamination and that the swimmers had eaten hamburgers that contained the substance by accident.\n\nWADA accepted Beijing's conclusion and, in a statement, blamed the U.S. media for the 'politicization of anti-doping' issues.\n\nCHINADA, in a statement, called out The New York Times for 'disrupting the order of the swimming competitions of the Paris Olympics, disturbing the Chinese athletes and ultimately undermining their performance at the Paris games.'\n\nBeijing hasn't responded to the July 30 report. But in April, Wang Wenbin, then spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, responded to The New York Times' and ARD's earlier reporting by calling it 'false information.'\n\nSome say West made up scandals\n\nIn China, where access to Western media is limited and social media is often filled with anti-U.S. narratives, many say the doping scandals were manufactured by the West to undermine China's image in sports.\n\nWang Guan, a host for China's state media China Global Television Network, wrote in a social media post that the 'Western sports sphere' is collectively 'hyping up the so-called doping incidents of Chinese swimmers at the Paris Olympics' to 'kill our reputation.'\n\nZhang, one of the swimmers involved in the 2021 doping incident, spoke up about what she perceives as unfairness toward Chinese athletes in Paris.\n\n'Why are Chinese athletes questioned when they swim fast, but nobody dared to doubt Michael Phelps when he won eight gold medals?' she asks, referring to the former American swimmer's performance in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nSome nationalist commentators called on the International Olympics Committee, or IOC, to further scrutinize American athletes.\n\nShen Yi, an international relations professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a new video column that the United States is in decline, which is why it wants to suppress China's rise. He said that the IOC should state publicly whether each American athlete who won medals has been allowed to use certain health-related medications.\n\n'[Let's see] how many of them are from the 'Purple Skin Corps,'' he said, alluding to the allegation that U.S. swimmers' red faces indicate doping.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland

After this Olympics I'd like to experience other aspects in life.\"\n\nZhang won three other bronze medals in 100 and 200 butterfly and the 4x100 freestyle relay. She also won silver in the mixed 4x100 medley relay.\n\nNot adding to the gold medals she won in the 200 butterfly and 4x200 freestyle relay in Tokyo might have been a disappointment for some of her fans back home but not for Zhang.\n\n\"If you look at my times in the individual races, they weren't that good,\" Zhang said. \"That considered I still won six medals. For me personally that was already a huge breakthrough. I feel especially proud of myself.\"\n\nZhang, like 10 other Chinese swimmers, was competing in Paris in the shadow of a doping row that dominated the run-up to the Games.\n\nThe New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported in April that Zhang was among 23 Chinese swimmers that were allowed to compete in the Tokyo Olympics despite testing positive earlier that year for heart medication trimetazidine, a drug banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nWADA has confirmed that 23 tested positive but not named any of them. It accepted the findings of a Chinese investigation that the test results were due to contamination from a hotel kitchen the team were staying at.\n\nAn independent investigation last month ruled WADA did not mishandle or show favouritism, while a World Aquatics audit concluded there was no mismanagement or cover-up by the governing body.\n\n\"We are innocent,\" Zhang told reporters last week during the swimming competition.\n\n\"World Aquatics and other parties have already got to the bottom of everything and clarified online. If some people still don't believe it, we are not going to refute any more in vain, because innocence will prevail.\"\n\nAlthough Zhang is planning to take a break, she still hopes to take part in her fourth Games in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I would like to focus on the relays for the next Olympics,\" she said.\n\n\"(Sarah) Sjostrom is still my idol and my goal.

revelations in April that 23 of the country's swimmers tested positive for a banned heart medication before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics but were allowed to compete.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the findings of a Chinese investigation that the results were due to contamination from a hotel kitchen, and an independent review backed WADA's handling of the case.\n\nThe New York Times also reported last week that two of the country's swimmers tested positive in 2022 for a banned steroid, also blamed on contaminated food, but had provisional suspensions lifted.\n\nChina's anti-doping agency (CHINADA) has since accused the US newspaper of politicising doping issues and said the publication was trying to \"affect the psychology\" of Chinese athletes at the Olympics.\n\n\"One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is there's no point in winning if you don't win it fair,\" said Peaty. \"And I think you know that truth in your heart.", "source": {"uri":

I just happened to see it.\"\n\nSun missed out on a chance to compete at the Paris Games with his doping suspension not ending until May, after the Chinese national championships had taken place.\n\nSun was suspended for eight years by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2020 after smashing vials of blood during a 2018 doping test.\n\nHe was banned for three months in 2014 for a separate doping offence, but has always protested his innocence in the murky events of September 2018.\n\nHe succeeded in reducing the ban after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but the ban remained in place for four-years and three-months.\n\nThe Chinese swimmer has expressed an interest in returning to competition \"as soon as possible\".\n\nHowever, if he hopes to reclaim his 1500m Olympic record, he would be 36-years-old when the 2028 Olympics are held in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I hope that I'll be able to pick a competition and return to the starting block as soon as possible,\" Sun said in an interview published by state-run media outlet The Paper after his doping ban came to an end in May.\n\nAhead of the Olympics getting underway, China was thrust into the spotlight with the swim team implicated in a major doping scandal.\n\nTwenty-three Chinese swimmers tested positive for the heart drug trimetazidine (TMZ) -- which can enhance performance -- ahead of the pandemic-delayed 2021 Tokyo Games, it emerged in April.\n\nThey were not sanctioned after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the argument of Chinese authorities that the positive tests were caused by food contamination.\n\nChinese officials tested Australian beef as they tried to establish the source of how two of the country's swimmers tested positive to a banned substance.\n\nChina told the World Anti-Doping Agency it believed two swimmers, Tang Muhan and He Junyi, ate contaminated burgers at a Beijing fast food restaurant in October 2022.\n\nBoth returned positive samples for \"trace amounts\" of metandienone - a banned steroid known for use in meat production.\n\nAustralia's meat industry has hit back at suggestions its products could be to blame, with Meat and Livestock

He said he was tested 28 times and \"an average of twice a week\" when finishing his qualification for the Chinese Olympic team.\n\nHe also spoke of recent tests saying, \"The two weeks before the Olympic Games, I was tested 11 times.

Almost 200 drug tests were taken by the swimmers during the first 10 days. Breaststroker Qin Haiyang, who also tested positive back in 2021, spoke of the frequency of testing earlier this week. Qin said, \"The tests come early in the morning before we're even awake, during midday rest periods, forcing us to rest on hotel lobby sofas, and even late at night, keeping us up past midnight.\"", "source": {"uri": "swimswam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SwimSwam"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anya_pelshaw@swimswam.com", "name": "Anya Pelshaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Shun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Shun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimetazidine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trimetazidine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doping in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Haiyang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qin Haiyang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wang-Shun-By-Jack-Spitser-DSC01730-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785938", "eventUri": "eng-9785938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

April.\n\nThey were not sanctioned after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the argument of Chinese authorities that the positive tests were caused by food contamination.\n\nChinese

banned steroid known for use in meat production.\n\nAustralia's meat industry has hit back at suggestions its products could be to blame, with Meat and Livestock Australia saying metandienone \"is not

His trauma stems from a notorious New York Magazine cover story from 1985, about a group of popular young actors (including Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez and others), that was headlined: \u201cHollywood\u2019s Brat Pack.\u201d Reading it today, David Blum\u2019s article about hanging out with a group of movie stars with the world \u2014 and many women \u2014 at their feet as they hit Hollywood clubs and sow their wild oats seems tame and fun. But for McCarthy, now 61, the \u201cBrat Pack\u201d label ghettoized and diminished the actors, who were part of a talented new generation of young stars heating up the box office with movies like \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d \u2014 considered the pre-eminent Brat Pack film \u2014 \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cTaps,\u201d \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d \u201cAbout Last Night,\u201d \u201cSixteen Candles\u201d and others. \u201cOh f\u2013k,\u201d was McCarthy\u2019s first reaction to seeing the cover story, as he reveals in \u201cBRATS,\u201d a new documentary he wrote, directed and stars in. \u201cI just thought that was terrible instantly. And it turns out, I was right. The article was scathing about all these young actors. And the phrase being such a clever, witty phrase, it caught the zeitgeist instantly and burned deep and that was it. From then on my career and the career of everyone involved was branded to the \u2018Brat Pack,'\u201d he says in the doc. \u201cBRATS,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Festival this weekend and begins airing on Hulu Thursday, is McCarthy\u2019s somewhat head-scratching journey into what was, for him, the heart of darkness of that bygone era immortalized by Blum\u2019s catchy phrase. \u201cWe were branded as \u2018partying, wanting to have a good time, get famous\u2019\u2026,\u201d he says in the movie. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to anybody about what that was like. It certainly was the defining thing in my life. And I imagined it was in theirs as well. So I thought it might be interesting to try and contact everyone who was in the Brat Pack or who might have been associated with it.\u201d Exactly who was officially a member remains a bit of a parlor game to this day. Estevez, Lowe, McCarthy and Nelson, along with Anthony Michael Hall, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy, are often cited as the pre-eminent Brat Pack members \u2014 with Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, Timothy Hutton sometimes included in the group. Brat Pack-adjacent members include Jon Cryer, James Spade, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Bacon, Matthew Broderick, Lea Thompson and Mare Winningham. Blum\u2019s story was originally just supposed to profile Emilio Estevez, now 62. But when Estevez, who is Charlie Sheen\u2019s older brother, invited Blum out to a night at the Hard Rock Cafe with his buddies and co-stars including Lowe and Nelson, Blum realized there was a bigger piece showing life inside their hot, privileged bubble. \u201cThe Brat Pack is to the 1980s what the Rat Pack was to the 1960s \u2014 a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women and a good time,\u201d Blum wrote in the 1985 article. \u201cAnd just like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr., these guys work together, too \u2014 they\u2019ve carried their friendships over from life into the movies. They make major movies with big directors and get fat contracts and limousines. They have top agents and protective PR people. They have legions of fans who write them letters, buy them drinks, follow them home. And, most important, they sell movie tickets.\u201d McCarthy is mentioned only once in Blum\u2019s article, in a derogatory aside made by one of McCarthy\u2019s co-stars in \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d who was not named. \u201c\u201cHe plays all his roles with too much of the same intensity. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it,\u201d the unidentified castmate said of McCarthy. Blum, who has in the past expressed some regrets over the article, did not return a call from The Post. He appears briefly in the doc with McCarthy, People writes, and the two have a rapprochement as Blum explains the infamous headline was meant to be clever, not cruel. Fortunately for McCarthy, many of his big-name former co-stars and peers of that era, including Estevez, Lowe, Sheedy, Hutton, Cryer and Moore agreed to be interviewed for \u201cBRATS.\u201d Most of them he hadn\u2019t seen, McCarthy says in it, for 35 years. To an extent, that unidentified castmate was right. McCarthy has not had the same success as some of the group he started out with, like Moore, Cruise and Lowe, but he\u2019s worked steadily as an actor and director and has had a critically-lauded career as an author and travel writer. He is married to his second wife, Irish writer and actress Dolores Rice, and has three children, one of whom, Sam McCarthy, 22, is an actor. In the film, McCarthy is seen driving everywhere from Estevez\u2019s Malibu home to somewhere in the upstate New York woods to check in with Hutton. An especially gracious Ally Sheedy talks to McCarthy in her living room. None of the actors seem to be as affected by the Brat Pack label as McCarthy, but they all gamely play along, reflecting on their own issues with it. A running theme in the documentary is McCarthy\u2019s frequent admissions of what appears to be low self-esteem. In the film, he refers to himself as sometimes being \u201cshame-based\u201d and often feeling as if he is being \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d for no reason. \u201cI always felt like he was sort of an insider in some clubs, and I always felt like a guy on the outside,\u201d McCarthy muses as he drives to Estevez\u2019s house. \u201cI lived in New York all the other guys lived here and Emilio seemed to know more than anybody like what the deal was.\u201d Estevez, like Sheedy and, to some degree, Lowe and others, agreed that he didn\u2019t like the article and had felt betrayed. \u201cI had done some press but nothing to the extent of a real profile and it really made me think it was naive of me to think that this journalist would in fact, be my friend,\u201d Estevez tells McCarthy in the film. \u201cThe most upsetting part of it was that I had already seen a different path for myself and I felt derailed.\u201d McCarthy visits a barefoot, blue-jean-clad Moore at her home and she is sympathetic to his belief that the Brat Pack label was a bit of a stigma. But then she leans into McCarthy as if she were his therapist and gives him a bit of a reality check. \u201cWhy did we take it as an offense? That\u2019s why did we take it as something bad?\u201d asks Moore, whose own real-life traumas include a neglectful, alcoholic mother, a father who killed himself and being raped as a teenager. Moore was once engaged to Estevez and admits she had a sober minder on the set of \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d as she successfully battled to stay sober. \u201cI was irritated and felt it was a real limited perspective,\u201d Moore says in the movie about reading the article for the first time. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I took it as that personal over time, maybe then as you did. Yes it came out and it tried to diminish us but it was also an opportunity to rise above it and say no, I am much more than that.\u201d Moore suggests to McCarthy that the Brat Pack article was a form of something she called \u201can againstness,\u201d adding that for McCarthy to continue to view it as something negative and see people as against him it would only perpetuate the problem. \u201cAgainstness only provokes againstness,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThen you\u2019re predisposed to re-creating it until you hit a point where you don\u2019t want to do that anymore.\u201d Molly Ringwald, who is seen in clips from her movies, declined to participate but sounded as if she adheres to Moore\u2019s philosophy. \u201cMolly said she\u2019d think about it,\u201d McCarthy tells Jon Cryer when they meet up and Cryer asks if he\u2019s spoken to their \u201cPretty In Pink\u201d co-star, \u201cbut that she\u2019d probably just like to keep looking forward.\u201d", "summary": "\"Oh f--k,\" Andrew McCarthy (\"Pretty in Pink,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\") recalls of hearing the \"Brat Pack\" label for the first time.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/entertainment/andrew-mccarthy-says-brat-pack-stigma-gave-him-ptsd/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-iapjlec84-1717788344330.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717843096&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8vKyfHZC-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:38:26", "author": "Dana Kennedy", "authors": ["Dana Kennedy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.322}

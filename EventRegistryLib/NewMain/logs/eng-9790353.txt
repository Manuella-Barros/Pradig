The senior lawyer contended the LG should have taken back the nominations by now.\n\n\"There are 12 zones, 12 ward committees and aldermen can be appointed to any committee...for the first time in the last 30 years, the LG has directly appointed members in the MCD and earlier it was always based on aid and advice (of the government),\" Singhvi had said in this arguments.\n\nOn May 12, last year, the top court observed that LG has to act on the \"aid and advice\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government in nominating 10 aldermen to the MCD.\n\nBesides seeking quashing of the nominations, the plea of AAP government filed through lawyer Shadan Farasat has sought a direction to the LG's office to nominate members to the MCD under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act...,\" in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers\".

The MCD comprises 250 elected members and 10 nominated ones.\n\nJustice P S Narasimha, pronouncing the judgment, said the LG can independently nominate 10 aldermen to MCD and he is not required to act as per aid and advice of the elected government. The apex court said the power expressed by the statute on LG shows the statutory schemes in which power is distributed.\n\nJustice Narasimha said it is the law made by the parliament, it satisfies the discretion exercised by LG, since the law requires him to do so and falls under the exception of Article 239. He said that it was 1993 Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act, which first vested the power to nominate on the LG and it is not a relic of the past.\n\nThe apex court made it clear that the Delhi LG is expected to act as per the mandate of the statute. The detailed judgment on the matter will be uploaded later in the day.\n\nThe apex court delivered its verdict on a plea of the Aam Aadmi Party-led (AAP) Delhi government challenging the LG's decision to nominate aldermen in the MCD without the aid and advice of the council of ministers. The verdict came nearly 15 months after the court concluded hearings on the matter.\n\nA three-judge bench led by CJI DY Chandrachud, along with justices Narasimha and J.B. Pardiwala, had reserved the verdict in the matter on May 17, last year.\n\nDuring the hearing, the apex court had observed that giving the LG the power to nominate aldermen will effectively mean that he can destabilise a democratically-elected MCD because these aldermen get appointed to the standing committees and have voting power.\n\nSenior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, had argued that the LG had bypassed this issue by ignoring the aid and advice of the state cabinet. The state government contended that this was the first instance since Article 239AA of the Constitution came into effect in 1991 where the Lieutenant Governor nominated aldermen to the MCD without consulting the elected government.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narasimha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narasimha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.B._Pardiwala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.B.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had filed a plea in the apex court against LG's decision stating LG did not seek aid and advice of the Delhi government in the matter.\n\nA bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices Narasimha, JB Pardiwala said that LG is expected to act as per the statutory mandate and not as per the aid and advice of the Delhi government. Since it was a statutory power and not an executive power, the LG was expected to act as per the statutory mandate and not as per the aid and advice of the Delhi Government, it added.\n\n\"Delhi LG is expected to act as per the mandate of the statute and not the aid and advice of council of ministers,\" said the top court while pronouncing the judgement.\n\nThe verdict by the Supreme Court came on the plea by AAP-led Delhi government challenging the nominations of 10 'aldermen' by the LG to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. In May 2023, the apex court had reserved the judgement. AAP government contended that the nominations were made in the ward committees of the MCD where BJP was weak.\n\nCounsel appearing for LG contended that \"aid and advice\" of the Delhi government was not required while exercising a statutory power which was specifically conferred on the Administrator. After AAP won the municipal elections, the LG appointed 10 'aldermen' that were opposed by Delhi government. In its plea, the Delhi government sought quashing of orders dated 3rd January and 4th January 2023 where the LG nominated 10 persons as the nominated members of the MCD.\n\nDelhi government stated that LG \"illegally appointed the members to MCD on his own initiative without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. This is the first time since Article 239AA came into effect in 1991 that such a nomination has been made by the LG completely by-passing the elected government, thereby arrogating to an unelected office a power that belongs to the duly elected government,\" Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government had said.\n\nIt had sought direction \"to nominate members to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\"\n\n\"It is pertinent to note that neither the section nor any other provision of law says anywhere that such nomination is to be made by the Administrator in his discretion. As such, under the scheme of Article 239AA of the Constitution, the word \"Administrator\" must necessarily be read as Administrator / Lieutenant Governor, acting on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and the Lieutenant Governor was bound to make the nominations on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,\" the plea had added.\n\nIn the present case, the Lieutenant Governor has not been vested with any discretionary authority to make nominations to the MCD under either a constitutional provision, or any statutory provision, the Aam Aadmi Party had said.\n\n\"Accordingly, the only two courses of action open to him were to either accept the proposed names duly recommended to him for nomination to MCD by the elected government, or to differ with the proposal, and refer the same to the President. It was not open to him at all to make nominations on his own initiative, completely circumventing the elected government. As such, the nominations made by the Lieutenant Governor are ultra vires and illegal, and are consequently liable to be quashed,\" the plea had added.\n\nReacting to the judgment, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said, \"I think this is a very big blow to Indian democracy and by bypassing the elected government, you are giving all the rights to LG. I think this is not good for democracy and the Constitution of India. I want to say with due respect that we completely disagree with this decision. This decision is against the spirit of democracy, and it is completely opposite to the comments of the court during the hearing...After reading the full order, we will make a strategy as to what to do next.\"\n\nAccording to the DMC Act, Delhi is divided into 12 zones. The Act also creates a Wards Committee for each zone that has elected representatives and aldermen within the territory. The LG of Delhi has the power to nominate 10 aldermen who must be above the age of 25 years and have \"special knowledge or experience in municipal administration\". These aldermen do not have the right to vote in the MCD meetings. However, they play a crucial role in the functioning of the MCD through the Ward Committee.\n\nNotably, every ward committee has to elect a member to be a part of the MCD Standing Committee in the first meeting. Aldermen have the right to vote in these elections and stand as candidates for being elected as members of the committee. Six Standing Committee members get elected directly by the MCS house after the election of the mayor.\n\nEven though the Mayor is the head of the MCD, it is the standing committee that effectively manages the functioning of the MCD. The standing committee cannot be constituted without the votes of aldermen. If there is no standing committee, MCD cannot enter into contracts of more than Rs 5 crore. Furthermore, the committee plays a crucial role in appointing MCD officers, recommending budget revisions and approving any exercise of power that involves expenditure beyond the current financial year.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

The power to be exercised is the statutory duty of the LG and not the executive power of the state. This is how we analysed the constitutional provisions,\" Justice Narasimha said while pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the bench.\n\nThe bench said the statutory power under provision 3(3)(b)(1) which deals with nomination of persons having special knowledge was vested with the LG for the first time by the 1993 amendment of the DMC Act of 1957.\n\nThe bench said the DMC Act as amended in 1993 recognises five authorities exercising the state's power and duties under the Act -- these are the Central government, the government of NCT, administrator, corporation and the commissioner. It said the amendment Act of 1993 carries out several amendments to the original DMC Act of 1957 by which the power, duties were allocated to the authorities depending on the function they perform under the law.\n\nThe bench said by way of the amendment the power of nomination of aldermen was given to LG under the provision just like the power of nomination of MLAs was given to the speaker of the House.\n\nOn May 17 last year, the top court had said that giving the LG the power to nominate aldermen to the MCD will mean he can destabilise an elected civic body.\n\nThe MCD has 250 elected and 10 nominated members.\n\nIn December 2022, the Aam Aadmi Party defeated the BJP in the civic elections, winning 134 wards and ending the saffron party's 15-year run at the helm of the MCD. The BJP won 104 seats and the Congress finished a distant third with nine.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, had contended during the hearing that no separate powers have been accorded to the state government to nominate people to the MCD. For the past 30 years, the practice of the LG nominating aldermen on the aid and advice of the city government has been followed, he said.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the LG's office, submitted that just because a practice has been followed for 30 years does not mean it is correct.\n\nThe top court had observed that giving the LG the power to nominate aldermen will effectively mean that he can destabilise a democratically elected MCD because these aldermen get appointed to the standing committees and have voting power.\n\nEarlier, the top court had questioned the \"source of power\" of the LG under the Constitution and the law to nominate aldermen to the MCD without the aid and advice of the elected government.\n\nOn May 12 last year, the top court observed that LG has to act on the \"aid and advice\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government in nominating 10 aldermen to the MCD.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news",

The power to be exercised is the statutory duty of the LG and not the executive power of the state. This is how we analysed the constitutional provisions,\" Justice Narasimha said while pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the bench.\n\nThe bench said the statutory power under provision 3(3)(b)(1) which deals with nomination of persons having special knowledge was vested with the LG for the first time by the 1993 amendment of the DMC Act of 1957.\n\nThe bench said the DMC Act as amended in 1993 recognises five authorities exercising the state's power and duties under the Act -- these are the Central government, the government of NCT, administrator, corporation and the commissioner. It said the amendment Act of 1993 carries out several amendments to the original DMC Act of 1957 by which the power, duties were allocated to the authorities depending on the function they perform under the law.\n\nThe bench said by way of the amendment the power of nomination of aldermen was given to LG under the provision just like the power of nomination of MLAs was given to the speaker of the House.\n\nOn May 17 last year, the top court had said that giving the LG the power to nominate aldermen to the MCD will mean he can destabilise an elected civic body.\n\nThe MCD has 250 elected and 10 nominated members.\n\nIn December 2022, the Aam Aadmi Party defeated the BJP in the civic elections, winning 134 wards and ending the saffron party's 15-year run at the helm of the MCD. The BJP won 104 seats and the Congress finished a distant third with nine.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, had contended during the hearing that no separate powers have been accorded to the state government to nominate people to the MCD. For the past 30 years, the practice of the LG nominating aldermen on the aid and advice of the city government has been followed, he said.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the LG's office, submitted that just because a practice has been followed for 30 years does not mean it is correct.\n\nThe top court had observed that giving the LG the power to nominate aldermen will effectively mean that he can destabilise a democratically elected MCD because these aldermen get appointed to the standing committees and have voting power.\n\nEarlier, the top court had questioned the \"source of power\" of the LG under the Constitution and the law to nominate aldermen to the MCD without the aid and advice of the elected government.\n\nOn May 12 last year, the top court observed that LG has to act on the \"aid and advice\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government in nominating 10 aldermen to the MCD.

The judgment stated, \"As it was a statutory power and not an executive power, LG was expected to act as per the statutory mandate and not as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers of the Delhi Government.\"\n\nThe judgment passed by the bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices Narasimha and JB Pardiwala stated, \"As it was a statutory power and not an executive power, LG was expected to act as per the statutory mandate and not as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers of the Delhi Government.\"\n\nThe verdict of the top court came on a plea of the Delhi government challenging the nominations of 10 aldermen by LG to MCD. Last year in May, the apex court had said that giving LG the power to nominate aldermen to MCD would mean that he could destabilise an elected civic body. It had reserved the judgment in the case. MCD has 250 elected and 10 nominated members.\n\nIn December 2022, the AAP defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in MCD elections, ending the saffron party's 15-year rule. AAP won 134 seats, BJP 104 and the Congress nine.\n\nThe AAP government informed the apex court that the nominations had been made in the ward committees of MCD where BJP was weak.\n\nThe counsel appearing for LG had contended that the \"aid and advice\" of the Delhi government was not necessary while exercising a statutory power which was specifically conferred on the administrator.\n\nAfter AAP won the municipal elections, LG appointed 10 aldermen that were opposed by the Delhi government.\n\nThe petition by the Delhi government had sought the quashing of the order dated January 3 and 4, 2023, whereby LG had nominated 10 persons as nominated members of the MCD.\n\nLG has \"illegally\" appointed 10 nominated members to MCD on his own initiative and not on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, the plea had stated.\n\nThis is the first time since Article 239AA came into effect in 1991 that such a nomination has been made by LG completely by-passing the elected government, thereby arrogating to an unelected office a power that belongs to the duly elected government, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government had said. Article 239AA establishes special provisions for the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT).\n\nThe government had sought direction \"to nominate members to MCD under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\" The Section gives LG the power to nominate 10 people with special knowledge to the civic body.\n\n\"It is pertinent to note that neither the section nor any other provision of law says anywhere that such nomination is to be made by the Administrator in his discretion.

Source : PTI\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday held that the Delhi LG VK Saxena did not need Aam Aadmi Party-led city city government's approval to appoint aldermen to the Delhi Municipal Corporation.\n\nThe top court today pronounced verdict after reserving it for nearly 15 months in this case. The petition filed by the Delhi Government was heard by a three judge bench led by CJI Chandrachud.\n\nThe top court today held that the power was a statutory power flowing the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and hence the Governor need not act as per the aid and advice of the Delhi Government. Since it was a statutory power and not an executive power, the LG was expected to act as per the statutory mandate and not as per the aid and advice of the Delhi Government.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government had submitted in the top court that Delhi LG nominated aldermen without their consent which was a practice not seen after 1991 when Article 239AA of the Constitution. Delhi government contended that just like the President appoints members to Parliament on nominations received by Council of Ministers, Delhi LG has to act on advice of Delhi ministers while nominating members. And Delhi LG by his act of nominating members to MCD has bypassed the democratically elected government.\n\nThe government further contended that Delhi LG VK Saxena should have either accepted the proposed names recommended to him for nomination by the elected government or differ with the proposal and refer it to the President.\n\nWhile hearing arguments, CJI Chandrachud had orally remarked that the nomination of aldermen by the LG could destabilise the democratic functioning of the MCD.\n\nAs the verdict was pending for nearly 15 months, the MCD could not form the standing committee as the ten nominated aldermen are part of the body which elects this committee.\n\nLast week, MCD Mayor Shelly Oberoi in a fresh petition had flagged concern that MCD's functioning has come to a halt as a result, and urged the top court to allow the MCD Corporation to perform the functions of the standing committee for the time being. The top court however asked Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Delhi government to wait as the verdict will be out soon.\n\nThe MCD has 250 elected and 10 nominated members. In December 2022, the AAP defeated the BJP in MCD elections, winning 134 wards and ending the saffron party's 15-year run at the helm of civic body. The BJP won 104 seats and the Congress bagged nine seats.\n\nThe verdict comes in at a crucial time as the Delhi High Court recently slammed MCD over mis-management and chaos in city while hearing case of deaths of three UPSC students in a flooded Library in a coaching centre's basement", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nupur_dogra@news.abplive.com", "name": "Nupur Dogra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_Oberoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelly Oberoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/02/0442024c7e035c20bc574c5dcd9f29701722620479708426_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790353", "eventUri": "eng-9790353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The tussle often reaches the Supreme Court. Now, in a fresh setback for the AAP, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Lieutenant Governor can nominate aldermen in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without the Delhi government's advice. The apex court bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha and Justice JB Pardiwala noted that the LG's power to nominate members to the MCD is a statutory power and not an executive power.\n\nPronouncing the verdict, Justice Narasimha said Section 3(3)(b) of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act lays down that the Lieutenant Governor can nominate 10 persons not less than 25 years of age. The nominated person should have special knowledge or experience in municipal administration.\n\nThe judge noted that the power in Delhi LG was a semantic lottery. \"It is a law made by the Parliament, it satisfies the discretion exercised by LG since law requires him to do so and falls under the exception of Article 239. It was 1993 DMC Act which first vested the power to nominate on LG and it is not a relic of the past,\" said the justice.\n\nThe judge said that Parliament has conferred LG with power to nominate 10 aldermen and the Delhi Government by AAP cannot quarrel with that.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) consists of 250 elected members and 10 nominated members. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) currently governs the MCD after securing 134 seats in the 2022 elections, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 104 seats. Last year, the Supreme Court indicated that allowing the Lieutenant Governor to nominate aldermen to the MCD could potentially destabilize the elected municipal body.\n\nThe AAP reacted sharply to the verdict. \"I think this is a very big blow to Indian democracy and by bypassing the elected government, you are giving all the rights to LG. I think this is not good for democracy and the Constitution of India. I want to say with due respect that we completely disagree with this decision. This decision is against the spirit of democracy and it is completely opposite to the comments of the court during the hearing,\" said AAP MP Sanjay Singh, that the party will decide the next course of action after reading the full order.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

In May 2023, the apex court had reserved the judgement.\n\nAAP government apex court that the nominations had been made in the ward committees of the MCD where the BJP was weak.\n\nCounsel appearing for LG had contended that \"aid and advice\" of the Delhi government was not necessary while exercising a statutory power which was specifically conferred on the Administrator.\n\nAfter AAP won the municipal elections, the LG appointed 10 'aldermen' that were opposed by Delhi government.\n\nThe petition of the Delhi government had sought quashing of order dated January 3 and 4, 2023 whereby the LG nominated 10 persons as nominated members of the MCD.\n\nLieutenant Governor has \"illegally\"appointed 10 nominated members to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on his own initiative, and not on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, the plea had stated.\n\nThis is the first time since Article 239AA came into effect in 1991 that such a nomination has been made by the LG completely by-passing the elected government, thereby arrogating to an unelected office a power that belongs to the duly elected government, Arvind Kejriwal led Delhi government had said.\n\nIt had sought direction \"to nominate members to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\"\n\n\"It is pertinent to note that neither the section nor any other provision of law says anywhere that such nomination is to be made by the Administrator in his discretion.

It was not open to him at all to make nominations on his own initiative, completely circumventing the elected government. As such, the nominations made by the Lieutenant Governor are ultra vires and illegal, and are consequently liable to be quashed,\" the plea had added.

The bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha and Justice JB Pardiwala had reserved its verdict in the matter last year. The Supreme Court's website earlier said Justice Narasimha will be pronouncing the verdict.\n\nJustice Narasimha said Section 3(3)(b) of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act lays down that the Lieutenant Governor can nominate 10 persons not less than 25 years of age and with special knowledge or experience in municipal administration.\n\n\"It is incorrect to suggest that power in Delhi LG was a semantic lottery. It is law made by the Parliament, it satisfies the discretion exercised by LG since law requires him to do so and falls under the exception of Article 239. It was 1993 DMC Act which first vested the power to nominate on LG and it is not a relic of the past,\" he said.\n\nThe judge also said that a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court has earlier ruled that Parliament can legislate on state and concurrent lists of Delhi. \"As Parliament has conferred power on LG to nominate 10 aldermen, AAP government cannot quarrel with that,\" he said.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi has 250 elected and 10 nominated members. Currently, the ruling AAP controls it after winning 134 seats in the 2022 polls. The BJP holds 104 seats.\n\nThe Supreme Court had said last year that giving the Lieutenant Governor the power to nominate aldermen to MCD will mean he can destabilise an elected civic body.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, the Delhi government's counsel, had contended that the state government has been given no separate powers to nominate people to MCD. A practice of the Lieutenant Governor nominating aldermen on the aid and advice of the city government has been followed for three decades now, he had said.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Lieutenant Governor's office, had argued that just because a practice has been followed for 30 years does not mean it is correct.\n\nThe AAP has described the Supreme Court verdict as a \"jolt to democracy\". \"You are going to bypass an elected government and give all powers to the Lieutenant Governor so that he runs Delhi using a stick. This is not right for democracy. We respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court ruling.

In other states, the governor approves names of nominated councillors but on the aid and advice of the elected government,\" Singh said.\n\nThe MCD has 250 elected and 10 nominated members.\n\nIn December 2022, the AAP defeated the BJP in the MCD elections, ending the saffron party's 15-year rule.

It was not open to him at all to make nominations on his own initiative, completely circumventing the elected government. As such, the nominations made by the Lieutenant Governor are ultra vires and illegal, and are consequently liable to be quashed,\" the plea had added.

The Act mandates the Administrator (Lt Governor) to appoint people with special knowledge or experience in municipal administration to assist the MCD in taking decisions of public importance.\n\nThe appointments came days after the December 2022 MCD polls, in which the AAP defeated the BJP - which had been ruling the MCD for 15 years - winning 134 seats as against the BJP's 104 in the 250-member MCD House.\n\nA major row erupted between the AAP led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the BJP, which rules the Centre, after all 10 members nominated by L-G Saxena turned out to be BJP members with the AAP leaders accusing the BJP of allegedly trying to control the MCD without securing a majority. The AAP subsequently challenged the aldermen's appointments in the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If BJP manages to get a majority in the (MCD's) Standing Committee, which effectively makes all big decisions of the Corporation, by this illegal act of the Lt Governor, it would be an attack on democracy. It is not about 10 aldermen, but about the will of the people,\" a senior AAP leader said.\n\nThough aldermen do not have voting rights in the House meetings or the Mayoral polls, they play a key role in electing the members of the Standing Committee - the body that controls the MCD's purse strings for any project worth over Rs 5 crore - by virtue of being members of the 12 ward committees. Their role has become more crucial in the present House, given the slender majority the AAP has in the MCD.\n\nFor about one-and-a-half years the MCD has been functioning without this crucial body, even as the AAP and the BJP continue to blame each other for Delhi's \"poor\" civic amenities and infrastructure. The MCD came under fire recently after three UPSC aspirants drowned in the basement of a coaching centre in Old Rajinder Nagar.\n\nThe BJP leaders, on the other hand, blame the AAP for not constituting the Standing Committee and say that the appointment of aldermen does not directly affect the constitution of the panel as claimed by the AAP.\n\nThe BJP has also accused the AAP of allegedly stalling governance in the MCD for political gains.\n\nBefore reserving its verdict in the case, the apex court had observed that \"giving this power (to appoint aldermen) to the Lt Governor would effectively mean that he can destabilise democratically elected Municipal Committees because they (aldermen) will have voting powers also\".\n\nThe top court's ruling on Monday holds great significance for both the AAP and the BJP as it would determine how the corporation is going to run in the future.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mallica_joshi@indianexpress.com", "name": "Mallica Joshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Associated_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/cats_d06574.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790353", "eventUri": "eng-9790353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 160, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But in 2022 MCD elections were held. Aam Aadmi Party won in 134 divisions in this election. That means it has won more than half of the seats. With this, the reins of the Delhi Municipal Corporation went into the hands of the Aam Aadmi Party. With that, it was like singing the final song to the BJP, which has been in power in MCD for 15 years. In this election, BJP won 104 seats and Congress won 9 seats.\n\nClick Here To Join Us On WhatsApp\n\nAt the same time, 10 members were nominated to the MCD by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. The Kejriwal government is not very fond of this affair. The Kejriwal government filed a plea in the Supreme Court saying that the Lieutenant Governor did not have the authority to nominate 10 members of the Delhi Municipal Corporation, After almost 15 months, the Supreme Court examined Kejriwal's PIL on August 5th and announced its verdict as above.

The inadequate management has been linked to the tragic deaths due to the drowning of three civil services aspirants in the basement of a coaching centre in Old Rajendra Nagar, further intensifying scrutiny of the MCD's operations.

The control over the 18-member standing committee, which controls MCD's purse strings, will now be the next battle between AAP and BJP.\n\nThe MCD election was held in December 2022. But the civic body's deliberative wing has remained incomplete in the absence of key panels over the logjam due to the dispute over the aldermen. The logjam meant that all major projects were stuck.\n\nMCD functionaries said the court verdict will pave the way for elections for wards committee or 12 decentralised panels to oversee each administrative zone in Delhi and subsequently the standing committee.\n\nOrigin of the dispute\n\nThe last civic polls were held following the unification of three erstwhile corporations in May 2022 for better administration. AAP won the polls securing a simple majority of 134 out of 250 seats. In January 2023, LG VK Saxena nominated 10 aldermen. The AAP moved the Supreme Court over the nominations, saying they were made without consulting the government. It argued such nominations were earlier made following the aid and advice of the government.\n\nThe MCD Act says the administrator, or the LG, has the right to nominate the 10 aldermen. The AAP and BJP have been at loggerheads over securing these posts.\n\nAlderman is a titular position with origins in the old municipal governance structure of boroughs and county councils in Britain. Aldermen have no direct voting rights in the House of MCD councillors. Their right to vote in the wards committee could help alter the power balance in other committees under the MCD. The AAP has a majority in the House. But the zonal distribution of BJP and AAP councillors leaves the control over the standing committee an open contest.\n\nImportance of control over the standing committee\n\nAll the policy proposals and the budget are presented first to the 18-member panel. Only after its approval, they are sent to the House of councillors. An MCD official said that the panel clears the sanctions of all projects worth above \u20b9five crore, policy matters with financial implications on the civic body as well as the layout plans of all major projects.\n\nOut of the 18 members, six are elected directly. MCD's 12 zonal wards committees of the 12 administrative zones elect the rest of the 12 members. After all the 18 members are finalised, one of them is elected as the standing committee chairman through elections. The chairman's position is important and rivals the powers of the mayor.\n\nFormer MCD chief law officer Anil Gupta said the aldermen do not have voting rights in the House meetings as per the 2015 Onika Malhotra high court order. He added aldermen have voting rights in the zonal committees and therefore they may help the political parties to tip the balance.\n\nThe AAP alleged that 10 members from the BJP background were nominated and said this was against the people's verdict in the MCD elections.\n\nImpact of logjam\n\nIn the absence of the key panel, a series of projects and policy decisions have remained stuck over the last 20 months. An MCD official pointed out that only the standing committee can clear the layout plans of major infrastructure projects. Over 60 such projects were stuck in the town planning department in the absence of this key panel. \"The pending projects include the one for appointing new companies for clearing the landfill sites...new operators need to be hired for bio mining of legacy waste. We are also unable to appoint a new operator for collection of toll tax in the Capital...the contract of the previous operator ended on April 10,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.\n\nA second MCD official explained that the commissioner has the power to clear projects up to \u20b95 crore. But larger projects need the standing committee's approval along with layout plan approval for projects like the new Delhi Transport Corporation township in Hari Nagar, hostel towers for Delhi University, IIFT Maidangarhi and another multi-storey tower on DDU Marg.\n\n\"We are also undertaking the process for layout plans of three colonies which would serve as a model for regularisation of unauthorised colonies but this will also need the approval of the standing committee,\" said the second official.\n\nThe AAP-led MCD House of councillors passed a resolution on January 15 saying that approvals for contracts with expenditures greater than \u20b95 crore, including cases where approvals are routed through the Standing Committee, be given by the corporation.\n\nIn the absence of the key panel, MCD was forced to provide extensions to private operators in multiple cases including the contract to manage garbage in the central zone which covers VIP pockets in New Delhi. The corporation has been unable to hire a a private operator for Delhi's first pet park in Jangpura and set up the Shahjahnabad Museum and Interpretation Centre near Lahori Gate among other projects\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe Supreme Court verdict will intensify the battle for control over the standing committee. Gupta said that the municipal secretariat will now hold elections for the wards committees, each of which will elect a chairman, deputy chairman, and a standing committee member. \"One of the six directly elected standing committee members, Kamaljeet Sehrawat, has resigned after being elected West Delhi member of Parliament. Therefore, a direct election for the vacant post will be held. Together all these 18 members will elect the chairman. The entire process may take 1-1.5 months given that time for nominations has to be provided.\"\n\nMCD oversees an area of 1397.3 square kilometers sub-divided into 12 administrative zones. Based on the distribution of councillors, the BJP has an advantage in Shahdara, Shahdara South, Najafgarh, and Keshavpuram zones. AAP has an advantage in five zones.\n\nPolitical slugfest\n\nAAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh said all the rights were being given to LG bypassing the government. \"This is not good for democracy and the Constitution. We respectfully disagree with the decision,\" he said. \"This decision is completely different from the comments of the Chief Justice or other judges during the hearing in this case.\"\n\nSingh said that in other states, the governor approves the names of nominated councillors and council members on the recommendation of the government. \"Why is it not so in Delhi? Is there no elected government here? This is a decision against the people and the spirit of democracy... After reading the entire decision, we will make a strategy as to what to do next... We will win the elections of the standing committee.\"\n\nDelhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said that AAP opposes LG's decisions. \"Delhi cannot be compared to other states. Delhi is a centrally administered area. The Supreme Court decision has exposed them. We are disappointed with Singh's statement which raises questions on the verdict. Even though they are aware of the jurisdictions in Delhi, AAP misleads people by blaming LG. The decision by LG was according to the Constitution.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The bench, comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha, and Justice JB Pardiwala, delivered the verdict that had been reserved since last year.\n\nJustice Narasimha stated that Section 3(3)(b) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act authorizes the LG to nominate 10 individuals, aged 25 or above, with special knowledge or experience in municipal administration.\n\n\"It is incorrect to suggest that the power vested in the Delhi LG is a mere semantic lottery. It is a law made by Parliament, satisfying the discretion exercised by the LG as required by the law and falling under the exception of Article 239. The 1993 DMC Act first vested the power to nominate in the LG, and it is not a relic of the past,\" Justice Narasimha said.\n\nThe judge also pointed out that a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court had previously ruled that Parliament could legislate on state and concurrent lists of Delhi. \"As Parliament has conferred power on the LG to nominate 10 aldermen, the AAP government cannot quarrel with that,\" he added.\n\nThe MCD comprises 250 elected and 10 nominated members. The AAP currently controls the MCD after winning 134 seats in the 2022 elections, while the BJP holds 104 seats.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court expressed concerns that granting the LG the power to nominate aldermen could destabilize an elected civic body. Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, argued that the state government had no separate powers to nominate people to the MCD and that the practice of the LG nominating aldermen based on the city government's aid and advice had been followed for three decades.\n\nHowever, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the LG's office, countered that a long-standing practice does not necessarily mean it is correct.\n\nThe AAP described the Supreme Court verdict as a \"jolt to democracy.\" Party MP Sanjay Singh stated, \"You are going to bypass an elected government and give all powers to the Lieutenant Governor so that he runs Delhi using a stick. This is not right for democracy. We respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court ruling. The verdict is at odds with the bench's observations during the hearing.\" He added that the party would decide on the next steps after reviewing the judgment.\n\nThe AAP government, led by Arvind Kejriwal, has long argued that the Centre maintains a stranglehold on Delhi through the LG, restricting the elected city government's ability to execute its duties properly.\n\nConversely, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal welcomed the Supreme Court verdict, stating that it clarified the LG's authority to appoint aldermen as per the law. \"The Aam Aadmi Party has a habit of making allegations on every issue. Their politics has been rejected by the court,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged on Sunday to bring back a form of national service for the first time in more than 60 years, seeking to energise his election campaign after a faltering start. The UK introduced military conscription for men and some women during World War II, and imposed 18 months of mandatory military service for men between 1947 and 1960. Since then Britain has had an all-volunteer military whose size has steadily shrunk.

The rest would spend one weekend a month working for charities, community groups, or organisations such as hospitals, the police and the fire service. Sunak said the program would help \"create a shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country\". It remains unclear how it will be made compulsory. Home Secretary James Cleverly said no one would be forced to serve in the military. Cleverly said Sunday that the main goal of the new plan was not boosting the military but building \"a society where people mix with people outside their own communities, mix with people from different backgrounds, different religions, different income levels.\" The Conservatives estimated the cost of the national service plan at \u00a32.5 billion ($4.7 billion) a year. They said it would be paid for partly by taking \u00a31.5 billion ($2.9 billion) from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which was set up in 2022 to regenerate poor communities.

Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the Tory plan amounted to \"compulsory volunteering\" and predicted \"it'll never happen\". Elections in the UK have to be held no more than five years apart. The prime minister can choose the timing within that period and Sunak, 44, had until December to name the date. He took most people \u2013 including those in his own party \u2013 by surprise when he announced on Wednesday that the election would be held on July 4.

Sunak's election announcement outside 10 Downing Street saw him drenched with rain and drowned out by protesters blasting a Labour campaign song.

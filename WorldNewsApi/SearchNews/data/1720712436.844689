Emergency services were called to Brockwell Park in south London at around 6.20pm on Saturday after the ride 'ripped apart', catapulting a carriage into the crowd. Among those injured included an 11-year-old girl, a man in his 50s and a man and woman both in their 40s. The London Ambulance Service said the injured were all taken to major trauma centres. Lambeth Council has confirmed the second day of the Lambeth Country Show is going ahead as planned amid an investigation into the horror incident yesterday. But fairground rides were not open when the show kicked off at 1pm. Kareen Swaby, 41, had gone to the event for 'just a nice family day out' with her loved ones before things took a terrifying turn. She witnessed the shocking incident and told MailOnline how she saw the carriage 'come off its hinges', injuring a man standing next to her on the head. Ms Swaby said: 'Blood was pouring from his head. He got back up and he just collapsed again. At this time, I didn't know if he was conscious or not.' The woman described how as the situation unfolded, she heard a 'little girl screaming at the top of her lungs'. The Metropolitan Police confirmed 'enquiries are under way to establish the circumstances' and that 'the Health and Safety Executive will be informed'. New witness accounts described the situation. One woman said: 'I have never seen anything like it in my life. I feel sick thinking about it. Four people basically flew through the air off the ride. 'It was dreadful. I will never forget it. The screams from them and everybody was dreadful. 'How on earth could it happen? 'I am shocked to see the event itself has reopened. I am very glad the fair has been closed.' A spokesperson for Lambeth Council said this morning: 'Very sadly a funfair ride at the country show malfunctioned yesterday evening (June 8) injuring four people. They are being cared for in hospital and our thoughts are with them. An investigation into the incident, led by the Met Police and Health and Safety Executive, is underway. 'We thank the emergency services for their swift response at the country show yesterday and for the support they are providing to the affected families. 'Following this incident, and to allow a full investigation, funfair rides at the show will be impacted by closures for the second day of the country show. 'The safety and well-being of our attendees remains our top priority, and we are committed to providing a secure and enjoyable experience for all visitors.", "summary": "Emergency services were called to Brockwell Park in south London at around 6.20pm on Saturday after the ride 'ripped apart' , catapulting a carriage into the crowd.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13510867/Fairground-Brockwell-Park-Lambeth-Country-reopens-four-people-hospital-ride.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/15/85897941-0-image-a-62_1717942449453.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:39:26", "author": "Adela Whittingham,Editor,Emily Cooper", "authors": ["Adela Whittingham", "Editor", "Emily Cooper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.308}

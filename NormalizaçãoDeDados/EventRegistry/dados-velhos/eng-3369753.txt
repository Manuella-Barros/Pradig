Kemar Roach is actually showing some very, very good form - so I'm really confident in our bowling.\"\n\nHolder added that hosts England would come \"pretty hard\" and he wants his side to go back at them in the same way. \"I don't think there's anything to spark that,\" said Holder. \"But we expect a good contest ... the English come pretty hard, and we expect to go back just as hard at them,\" insisted the skipper. \"We're obviously huge underdogs. We've got guys who are showing signs they can compete at Test level,\" he said.\n\nTalking about England, Holder suggested that they would be looking to create some extra pressure on the hosts to get some fruitful results.\n\n\"I think for us, it's mainly just to make it as uncomfortable as possible for their senior players ... and put some pressure on the junior guys who are coming in to make their mark,\" said Holder.\n\nMentioning about the struggle that the West Indies batsmen have been facing, the Caribbean team slipper admitted that the batsmen need to chip in with some runs in order to produce some good results.\n\n\"It's just for our batsmen to make some runs,\" said Holder. \"We've struggled in the past, primarily with our batting, but so far on this tour we've been doing really well,\" added the captain.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: West Indies tour of England 2017", "id": "9632822", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "We are the underdogs in Test series against England, says Jason Holder", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/jason-holder-m.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 33, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303251", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "id": "309560", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground"}, "id": "312849", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgbaston_Cricket_Ground"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}, "id": "312851", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}, "id": "348129", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shannon Gabriel"}, "id": "464418", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Gabriel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joel Garner"}, "id": "548940", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Garner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kemar Roach"}, "id": "557340", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemar_Roach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Day/night cricket"}, "id": "710741", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day/night_cricket"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 165, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Machinery and Tools", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Machinery_and_Tools"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 272, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Materials", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Materials"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 297, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 522, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 546, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 852, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1279, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Calibration and Testing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Calibration_and_Testing"}], "time": "07:30:00"}

had already announced the one change to their side for this first of a three-Test series, with Surrey batsman Mark Stoneman given an England debut in the problem position of opener.\n\nStoneman replaced the dropped Keaton Jennings, a former team-mate at Durham, in the lone alteration to the team that beat South Africa by 177 runs in the fourth Test at Old Trafford earlier this month to complete a 3-1 series win.\n\nWest Indies left out experienced fast bowler Shannon Gabriel, who had no-ball problems in last week's floodlit warm-up match against Derbyshire and was not yet deemed to have regained full fitness following an injury lay-off.\n\nThere was no place either for leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo, who took a career-best eight for 49 against Pakistan in the West Indies' inaugural floodlit Test in Dubai in October.\n\nMiguel Cummins came in to a pace attack also featuring Kemar Roach, Alzarri Joseph and captain Jason Holder.\n\nThe West Indies also gave a debut to Kyle Hope, now playing in the same side as brother and fellow batsman Shai Hope.\n\nThe West Indies have not won a Test in England since a victory at Edgbaston in 2000.\n\nThursday's match is the 50th Test

Indies\n\nThe hosts had already announced the one change to their side for this first of a three-test series, with Surrey batsman Mark Stoneman given an England debut in the problem position of opener.\n\nStoneman replaced the dropped Keaton Jennings, a former teammate at Durham, in the lone alteration to the team that beat South Africa by 177 runs in the fourth test at Old Trafford earlier this month to complete a 3-1 series win.\n\nWest Indies left out experienced fast bowler Shannon Gabriel, who had no-ball problems in last week's floodlit warm-up match against Derbyshire and was not yet deemed to have regained full fitness following an injury lay-off.\n\nThere was no place either for legspinner Devendra Bishoo, who took a career-best eight for 49 against Pakistan in the West Indies' inaugural floodlit test in Dubai in October.\n\nMiguel Cummins came in to a pace attack also featuring Kemar Roach, Alzarri Joseph and captain Jason Holder.\n\nThe West Indies also gave a debut to Kyle Hope, now playing in the same side as brother and fellow batsman Shai Hope.\n\nThe West Indies have not won a test in England since a victory at Edgbaston in 2000.\n\nThursday's match is the 50th test staged at Edgbaston, the Birmingham headquarters of Midlands county Warwickshire.\n\nENGLAND: Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (capt), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny

English cricket is about to enter the Test Twilight Zone, where strange things can happen. At Adelaide Oval in 2015, the highest score between Australia and New Zealand was 224 and the Test was over inside three days; in Dubai last year, West Indies' first taste of day-night Tests, Azhar Ali scored the first pink-ball triple-hundred; a few weeks later, again in Adelaide, Faf du Plessis declared South Africa's first innings during the final session of the opening day. More fantastical still, Pakistan came within 40 runs of chasing 490 to beat Australia at the Gabba in December 2016.\n\nSo what will Edgbaston serve up for England's first experience of this eye-catching format tweak? Stuart Broad articulated the uncertainties for the home side when he described it as a step into the unknown and while West Indies are unlikely to talk up their chances too much, they will have the edge in understanding how the pink ball will play. In their last warm-up match, against Derbyshire, they had four batsmen score hundreds whilst bowling out the opposition cheaply - although Shannon Gabriel's problem with overstepping was a cause for concern.\n\nEngland should come into the game high on confidence, having just defeated South Africa 3-1, but there ought to be no room for complacency - and not only because of the pink pill. Mark Stoneman, the Surrey opener, will make his debut as England's search for a long-term opening partner for Alastair Cook continues, and that is just one of three or four positions that Joe Root will want nailed to the table before setting off for an Ashes defence this winter. This will be a big series for the likes of Tom Westley, Dawid Malan and Toby Roland-Jones, too.\n\nRoot will also know not to underestimate West Indies on the basis of their last encounter, when they held England to a 1-1 draw in the Caribbean after being talked down as \"mediocre\" opposition in the build-up. Jason Holder, West Indies' captain, set the tone with a match-saving hundred in Antigua and then he and his fellow quicks helped bowl them to a series-levelling victory in Bridgetown. Jerome Taylor has since retired but Kemar Roach is back, after 18 months out of the Test side, and the tourists have a pace battery to keep England on their toes. Edgbaston under floodlights might help to put them in the pink.\n\nThe wider context, of course, encompasses the future of the Test game. Ticket sales have been healthy and the Birmingham public seems ready to embrace the concept (or at least give it a whirl). Will they get an Edgbaston classic? Well, stranger things have happened.\n\nHe has been a model of consistency on the county circuit and, a few weeks after his 30th birthday, Mark Stoneman is finally set for his England opportunity. An average of just under 35 might not signal a great talent waiting to be unleashed but that is more reflective of his tough grounding on the spicy northern tracks of Chester-le-Street, where he learned his trade for Durham. His move to Surrey saw him add a career-best 197 earlier this season and last week he completed 1000 first-class runs for the fifth season running. A good series will in all likelihood see him opening at Brisbane for the start of the 2017-18 Ashes.\n\nWhether West Indies' top seven can make enough runs to put England under pressure will be a key factor of the series, but the return of Kemar Roach could give them an edge with the ball. He may no longer be the bruising quick who discomforted Ricky Ponting and gave Jonny Bairstow a working over on debut but his form in domestic cricket suggests his has the nous to adapt; seven wickets at a cost of just 74 in two tour matches offers further encouragement that he will be a handful. Roach is by far the most experienced member of the attack and West Indies fans will fervently hope the fire still burns.\n\nEngland will make just one change from the side that overcame South Africa at The Oval and Old Trafford, with Stoneman coming in for Keaton Jennings as Cook's 12th opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss.\n\nEngland 1 Alastair Cook, 2 Mark Stoneman, 3 Tom Westley, 4 Joe Root (capt), 5 Dawid Malan, 6 Ben Stokes, 7 Jonny Bairstow (wk), 8 Moeen Ali, 9 Toby Roland-Jones, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson\n\nKyle Hope is in line for a debut, coming in at No. 3 above his younger brother, Shai. Both scored hundreds in the pink-ball warm-up match at Derby, as did Roston Chase and opener Kieran Powell. Gabriel struggled with his with his run-up in that match, bowling 24 no-balls in all, but is expected to play, with the final choice between Devendra Bishoo's legspin or a fourth seamer in Alzarri Joseph.\n\nWest Indies (probable) 1 Kraigg Brathwaite, 2 Kieran Powell, 3 Kyle Hope, 4 Shai Hope, 5 Roston Chase, 6 Jermaine Blackwood, 7 Shane Dowrich (wk), 8 Jason Holder (capt), 9 Devendra Bishoo/Alzarri Joseph, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Shannon Gabriel\n\nThe surface being used is one over from the pitch that Australia were bowled out for 136 on in 2015. It is expected to offer some life for the seamers but may not break up much. The forecast is generally clear for the five days but it could be a little chilly for those in the stands come the evening.\n\n\"Of course you want a settled side. You never want to go into a series with guys out of form or under pressure. But that's one of the challenges of Test cricket.''\n\nJoe Root on the merry-go-round of England selection", "id": "9515452", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "England gears up for

Further, the Windies have not won a Test here in 17 years and are also without a series win in nearly three decades, since the incomparable Sir Vivian Richards presided over a 3-1 victory in 1988. Captain Jason Holder, on his first tour of England since taking over the helm of the side two years ago, told reporters yesterday that despite being underdogs, he had been boosted by his side's form in the recent first class tour matches.\n\n\"For us, we've just been focussing on ourselves primarily and trying to nail down our processes, and I think we have been doing that in the warm-up games so far, so we only hope that can transcend into the Test series.\" West Indies have showed signs of form in the tour matches, with four batsmen - Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase and Kieran Powell - all getting hundreds in the drawn game against Derbyshire last week.\n\nChase, in particular, has been outstanding with scores over fifty in his four innings on tour while Jermaine Blackwood has also been among the runs. Seamer Kemar Roach, on his first Test tour in nearly two years following a spell on the sidelines due to injury and loss of form, started the tour with a five-wicket haul against Essex while rookie 20-year-old speedster Alzarri Joseph shone with a four-wicket haul against Kent.\n\nPacer Holder, who bowled well in the Derbyshire day/night game, said it was important the Windies brought all the facets of their game together, especially since they would be playing under lights with the pink ball. \"I think our bowling has really carried us throughout the last few Test matches. We've got people like Shannon Gabriel who has had a pretty decent year, myself I haven't been doing to badly,\" he pointed.\n\n\"We've got Miguel Cummins, young Alzarri Joseph - Kemar Roach is actually showing some very, very good form so I'm really confident in our bowling. The Windies enter the series with a less than stellar recent record, with just three wins in their last 23 Tests and without a Test series win in three years.\n\nIn fact, the last time West Indies beat a side ranked higher was in 2012 when they secured a 2-0 series win over New Zealand in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Test, the first to be played with the pink ball in England, bowls off at 2 pm (9 am Eastern Caribbean time).

West Indies already have some experience with the pink ball as they faced Pakistan in United Arab Emirates in October last year.\n\nThe West Indies have managed to beat England in just one game out of the last 12 Tests and that victory came in May 2015 against Alastair Cook's men.\n\nEngland has a formidable record at home as they lost just two series since 2009.\n\nWest Indies head into today's game having won just two of the last 17 Tests as compared to England, who won five out of the last seven games at home.\n\nAlastair Cook is on the verge of becoming the leading run-scorer in England and Wales as he requires another 98 runs to go past Graham Gooch, who had 5917 runs. The former England captain is also just 155 runs away to become the leading run-getter at Edgbaston.\n\nCook also enjoys playing against West Indies as he averages 57.4 in the last 30 innings against the Caribbean team.\n\nStuart Broad needs another five wickets to go past Ian Botham and become the second-leading wicket-taker for England behind James Anderson.\n\nMeanwhile, Anderson needs another five scalps to surpass Fred Trueman's record of 39 to become the leading wicket-taker at Edgbaston.\n\nEngland's squad for the first Test reads: Joe Root (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wicketkeeper), Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Toby Roland-Jones, Ben Stokes, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley and Chris Woakes.\n\nFor the West Indies, skipper Jason Holder is 17 runs short of reaching 1,000 runs in Test cricket ansfast bowler Kemar Roach has been recalled. The 29-year-old last featured for West Indies in January 2016 during the away series in Australia but a dip in form led to his exclusion from the side.\n\nUncapped batsman Kyle Hope and all-rounder RaymonReifer have also been called up to the squad with Vishaul Singh, who was part of the home series against Pakistan, missing out.\n\nHope had a promising start to his limited overs career against India where he scored 100 runs from three One-Day Internationals while Reifer is coming at the back of a strong performance for Guyana in the Professional Cricket League Regional tournament.\n\nWest Indies' squad for the first Test reads: Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Braithwaite (vice-captain), DevendraBishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel,

The first of a three-match campaign gets underway at Edgbaston on Thursday with the inaugural day/night Test ever staged in England.\n\nMuch of the pre-match build-up has focused on how Joe Root's men will cope with their first tasted of pink ball international cricket. Also, given this is England's last Test series before they tour Australia, there has been much speculation as to what the composition of this side could mean in terms of their Ashes defence 'Down Under'.\n\nThat England, fresh from a 3-1 home success against South Africa, will win their series against the West Indies is almost taken as read, something unthinkable when the men from the Caribbean were dominating Test cricket in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet a sign of how far the West Indies have slipped from those heights is that they have gone 17 matches without a Test win in England, losing 14 and drawing the other three.\n\nAlthough an end now appears in sight to a bitter dispute between players and officials, the West Indies have still arrived in England without several star names for a series that is, to the dismay of traditionalists, taking place at the same time as the lucrative Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 competition.\n\nYet the West Indies did draw their last Test series against England in the Caribbean two years ago -- despite being labelled a \"mediocre\" side by England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves. Jason Holder, the captain for that series, is still the West Indies skipper and Law is confident the all-rounder remains the right man for the job. \"He takes it with a pinch of salt, the things said about him and this team and uses it to drive him and them forward,\" Law told reporters at Edgbaston on Tuesday.\n\n\"It is a lot of responsibility, and he does it with fantastic integrity,\" added former batsman Law, who made just one Test appearance for Australia such was their top-order strength in the 1990s.\n\nLaw knows English cricket well from his successful playing stints with county sides Essex and Lancashire. England may have overwhelmed South Africa but doubts about their top-order batting remain. The Edgbaston Test will see Mark Stoneman become Alastair Cook's 12th England opening partner in the five years since Andrew Strauss retired. Meanwhile Tom Westley and Dawid Malan have yet to nail down their places at numbers three and five respectively.\n\nWest Indies' pace attack, which includes Shannon Gabriel and 20-year-old Alzarri Joseph, could pose problems for an England top order often overly-reliant on Cook and Root.\n\n\"You always look at any little crack you can find,\" said Law. \"With a couple of new guys to the fore in Test cricket, that's an opportunity for our bowlers,\" he added. \"There's been a lot said about this (West Indies) cricket team, and that is motivation for them,\" Law explained. \"We're looking forward -- let's rewrite that history.\" But the West Indies, for all that Shai Hope and Roston Chase scored centuries in a warm-up match against Derbyshire last week, have their own top-order concerns.\n\nFor many of their young batsmen, this will be the first time they have played Test cricket in English conditions. And if that were not enough of a problem, the West Indies will now be facing one of England's greatest new-ball duos in James Anderson and Stuart Broad.\n\nBut Broad, whose father Chris was a member of the England side 'blackwashed' by a brilliant West Indies team in 1984, was taking nothing for granted.\n\n\"We've got a huge amount of respect for the way the West Indies play,\" said Broad, who needs just five more wickets to overtake Ian Botham and go second behind Anderson in England's all-time list of leading Test wicket-takers. \"The West Indies as they are on this England tour are going to be hugely keen to prove themselves,\" he added.\n\nSQUADS:\n\nEngland: Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (capt), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wkt), Moeen Ali, Toby Roland-Jones, Stuart Broad, James Anderson\n\nWest Indies (probable): Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich (wkt), Jason Holder

England are currently ranked No. 3 in the world, they are upbeat after beating South Africa, and are playing in their territory. Up against them is the No. 8 team in the world, a team that has won just two of the 15 Tests they have played in the last two years while losing ten. The Windies squad wears a careworn look, with experience at a premium in all departments.\n\nThe good news for the Jason Holder-led team, though, is that most of their batsmen have been among the runs in the three practice matches they have played so far. All of Kraigg Brathwaite, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood and Shane Dowrich got at least one good score heading into the third game, against Derbyshire, where they upped the ante with Kieran Powell scoring 92 and 100 (retired), and Kyle Hope, Shai Hope and Chase all scoring hundreds in the first innings.\n\nAlong with the batsmen doing well, there was a satisfactory performance from Kemar Roach, the comeback man, who returned a five-for in the first game, against Essex. Roach last played Test cricket in January 2016, and if in rhythm, his contribution could be vital from Windies' point of view in a pace attack that also has Shannon Gabriel, Alzarri Joseph and Miguel Cummins.\n\nTeams (from)\n\nEngland: Joe Root (capt), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Toby Roland-Jones, Ben Stokes, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Chris Woakes.\n\nWindies: Jason Holder (capt), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishooo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich (wk), Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope (wk), Alzarri Joseph, Kieran Powell, Raymon Reifer, Kemar Roach.\n\nNot to forget that despite their mediocre performances on the whole, Windies did draw a three-Test series 1-1 back home in the Caribbean in 2015 against England, the last time they faced off in the longest format.\n\nAs expected, England look strong with Alastair Cook and Joe Root the frontmen at the top of the order, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali the big men in the middle, and a strong bowling attack headlined by James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Toby Roland-Jones, Moeen and Stokes, with backup - and possibly a selection conundrum - in the form of Chris Woakes, who has recovered from injury, and Mason Crane, the highly-rated 20-year-old legspinner.\n\nBut Stuart Law, the Windies coach, had his focus trained on Mark Stoneman, the new opening partner for Cook, as well as Tom Westley and Dawid Malan, both greenhorns in the XI who haven't yet cemented their spots.\n\n\"You always look at any little crack you can find,\" said Law in the lead-up to the game. \"With a couple of new guys to the fore in Test cricket, that's an opportunity for our bowlers.\"\n\nMan for man, and on form, England look far stronger, but there's also the other aspect to the Edgbaston Test - the pink ball. Windies have already played a pink-ball Test, against Pakistan in Dubai last year, which they lost by 56 runs, and also a warm-up game on this tour. Several England players have never encountered the phenomenon.\n\nBroad, who has taken 379 wickets in 106 Tests, has only ever bowled one delivery with a pink ball, and said, \"I just don't know what to expect. We are just going to have to be so adaptable on the day and figure out what's going on.\"\n\nMoeen, who against South Africa became the first man to take 25 wickets in a four-Test series, added, \"It's different ... it feels lighter off the bat. Sometimes you don't feel like you've hit it, and it goes; other times you've nailed it, and it doesn't. But you get used to it ... I did by the end of the (net) session.\"\n\nIt should be interesting if Windies can put up a fight and compete at their best. If not, it could become one-way traffic pretty quickly.", "id": "9470768", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Windies hope to spring pink surprise on England", "image":

England are a very good cricket team. They've played some very good cricket and a number of their players are in good form,\" Holder said.\n\n\"And likewise for us, we've had a pretty decent year so far in Test cricket - we've won one Test game so far and we've lost two. In that last series against Pakistan, I felt there was significant improvement. We had guys who showed progress and improvement and showing signs they can compete here at Test level.\n\n\"For us, we've just been focussing on ourselves primarily and trying to nail down our processes, and I think we have been doing that in the warm-up games so far, so we only hope that can transcend into the Test series.\"\n\nWest Indies have showed signs of form in the tour matches, with four batsmen - Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase and Kieran Powell - all getting hundreds in the drawn game against Derbyshire last week.\n\nChase, in particular, has been outstanding with scores over fifty in his four innings on tour while Jermaine Blackwood has also been among the runs.\n\nSeamer Kemar Roach, on his first Test tour in nearly two years following a spell on the sidelines due to injury and loss of form, started the tour with a five-wicket haul against Essex while rookie 20-year-old speedster Alzarri Joseph shone with a four-wicket haul against Kent.\n\nPacer Holder, who bowled well in the Derbyshire day/night game, said it was important the Windies brought all the facets of their game together, especially since they would be playing under lights with the pink ball.\n\n\"I think our bowling has really carried us throughout the last few Test matches. We've got people like Shannon Gabriel who has had a pretty decent year, myself I haven't been doing to badly,\" he pointed.\n\n\"We've got Miguel Cummins, young Alzarri Joseph - Kemar Roach is actually showing some very, very good form so I'm really confident in our bowling.\n\n\"It's just for our batsmen to make some runs. We've struggled in the past primarily with our batting but so far on this tour we've been doing really well so I'm expecting things from the batsmen.\"\n\nHe added: \"The mood is good. We have two solid weeks of preparation here in England. I felt these three tour games were of good benefit to us. We got a chance to get acclimatised, obviously [we got] a chance to see how the pink ball operates here in England and obviously the red ball so it was a pretty good exercise in the last two weeks.\"\n\nThe Windies enter the series with a less than stellar recent record, with just three wins in their last 23 Tests and without a Test series win in three years.\n\nIn fact, the last time West Indies beat a side ranked higher was in 2012 when they secured a 2-0 series win over New Zealand in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Test, the first to be played with the pink ball in England, bowls off at 9 am Eastern Caribbean time (1400 GMT).\n\nENGLAND - Joe Root (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Dawid Malan, Toby Roland-Jones, Ben Stokes, Mark

Shannon Gabriel has been omitted, after struggling with his run-up at Derby, along with the legspinner Devendra Bishoo.\n\nSevere traffic congestion outside the ground was an early indication of the

He has been either too straight or too wide against Cook and has been picked off quite easily for boundaries. It's been plain sailing for the former England captain but for a one delivery against Joseph which he guided through the slip cordon in the sixth over.\n\nThe pitch is on the slower side and England are already scoring above six runs an over.\n\nSide fact: A host of West Indian greats including Sir Viv Richards, Curtly Ambrose, Gordon Greenidge and co are in attendance.\n\nAnd a pearler knocks Stoneman over\n\nNot much he could have done with that, the debutant. Seams away off a good length to hit top of off! He struggled with his line and length in the first over. Hits the bulls eye first ball of the second. Not the best of balls to get when you're working your way into Test cricket. But that's the best initiation to the big league, one that Roach has been away from for a while as well!\n\nPleasing start for the debutant\n\nTwo half-volleys, one played through covers and others flicked past square gives Stoneman two boundaries in his first over of Test cricket. There is some swing for Kemar Roach with the pink ball, evidenced by a wild delivery that landed in second slip's hands ala Harmison, Brisbane!\n\nAlastair Cook walks out to the middle with Stoneman - his 12th different opening partner (since Strauss's retirement). Jason Holder gets his team in a huddle. Last minute-pep talk. He'll probably want to reiterate what Joel Garner had to say earlier this week.\n\nStoneman Stat\n\nStoneman's debut means more than half (10) of the 18 counties have had a representative open with Cook since Strauss' retirement #ENGvWI -- Ross Lawson (@RossLawson03)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nI think people are writing the West Indies off too early and it could be at their own peril. Cricket is played in the middle at the end of the day,.\n\nMore pre-match reading:\n\nEngland's leap into the unknown, writes Rob Johnston.\n\nDepending on your view, Test cricket may have enough theatre and spectacle as it is without the need for lights and a strangely coloured ball but the day-night initiative is surely worth a try given the very real danger that Test cricket will become marginalised by a combination of T20 cricket and people's increasingly hectic lifestyles.\n\nTeams - No Bishoo, Gabriel for WI\n\nEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root(c), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Toby Roland-Jones, James Anderson\n\nWindies (Playing XI): Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich(w), Jason Holder(c), Kemar Roach, Alzarri Joseph, Miguel Cummins\n\nToss - England elect to bat\n\nOur man, Rob Johnston pings on Twitter that the pitch looks a good one. Joe Root seems to agree as he elects to bat upon winning the toss. Kemar Roach returns to the side for the first times since January 2016. Interestingly, there's no place for Shannon Gabriel in the eleven (this will prompt some debate) as Miguel Cummins gets the nod. Alzarri Joseph is the third quick.\n\nThat's what they're saying...\n\nInteresting build up to the pink ball Test match. Does anyone think this is the future of Test cricket?? -- Eoin Morgan (@Eoin16)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nGet up to speed:\n\nAt Edgbaston, play will start each day at 2pm UK time with a scheduled finish of 9pm with the option of extending play by an hour for lost time or slow over rates. Because the sun sets late in England, the floodlights will be turned on during the tea interval - they have been used earlier elsewhere in the world - unless poor light means they are required before. Unlike during normal Tests in England, the start can be brought forward to 1.30pm to make up time lost to weather.\n\nPrelude - Pink-ball Test\n\nAfter the euphoria of ending the South African hoodoo, England's focus turns to West Indies, or Windies as the team now calls itself. England are now ready to embark on what's slowly becoming a regular feature across the world - the Day-Night Test. It's a format West Indies have already experienced - last year in Dubai against Pakistan.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns - how will the pink-ball behave. More importantly will the Dukes version of the pink-ball pass the big longevity and visibility tests that Kookaburra have slowly worked on?\n\nBut Root and Co. aren't too looking too far ahead into the semantics of this game. Despite their recent success, they have some questions to address - notably at the top of their batting order.\n\nAs I write this, Jonathan Trott inducts Alastair Cook's newest opening partner to the Test arena.\n\nOut in the middle, Jonathan Trott presents Mark Stoneman with his first Test cap. #ENGvWI -- Rob Johnston (@RobJ_Cricket)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nNobody is giving the Windies a chance. They've grown accustomed to that. Too comfortable even. It's about time they proved a few wrong now! Full Match Preview, here.\n\nWelcome to Edgbaston, for a historic Test match.

England are a very good cricket team. They've played some very good cricket, and a number of their players are in good form,\" Holder said.\n\nWest Indies have showed signs of form in the tour matches, with four batsmen - Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, and Kieran Powell - all getting\n\nhundreds in the drawn game against Derbyshire last week.\n\nSeamer Kemar Roach, on his first Test tour in nearly two years following a spell on the sidelines due to injury and loss of form, started the tour with a five-wicket haul against Essex, while rookie 20-year-old speedster Alzarri Joseph shone with a four-wicket haul against Kent.\n\nPacer Holder, who bowled well in the Derbyshire day/night game, said it was important that the Windies brought all the facets of their game together, especially since they would be playing under lights with the pink ball.\n\n\"I think our bowling has really carried us throughout the last few Test matches. We've got people like Shannon Gabriel, who has had a pretty decent year, myself I haven't been doing too badly,\" he pointed.\n\n\"It's just for our batsmen to make some runs. We've struggled in the past primarily with our batting, but so far on this tour we've been doing really well so I'm expecting things from the batsmen.\"\n\nThe Windies enter the series with a less-than-stellar recent record, with just three wins in their last 23 Tests and without a Test series win in three years.\n\nThe Test, the first to be played with the pink ball in England, bowls off at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. Eastern Caribbean time).\n\nWEST INDIES -

It is the kind of chilly weather that causes even Usain Bolt, a man built like a Greek God, to whimper in pain from a muscle cramp.\n\nYet, in such uncordial conditions, an anxious batsman from the Caribbean readies himself to face James Anderson -- the world's premier swing bowler -- with a seemingly innocuous pink ball in his hand.\n\nThe Lancashire pacer delivers three consecutive balls with the seam angled towards the slip fielders. The batsman is beaten on all three occasions. The fourth delivery is bowled with the seam pointed towards fine leg.\n\nEngland captain Joe Root and his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder pose with the Test series trophy ahead of the day-night Test in Edgbaston. Reuters\n\nCan you predict the next course of events?\n\nHas the batsman been trapped in front? Or has he tickled it fine as Anderson misses his line? Or has he perceived the bowler's plan and managed to keep the ball out?\n\n\"There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception\" - unknown (although, it is commonly attributed to Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World)\n\nWhat is known?\n\nTest cricket's novel day-night experiment was inaugurated in Adelaide in November 2015 and we witnessed Australia defeat New Zealand in a thrilling game of cricket. The second floodlit Test saw Pakistan edge past West Indies in another nail-biter in Dubai while Steve Smith's men triumphed against South Africa and Pakistan in the two day-nighters of Australia's 2016-17 home summer.\n\nCrowds poured in to watch the games under lights and TV viewership soared as ICC, Cricket Australia and network executives all popped champagne and did the happy dance on its success.\n\nHowever, the day-night Test between Pakistan and West Indies in Dubai, despite being a nail-biter, failed to entice the crowds in the UAE.\n\nOn Thursday, Edgbaston gets the honour of hosting the fifth pink ball Test as Joe Root's England take on Jason Holder's West Indies. It is the first ever day-night Test match to be hosted in England. Nearly 70,000 tickets have already been sold for the first three days of the Test and reportedly, two out of five ticket-holders have never seen a Test match before.\n\nDid you hear that sound? An ECB official just prematurely popped a champagne bottle.\n\nFollowing the first Test in Birmingham, the Windies travel to Headingley (25-29 August) and Lord's (7-11 September) for the remaining two Tests with a 2-day practice match against Leicestershire scheduled between the two. The Test series will be followed by a one-off T20I and five ODIs.\n\nThe inaugural day-night Test in Adelaide between Australia and New Zealand was a resounding success. Reuters\n\nJoe Root led England commendably in his first Test series as captain in what was ultimately a resounding series win over South Africa. Root and fellow Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow were the leading run-scorers in the series while the ever-improving Moeen Ali settled into his role as chief English spin wizard and topped the wickets chart. Ben Stokes continues to prove why he's every captain's dream as the Sky Sports commentary team seem to have finally stopped gabbing about who's the next Ian Botham. Even if not as prolific as before, Anderson and Stuart Broad are still a formidable new-ball pair and Alastair Cook still makes for a steady opener.\n\nAnd the West Indies sure have their task cut out against a better-adjusted England team. The Windies have not won a series in England for nearly three decades and their last overseas Test series victory (bar Zimbabwe and Bangladesh) came over two decades ago. Bitter disputes with the administration, lack of good first-class infrastructure and poor leadership has seen a storied cricketing powerhouse spiral in a downward trajectory into cricketing abyss.\n\nWhat is unknown?\n\nDespite the Windies' unremitting decline, their head coach Stuart Law is adamant his side has the ability to \"rewrite history.\" He urges his team to find \"any little crack\" they can find in the England team and exploit it with some good old guerrilla tactics.\n\nA manifest weakness in the England line-up is that almost everyone can bat except the guy partnering Cook at the top. Since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012, Cook has seen so many partners come and go, you would think he would suffer from chronic commitment issues.\n\nThe latest candidate is 30-year-old Mark Stoneman and England will hope their prolonged search ends this series so that they're more surefooted ahead of the Ashes Down Under.\n\nThe team also has a selection headache with the return of Chris Woakes, who will be itching to play at his home ground. While Toby-Roland Jones supported Broad and Anderson admirably in the series against Proteas, Woakes was a mainstay in all three formats for England before suffering a side strain in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 opener against Bangladesh.\n\nBut the biggest hurdle for Joe Root and co will be to navigate the terra incognita of playing in their first ever day-night Test with the seemingly enigmatic pink Duke ball.\n\nThe England team management have historically been meticulous to a fault but at Edgbaston, Broad, admittedly wary, said, \"We are stepping into the unknown.\"\n\nThough a trial round of County Championship day-night matches were held at the end of June, rain played spoilsport in most fixtures. Barring Cook and Anderson, not many benefited from the experience.\n\nEngland have a selection conundrum with the return of Chris Woakes. Reuters\n\nWhile the previous four floodlit Tests were played with Kookaburra pink balls, England and West Indies will be using the Duke equivalent in Birmingham.\n\nAnd its reviews are polarised. Broad said the County players claimed the pink ball went soft a lot more quickly than the red ball and that it bounced more for the spinners but didn't really turn. Some protested the lack of swing after the first few overs with an unsure Bairstow declaring noting he didn't know whether it was \"going to reverse or swing conventionally.\"\n\nFormer England cricketer Paul Collingwood, on BBC Radio 5, said otherwise claiming the ball \"was going all over the place\" in a county game he played against Worcestershire.\n\nThere are also doubts over the pink ball's visibility and durability.\n\nThe doors of perception\n\nHaving acclimatising themselves with three warm-up games against Essex, Kent and Derbyshire, Jason Holder and his men's best chance of causing an upset will be at Edgbaston having played in a day-night Test, unlike their hosts. In Dubai last year, Darren Bravo's fighting century brought West Indies awfully close to victory against Pakistan but they eventually lost by 56 runs.\n\nWith Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel and Alzarri Joseph, they have a pace attack that could cause problems to a vulnerable England top order. Roston Chase, Shai Hope and Kyle Hope impressed with centuries in the warmup against Derbyshire and with Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Jermaine Blackwood and Holder, there's enough batting talent with to mount a challenge.\n\nFor the sake of an exciting contest, one hopes the Windies entertain us again with their typical Calypso cricket.\n\nHowever, if England can overcome the pink ball challenge in Edgbaston, they should be able to clean sweep their opponents. The series is essentially an audition for Ashes berth and each player will look to impress.\n\nThe palpable lack of experience in the Windies Test team without the likes of Darren Bravo, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels will certainly hurt them. The Windies have not won a Test in England since 2000 and the aforementioned facts and reasons explain why they won't anytime soon.\n\nDespite all the expectations and wishful thinking, in the words of Huxley, \"Facts do not cease to exist just because they are ignored.\"\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 10:45 am | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 10:45 am\n\nTags : #Adelaide #Alastair cook #Aldous

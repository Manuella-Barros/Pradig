It put Denver in a financial bind that's forced the Broncos to make moves like releasing safety Justin Simmons to clear up $14.5 million in salary cap space after he earned three consecutive NFL All-Pro Team selections.\n\nThe biggest question for the Broncos this offseason is at the quarterback position, where veteran Jarrett Stidham and 2024 No. 12 overall pick Bo Nix are competing for the starting spot.\n\n\"It's important they're focused really on their job and what they're doing, and if you start to project (on the Broncos' depth chart) you can drive yourself crazy, and it's not really a clean or clear indicator as to what might happen,\" Payton told ESPN.\n\nThe Broncos open the preseason against the Colts on Aug. 11 at 11 a.m. MST. The Broncos play their final two preseason games at home, facing the Green Bay Packers on Aug. 15 and the Arizona Cardinals on Aug. 25.\n\nThe Broncos open the regular season on the road, traveling to play the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 8.\n\nThe Broncos' future, whatever it may be, seems mostly tied to Nix right now.

This will be an interesting game for the Broncos because of the amount of positional battles they currently have on their roster. We're in the middle of a quarterback competition and have roster battles all over their entire roster. This is also a young and inexperienced team so these preseason reps will be key for a number of the Broncos players.\n\nSo, let us take a look at the five storylines to watch during the Denver Broncos preseason openers vs. the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOf course, we need to start here.\n\nThe Broncos entered training camp with a three-man battle for their starting quarterback job. The three players are veteran Jarrett Stidham, former number two overall pick Zach Wilson, and 12th overall selection Bo Nix. This battle was quickly narrowed down to Stidham and Nix, but Zach Wilson is still competing for a roster spot and rehabbing his career with Sean Payton. This game will be huge for all three as the Broncos will have some real-life game action to evaluate as they decide who will be their week one starter.\n\nJarrett Stidham: Stidham will likely get the start and will need to show the Broncos coaches that he can be counted on to be their week one starter at quarterback. He has had a steady training camp and will need to carry that over into the preseason. Stidham needs to be efficient, show he can smoothly run the offense, not take any sacks, and protect the football. Ideally, he can lead the Broncos down for some points. With Nix on his heels and Zach Wilson turning things around recently, he cannot afford to have a bad game.\n\nBo Nix: This will be Nix's first game action in the NFL and he too will be under a lot of pressure to perform. He started off slow in training camp but he has continued to improve and is trending towards being the Broncos week one starter at quarterback. How he performs in this game will help mold the narrative moving forward. If he does well, the hype train will be full steam ahead but if he struggles, it could derail some of the momentum he has built up throughout camp. Like Stidham, Nix needs to get the ball out quickly, protect the ball, lead the offense smoothly, and ideally, put some points up on the board.\n\nZach Wilson: Wilson likely is not being considered for the Broncos starting quarterback job, but this preseason game, along with the other two games, will be crucial for him and his future with the Broncos and potentially in the NFL. He needs to prove that he is not the same quarterback we saw with the Jets and that he can flourish under Sean Payton in his offense. He will be going up against third-stringers and bottom of the roster players so he has a chance to really go off. A poor performance by Wilson would be disappointing and only cloud his future with the Broncos even more.\n\nThe Broncos offense is full of young players who all could have breakout performances during the preseason opener. Rookie running back Audric Estime, rookie wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Troy Franklin, along with tight end, Lucas Krull are all candidates to have a breakout performance during the Broncos preseason opener vs. the Colts.\n\nAudric Estime: The Broncos rookie running back should see significant snaps during the preseason and has a chance to be an impact player for them. He is a powerful, downhill runner who also has great vision and the ability to break off long runs. Estime has been having a great camp thus far and is itching to hit people so look for him to lower his shoulders and maybe have a few angry runs in this one.\n\nDevaughn Vele: The big rookie wide receiver has been a standout player during training camp and will likely be a heavily targeted player in the preseason. He is a big, athletic, and long receiver who can make plays downfield and in the end zone. We saw his incredible one-handed catch during Thursday's practice and I believe he will have more impact plays and be a standout player for the Broncos during the preseason.\n\nTroy Franklin: He is not having the training camp that we have all hoped but his speed could be on display in this one. He is one of the Broncos' premiere deep threats and I would expect Nix and Wilson to take a few deep shots to him in this one and throughout the preseason. A few deep receptions and long touchdowns will wipe away his slow start to training camp.\n\nLucas Krull: Krull is a big and athletic tight end who was the talk of the offseason. We have not heard a ton of hype about him throughout training camp, but I would expect him to be active during the preseason. Look for whoever is under center for the Broncos to target Krull in the middle of the field and in the end zone. He has flashed his big play ability last year and I would not be surprised if he did it again during the preseason.\n\nOne thing that is consistent throughout the preseason is poor offensive line play by the second and third-string offensive lines. For the Broncos, they will be watching their second and third strings and seeing who their top reserves can be for this upcoming season. They already lost their top reserve offensive lineman Quinn Bailey for the year, so they will be looking for their remaining depth to step up and fill that role.\n\nThe starting offensive line will need to show they can live up to their expectations. They are a highly-paid bunch but have had some issues in training camp with the Broncos' defensive line. This unit needs to prove they can protect the quarterback, open up running lanes, and live up to the high price tag they are being paid.\n\nFinally, the Broncos center competition will continue. Luke Wattenberg has been the starter but second-year player Alex Forsyth will need to show the team that he can be counted on to be the guy. Whoever loses this job will likely be their top interior reserve so hopefully, we see strong play from both of these players.\n\nOne of the top stories from this Broncos training camp has been the Broncos pass rush. Their new and improved defensive line has been generating pressure while Jonathon Cooper, Baron Browning, Thomas Incoom, and others have been getting after the quarterback off the edge. Browning and Cooper will likely only play a handful of snaps, but I want to see these two really get after the quarterback with their limited snaps.\n\nThomas Incoom has been having a strong camp and I want to see him carry that over into this one and get plenty of pressure and a sack or two to really solidify his spot on the roster. Rookie Jonah Elliss will be an intriguing player to watch as well. He is an explosive pass rusher who could flourish against the second and third-string tackles on the Colts roster.\n\nThen you have the third-string guys like rookie Jaylon Allen, Durrell Nchami, and Dondrea Tillman. They are all fighting for maybe one spot on the 53-man roster while also proving they belong to stick around on the practice squad. All three have flashed at times throughout camp and will need strong showings to show they deserve to stick around this season.\n\nSean Payton has mentioned how he really likes his young secondary and it will be tested in this one.\n\nAt cornerback, I expect Riley Moss and Damarri Mathis to see a lot of snaps and potentially even start the game. Both are coming off disappointing seasons and are competing for a starting job at corner. Veteran Levi Wallace who was having a good camp is sidelined with a hamstring injury so now the two young corners have an opportunity to separate themselves from their competition. I would love to see one or both of these players step up and play well but if both struggle, it could be a cause of some concern for Broncos fans. Don't sleep on rookie corner Kris Abrams-Draine and Reese Taylor in this one either. Both have had strong camps and could be pushing for roles and in Reese's case, a spot on the roster.\n\nAt safety, I will be watching JL Skinner and Devon Key. With Caden Sterns off the roster and Brandon Jones sidelined with a hamstring, these two should see significant snaps in this one. Both have had good camps and have a chance to show they can be trusted moving forward.\n\nSpecial teams: We'll see how the Broncos handle the new kickoff rule for the first time this season. We know Sean Payton has put an emphasis on special teams and learning this kickoff rule so we should keep a close eye on who's out there and who is doing well because this will help shape the back end of their roster.", "source": {"uri": "milehighreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mile High Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_payne@milehighreport.com", "name": "Scotty Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Stidham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Stidham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Krull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Krull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Franklin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audric_Estime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audric Estime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damarri_Mathis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damarri Mathis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Incoom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Incoom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JL_Skinner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JL Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riley Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Browning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baron Browning"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvgdQKFVF93MEHnPHvbpYf7Qr0Y=/0x0:3860x1930/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25565303/usa_today_23831252.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804987", "eventUri": "eng-9804987", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Both teams come into the 2024 season with anxiety-ridden fan bases and young quarterbacks looking to make big impressions.\n\nThe regular season series history between the teams goes back to 1974. The Colts barely lead the overall series history, 15-14-0. In preseason, Denver leads the series 7-6, including a 1-1 record on the road. Sunday will mark the 14th time these two teams have faced off in the preseason.\n\nThe latest matchup came in 2022 in a Week 5 Thursday Night Football matchup. It was perhaps the messiest game in recent memory for both teams: four combined interceptions between former quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Matt Ryan, six combined fumbles between Indy and Denver and 12 total punts in a 12-9 overtime loss for the Broncos.\n\nThis time around, the Colts boast second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson and the Broncos are fixing to have a three-man race for the starting job between Jarrett Stidham, rookie Bo Nix and journeyman Zach Wilson.\n\nWhile a win would be nice, more importantly, the Broncos and head coach Sean Payton will look to shape the 53-man roster. These preseason games will help Denver's staff evaluate players ahead of roster cuts later this month.", "source": {"uri": "broncoswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broncos Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_walker@broncoswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Brandon Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empower_Field_at_Mile_High", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empower Field at Mile High"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ryan_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Ryan (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Stidham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Stidham"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2024/08/Broncos-Colts-series-history.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804987", "eventUri": "eng-9804987", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

This will be Richardson's first game since Week 5 of the 2023 season.\n\nAlthough Richardson's rookie season was cut short due to injury, he does have a year under his belt in Shane Steichen's offense and that has been paying dividends in practice this summer. Also assisting Richardson this season will be the help he has around him, playing behind a stout offensive line, along with having Michael Pittman, Josh Downs, AD Mitchell, Alec Pierce, and Jonathan Taylor at the skill positions.\n\nThat, of course, doesn't mean there won't be ups and downs with Richardson still being a relatively inexperienced player, but he's entering a good situation to find success in his second season. One area of emphasis for the Colts' offense right now is on improving their pre-snap communication so that everyone is on the same page.\n\nAt this time of the year wins and losses take a back seat and the focus is on individual performances and key positional battles. For the Colts, a few of the noteworthy internal competitions taking place are at cornerback, safety, and receiver. For a look at all 11 positional battles ahead of Sunday's game, click here.\n\nHowever, having said that, the opponent that is lining up across from the Colts is going to impact on how all of that transpires. To help provide us with some insight into this Broncos, Jon Heath of Broncos Wire answered five of my questions to help preview the upcoming game.\n\n[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal] Will the Broncos play their starters?\n\nOct 29, 2023; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams (33) celebrates his touchdown with guard Ben Powers (74) in the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs at Empower Field at Mile High. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHeath: \"Yes, Broncos coach Sean Payton believes in playing starters during preseason, even if it's just for a few drives. Expect to see roughly 15-18 snaps for most of the team's healthy starters on Sunday. The only exception could be cornerback Pat Surtain, who was rested in the team's preseason opener last year.\"\n\nHow have things at QB unfolded this summer for Denver?\n\nMay 23, 2024; Englewood, CO, USA; Denver Broncos quarterback Zach Wilson (4) and quarterback Jarrett Stidham (8) during organized team activities at Centura Health Training Center. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHeath: \"Jarrett Stidham is the incumbent who has a year of experience in Sean Payton's offense, so it's no surprise that he's QB1 at the moment. Bo Nix is listed as QB3 on the \"unofficial depth chart,\" but he's been rotating with the first-team offense at practice. Zach Wilson seems to be the odd man out. It wouldn't be surprising to see Denver give Stidham and Nix one start each before officially naming a starter.\"\n\nWhat challenges can Denver provide the Colts' offense?\n\nDec 3, 2023; Houston, Texas, USA; Denver Broncos defensive end Zach Allen (99) attempts to tackle Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud (7) during the game at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHeath: \"The Broncos beefed up their defensive line this offseason by trading to John Franklin-Myers and signing Malcolm Roach during free agency. They also have Zach Allen returning as well as D.J. Jones. That's a promising front three that should be a decent test for Indy's talented offensive line. If he plays, Surtain is obviously the star of Denver's defense, so Richardson's performance against him will be interesting to track.\"\n\nWith positional battles at CB and S, how has the Denver passing game looked?\n\nCARSON, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 06: Courtland Sutton #14 of the Denver Broncos turns up field after his catch to score a touchdown, to take a 14-0 lead over the Los Angeles Chargers. during the first quarter at Dignity Health Sports Park on October 06, 2019 in Carson, California. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nHeath: \"That's a great question because we're going to see Denver's offense with a few new pieces for the first time in a game on Sunday. Stidham has been solid -- not great but not bad. Nix has been about what you'd expect from a first-round rookie, flashing signs of promise mixed in with a few hiccups. Courtland Sutton is back after scoring 10 touchdowns last season and the Broncos brought in Josh Reynolds during free agency, adding him to a rotation that also includes Marvin Mims and rookie Troy Franklin. A wild card to watch will be Tim Patrick, who will make his return on Sunday after missing back-to-back seasons with injuries. We're not quite sure what to expect from Denver's QBs, but the team has enough talent at WR to give Indy's secondary a good look.\"\n\nLet's take a look way ahead, the Colts and Broncos play later this season, what's your early prediction?\n\nSep 10, 2023; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II (2) reacts in the first quarter against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHeath: \"Boy, it's hard to project that far out, but I am a big believer in Anthony Richardson. The Broncos have struggled to contain mobile QBs in the past, and teams ran up and down the field against them last year. That's good news for Jonathan Taylor, although -- as noted above -- Denver did bring in some defensive line reinforcements this spring. My gut says the Colts will be considered favorites, but the Broncos will get somewhat of a boost playing at home. Not knowing if it will be Stidham or Nix under center for Denver, my way-too-early prediction will be a close win for Indy.\"", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

After a long, often tedious offseason, the Denver Broncos will be in action at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, Aug. 9 when they take on the Indianapolis Colts in their first preseason game of 2024.\n\nThe Broncos have had plenty of offseason additions to keep track of this season, and there are a lot of names to watch when the team faces off against the Colts on Sunday afternoon. Below are five players to keep a close eye on as the game progresses!\n\nForsyth has been in a camp battle with Luke Wattenberg to see who takes the starting center position for the Broncos this season.The team decided not to add anyone but journeyman Sam Mustipher at the position, hoping Wattenberg or Forsyth would lay claim to the position. The team needs this offensive line to be a strength, and center is the only position along the line where the team will see a new starter come in in 2024.\n\nWhen Abrams-Draine was drafted, he was penciled into the backup nickel position by many analysts almost immediately. But as Riley Moss and Damarri Mathis have battled for the second outside corner position without either taking a clear lead, many have begun to wonder if Abrams-Draine could fill in there. At 5'11, he's got the size to compete, but will the team give him a chance to prove himself there in preseason action?\n\nEstime looks like an absolute monster, and reports out of Broncos training camp indicate he's eager to stop going against teammates he can't hit in earnest. The 2024 fifth-round selection could have a big presence on the field for Denver this year, especially if he can show off his receiving skills in preseason the way he has at times in camp.\n\nMuch like the second corner position, the Broncos are hoping someone in their safety room takes over the lead for snaps after a hamstring injury sidelined Brandon Jones early in camp. Skinner was a sixth-round pick from 2023, and mostly saw the field on special teams last year. But Sean Payton has singled him out for praise in 2024 training camp, and he could be a late-round gem the Broncos sorely need.\n\nObviously, the Broncos' first-round quarterback has to be on this list, right? Nix has shown enough in camp to compete with incumbent Jarret Stidham for first-team snaps, but hasn't cemented the starter's job. If he turns in a good performance in his first preseason game, he'll make a big case for starting the second, and from there he could lay claim to the job before the season opener in September.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Wattenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Wattenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damarri_Mathis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damarri Mathis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riley Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mustipher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mustipher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Jones_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Jones (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/bo%20nix_4.jpg?itok=NSALEgLC", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804987", "eventUri": "eng-9804987", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 125}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Now, recently launched technologies such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, Google's Gemini-1.5 Pro and Veo, a video-generating AI model, are astonishing. The competitive releases of such robots and smartphones with cutting-edge AI technologies are not only sparking users' curiosity, but also heralding revolutions between countries and across industries.\n\nLet's take a look at a recent survey of more than 30,000 people in 31 countries on the use of generative AI. Three out of four employees, or 75 percent, say they are using AI technologies for work, and 85 percent said they personally use AI tools without company support. While 79 percent of employees in leadership positions said AI is essential for their companies to maintain competitiveness, 60 percent said they worry about a lack of vision and clear plans about using AI for their work.\n\nCompanies are moving fast to apply generative AI to their work, but are also utterly perplexed as novel AI models equipped with dazzling features are released every day.\n\nWhile individual users can easily use AI technologies with a little training, companies must take into account many things when they apply the technologies to company operations. There are several steps companies can take to use AI for their business.\n\nThe first step is the \"personal assistant stage,\" where AI is applied to groupware, document creation and other works. The second step is the \"search assistant stage,\" where AI queries and analyzes internal and external laws, regulations, standards, guidelines, tax codes, manuals and the current status of business performance.\n\nThird is the \"business assistant stage,\" where AI processes and manages tasks in conjunction with the company's legacy systems. The fourth is using AI as a \"management assistant\" that connects data and systems at home and abroad to manage and support decision-making. There is also the fifth stage where AI makes its own judgment and executes plans, but it will likely be safer if the technology is still under human control than otherwise.\n\nWhat should we do to introduce such AI systems for companies?\n\nFirst, it is necessary for a company to build consensus on how to apply AI to their work through workshops, for example.\n\nSecond, the company should develop an information strategy plan (ISP) based on the outcomes of the workshops. You can expect great results from an AI service when high quality data are systematically organized. Therefore, the ISP must include a set of plans to secure data from inside and outside the company, clean them and upgrade information technology systems with the data.\n\nAs companies have just started using AI, they do not have solutions or the manpower to deal with system connections, data management and information security. Therefore, it's better for companies to apply AI to their operations step by step rather than changing the entire system from the start.\n\nThird, it is necessary for companies to verify the effectiveness of applying AI through the proof of concept. Based on this, companies can select the most suitable AI product and decide whether to build data on their own or use the cloud.\n\nFourth, companies must designate an AI specialist in each department to push forward digital innovation using AI.\n\nFifth, as many new technologies are being developed and released, it is necessary to strengthen an executive-level innovation team capable of pushing forward a project to integrate information technology, digital transformation, big data, AI and digital-related tasks, which are scattered across various divisions of the company. This innovation team should also be awarded with governance power.\n\nIt's not wise to use such powerful generative AI simply to replace manual labor or take meeting minutes. Companies should make bold decisions to use AI to do things that would otherwise be difficult or apply the latest management practices and production theories. Companies can also act boldly to use AI to analyze vast amounts of data to increase productivity or develop new products that reflect trends.\n\nIntroducing AI to improve individual workers' productivity should be a secondary goal.\n\nTranslation by the Korea JoongAng Daily staff.", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonsei_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonsei University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collaborative software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_JoongAng_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korea JoongAng Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proof of concept"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/07/09/6bb4e1de-6c68-4065-bd10-eb4cd1437574.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Since then, everyone, from startups to old-line businesses, has rushed to claim they are doing it.\n\nIt's no wonder, as McKinsey's report, \"Mind the Gap: AI Leaders Pulling Ahead\" has shown that companies adopting AI are growing faster than their competitors. For investors and finance, understanding whether a company uses AI properly now translates into wasting money or reaping rewards. So how can you tell whether a company is a poser or the real deal?\n\nAll AI projects start with people.\n\nAI is complex to implement well, requiring companies to select a robust use case and carefully consider the consequences for a successful implementation. Let's start by looking at some clear pretenders.\n\nRule 1: Avoid Overreliance on Vendor APIs\n\nIf a startup relies on OpenAI or Anthropic to power its backend, it may not have a genuine grasp of its technological direction. Entrusting their core operations to external platforms leaves them vulnerable, lacking control over their future trajectory. Moreover, while prominent vendors may offer seemingly attractive pricing, the startup risks becoming entangled in a dependency loop with little autonomy over its technological infrastructure. Given the fluid nature of AI development, relying on these platforms poses the additional challenge of uncertain long-term access. Hence, startups should exercise caution when seeking financing for or implementing services from such providers.\n\nRule 2: Ensure Proper Board Oversight\n\nWhen evaluating a mainline company's claim of adopting AI, scrutiny of its board of directors becomes paramount. Who on the board has the experience and knowledge about AI to ask the right questions? How is the risk being managed? Who is responsible for governance and compliance? Suppose all the board members have technology knowledge ten years out of date, or worse yet, little to no relevant technological understanding of AI. How do you know if a joint venture will enhance shareholder value? How do you know this company is properly controlling the risks and potential of AI?\n\nRule 3: The CEO Needs to Assemble a Cross-Functional AI Team\n\nWhat is the CEO's role in AI integration? Enabling AI enterprise-wide requires CEO leadership, not limited to one department. A well-coordinated effort across Finance, HR, Legal, Data Analytics and IT is essential. If IT adopts tools like Copilot from Microsoft as they are already using other Microsoft packages, considerations include user adoption, risks, data security, and alignment with business objectives. Is the AI strategy well-conceived to leverage its full potential?\n\nRule 4: The CEO Needs to Champion Targeted Use Cases\n\nIdentify CEOs who actively champion specific AI use cases within their organizations. Concrete examples of use cases not only drive efficiency and service improvement but also enable the development of new capabilities. A competent CEO should possess a thorough understanding of these use cases, beyond mere acknowledgment of generic AI adoption. While most companies stand to benefit from AI, the key lies in strategic applications. Finance teams should rigorously assess the financial viability of AI initiatives to ensure a favorable return on investment (ROI). Prioritize projects with well-defined goals that closely align with the organization's overarching business objectives.\n\nRule 5: Start Focused vs Diffuse AI Adoption\n\nExercise caution when encountering companies attempting to integrate AI into every aspect of their operations without adequate experience. While technology-focused giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta can swiftly adopt AI due to their expertise, smaller companies like Acme Bolts should proceed with more discernment. While embracing AI is crucial for staying competitive to keep up or leapfrog its competitors, overzealous adoption without proper experience can lead to detrimental outcomes. These companies must prioritize gaining experience and proficiency in implementing and managing AI solutions effectively before attempting widespread integration.\n\nRule 6: Carefully Select External Partners\n\nHas the company assembled the right team for implementing AI solutions? Given the complexity of AI, most companies lack the requisite expertise to implement it independently. Is the company selecting the right partners for collaboration? A comprehensive strategy will include various stakeholders, including data providers, technology experts, and compliance managers, to ensure a holistic approach to AI integration.\n\nAI implementation revolves around people. The success of large-scale projects like this hinges on securing buy-in from stakeholders at every level. It's crucial to meticulously plan the business cases, develop appropriate strategies and policies for AI usage, and establish robust governance, auditing, and risk management frameworks. All these critical steps require human input and careful consideration. Ensuring alignment within the entire C-Suite on key aspects of the AI program is essential for its effective execution.\n\nOver the next 20 years, AI will revolutionize business even more profoundly than the internet did. Companies that fail to adapt to this paradigm shift will get crushed, or at best, risk being left behind as AI becomes integral to the workplace. Recognizing that AI solutions are not one-size-fits-all, but rather customized to each company's unique needs is paramount. Finance and banking sectors, in particular, need to be aware of the opportunities and risks presented by AI. They must cultivate the ability to assess proposed AI implementations critically and understand their impact on company valuations. With AI set to permeate every sector, it is imperative for the finance industry to embrace AI now to remain competitive in the future.", "source": {"uri": "finextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finextra Research"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate title"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm shift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.finextra.com/finextra-images/member_photos/thumb_162616_erica_andersen_12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The symbiotic relationship between AI and humans points toward a future where collaboration and interaction between human intelligence and artificial systems become seamlessly integrated into daily life, the process of which we can already see as having started.\n\nThe first step towards this co-evolution is already visible through the integration of AI in various aspects of human life. From virtual assistants that manage our schedules to sophisticated algorithms that suggest what to watch or buy, AI has begun to augment our decision-making processes and personal preferences. These interactions are poised to become deeper and more complex, as AI systems learn to adapt and respond to individual human behaviour and needs more effectively.\n\nOne of the most profound impacts of AI on human evolution could be in enhancing our cognitive capacities. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are being developed to directly link human brains to computers, enabling not just enhanced mental capabilities, such as improved memory or decision-making skills, but also a direct communication pathway between humans and machines. This could lead to a new form of intelligence, a hybrid of human emotional depth and machine precision, unlocking potentials in creativity, analysis, and problem-solving that are currently unimaginable.\n\nAs AI technologies advance, they are likely to become more personalised. Future AI systems could act as personalised agents, understanding individual user needs and acting accordingly. This could range from managing health and diet based on personal genetics and lifestyle to customising learning and career development programmes that adapt to an individual's pace and learning style. Such personalisation would foster a unique bond between humans and AI, with AI systems functioning as both tools and companions, deeply integrated into the fabric of individual human life.\n\nHowever, this deep integration brings forth significant ethical implications. As AI begins to influence daily decisions, there arises a concern about the loss of autonomy and the potential for manipulation. The ability of AI to not just suggest but also subtly influence human thoughts and actions with personalised data raises questions about privacy and consent. Moreover, as humans become more reliant on AI for cognitive tasks, there might be a shift in what is considered essential human knowledge, possibly leading to a re-evaluation of educational goals and personal development strategies.\n\nThe co-evolution of AI and humans will also significantly impact work and social structures. With robots and AI systems taking over routine and even complex tasks, human roles in workplaces will shift towards more creative, managerial, or empathetic roles that machines cannot easily replicate. This could lead to a significant transformation in job markets and necessitate a rethinking of economic systems, perhaps moving towards models that prioritise well-being and creative engagement over productivity and efficiency.\n\nAs humans adapt to a life integrated with AI, future generations might develop different cognitive and social skills, emphasising traits that benefit from the symbiotic relationship, such as adaptability, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary knowledge.\n\nThe future of AI and human co-evolution holds tremendous potential but also significant challenges. It promises a world where human capabilities are enhanced beyond our current limitations, creating possibilities for higher levels of understanding and new forms of creativity. However, it also compels us to confront critical ethical questions and to carefully consider how we design and implement AI technologies. The balance we achieve between these opportunities and challenges will define the character of our shared future with AI, shaping not only what it means to be human but also the values and priorities of our society.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coevolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\u2013computer_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain\u2013computer interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human behavior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symbiosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social structure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/09/1600x900/Screenshot_2024-01-14_173954_1705234246481_1720518326500.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But first we must sidestep the technology's risks", "body": "I've got some AI news of my own this week. My book Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future is officially being published today by Simon & Schuster in the U.S.\n\nWhen ChatGPT debuted in November 2022, it was a light bulb moment -- one that suddenly awakened people to the possibilities of AI technology. But it was also a vertigo-inducing moment, one that prompted a lot of anxious questions: Was AI about to take their job? Would entire companies be put out of business? Was the ability of AI to write cogent essays and analyses about to blow up our education system? Were we about to be hit with a tsunami of AI-crafted misinformation? Might AI soon develop consciousness and decide to kill or enslave us?\n\nMastering AI is my attempt to explain how we arrived at this moment and answer these questions. It is intended to serve as an essential primer for how to think through the impacts AI is poised to have on our personal and professional lives, our economy, and on society. In the book, I have tried to illuminate a path -- a narrow one, but a path nonetheless -- that can ensure that the good AI does outweighs the harm it might cause.\n\nIn researching the book, I interviewed individuals who are at the forefront of developing AI, thinking through its impacts, and putting new AI tools to use. I spoke to OpenAI cofounders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, as well as its former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever; Google DeepMind cofounders Demis Hassabis and Shane Legg; and Anthropic cofounder Dario Amodei. I also talked to dozens of startup founders, economists, and philosophers, as well as writers and artists, and entrepreneurs and executives inside some of America's largest corporations.\n\nIf we design AI software carefully and regulate it vigilantly, it will have tremendous positive impacts. It will boost labor productivity and economic growth, something developed economies desperately need. It will give every student a personal tutor. It will help us find new treatments for disease and usher in an era of more personalized medicine. It could even enhance our democracy and public discourse, helping to break down filter bubbles and persuade people to abandon conspiracy theories.\n\nBut, as it stands, we are too often not designing this technology carefully and deliberately. And regulation is, for the moment, lacking. This should scare us. For all its opportunities, AI presents grave dangers too. In Mastering AI, I detail many of these risks, some of which have not received the attention they deserve. Dependence on AI software could diminish critical human cognitive skills, including our memory, critical thinking, and writing skills; reliance on AI chatbots and assistants could damage important social skills, making it harder to form human relationships. If we don't get the development and regulation of this technology right, AI will depress wages, concentrate corporate power, and make inequality worse. It will boost fraud, cybercrime, and misinformation. It will erode societal trust and hurt democracy. AI could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. All of these risks are present with AI technology that exists today. There is also a remote -- but not completely nonexistent -- chance that a superintelligent AI system could pose an existential risk to humanity. It would be wise to devote some effort to taking this last risk off the table, but we should not let these efforts distract or crowd out work we need to do to solve AI's more immediate challenges.\n\nIn Mastering AI, I recommend a series of steps we can take to avoid these dangers. The most important is to ensure we don't allow AI to displace the central role that human decision-making and empathy should play in high-consequence domains, from law enforcement and military affairs to lending and social welfare decisions. Beyond this, we need to encourage the development of AI as a complement to human intelligence and skills, rather than a replacement. This requires us to reframe how we think about AI and how we assess its capabilities. Benchmarking that evaluates how well humans can perform when paired with AI software -- as opposed to constantly pitting AI's abilities against those of people -- would be a good place to start. Policies such as a targeted robot tax could also help companies see AI as a way to boost the productivity of existing workers, not as a way to eliminate jobs. Mastering AI contains many more insights about AI's likely impacts.\n\nToday, Fortune has published an excerpt from the book about how AI could make filter bubbles worse, but also how -- with the right design choices -- the same technology could help pop these bubbles and combat polarization. You can read that excerpt here. I hope you'll also consider reading the rest of the book, which is now available at your favorite bookstore and can be purchased online here.

This week the GOP laid out its 2024 platform -- the first since 2016 -- which is mostly Donald Trump's former platform, including the addition of many in all capital letters. But there is one notable change: In a sign that AI regulation has become politicized, the platform says it will champion innovation in artificial intelligence by repealing Joe Biden's \"dangerous Executive Order\" that \"hinders innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.\" In its place, it says that Republicans support \"AI development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\" The policy, which also emphasizes an end to a \"crypto crackdown,\" aligns with the pro-technology/anti-regulation \"e/acc\" (effective accelerationism) crowd. Investor Julie Frederickson, for example, claimed on X that \"a coalition of e/acc and crypto and El Segundo hardware and deep tech autists changed a political party's platform.\"\n\nLeaders of major world religions gather to sign the Rome Call for AI Ethics. In 2020, the Vatican, along with Microsoft, IBM, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Italian Government, released the Rome Call for AI Ethics. Now, leaders of major world religions are gathering today and tomorrow in Hiroshima, Japan to sign the Rome Call, in a city that a press release called \"a powerful testament to the consequences of destructive technology and the enduring quest for peace.\" The event will emphasize the \"vital importance of guiding the development of artificial intelligence with ethical principles to ensure it serves the good of humanity.\"\n\nNicolas Cage is 'terrified' of AI using his likeness. In an interview with the New Yorker, actor Nicolas Cage said that he was on his way to get a digital scan for his next movie -- and he worried whether they were using AI. \"They have to put me in a computer and match my eye color and change -- I don't know,\" he said. \"They're just going to steal my body and do whatever they want with it via digital AI...God, I hope not AI I'm terrified of that. I've been very vocal about it.\" He said he worried about whether artists would be replaced: \"Is it going to be transmogrified? Where's the heartbeat going to be? I mean, what are you going to do with my body and my face when I'm dead? I don't want you to do anything with it!\" Others, however, apparently don't have that concern: The estates of deceased celebrities like Judy Garland and James Dean recently gave AI company ElevenLabs permission to use the stars' voices in audiobook voiceovers.\n\nAI researchers consider evaluations and benchmarking to be critical for assessing the performance, robustness, and performance of AI models -- that is, ensuring the systems meet certain standards before they are deployed in real-world applications. But a new research paper by five Princeton University researchers says the current evaluation and benchmarking processes for AI agents -- based on using large language models in combination with other tools, like web search, to take actions like booking flight tickets or fixing software bugs -- may encourage the development of agents that do well in benchmarks, but not in practice.\n\n\"The North Star of this field is to build assistants like Siri or Alexa and get them to actually work -- handle complex tasks, accurately interpret users' requests, and perform reliably,\" said a blog post about the paper by two of its authors, Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan, who are also the authors of AI Snake Oil. \"But this is far from a reality, and even the research direction is fairly new.\"\n\nChina is still a decade behind the U.S. in chip technology -- but the world still needs the mature chips it's making, says ASML's CEO -- by Lionel Lim\n\nInstacart's AI-powered smart carts, which offer real-time recommendations and 'gamified' shopping, are coming to more U.S. grocery stores -- by Sasha Rogelberg\n\nTwo self-driving car guys take on OpenAI's Sora, Kling, and Runway to be Hollywood's favorite AI -- by Jeremy Kahn\n\nChinese self-driving cars have quietly traveled 1.8 million miles on U.S. roads, collecting detailed data with cameras and lasers -- by Rachyl Jones\n\nJuly 15-17: Fortune Brainstorm Tech in Park City, Utah (register here)\n\nJuly 21-27: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Vienna, Austria\n\nThe phrase \"large language model,\" or LLM, became part of the public discourse when OpenAI's ChatGPT launched in 2022 and showed that giant models based on massive datasets could attempt to mimic human-level \"intelligence.\" But over the past few months, \"small language model,\" or SLM, has begun to make regular appearances in my email inbox. A recent Wall Street Journal article tackled this trend, with a deep dive into these mini-models that are trained on far less data than LLMs, and typically designed for specific tasks. Big pros of SLMs include their lower training costs -- LLMs cost hundreds of millions of dollars to train, while smaller models can be had for $10 million or less. They also use less computing power, making it less costly to generate each query response (a process called inference). Microsoft and Google, as well as AI startups including Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral, have all released small models. Meta has also released SLM versions of its Llama family of models.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_kahn@fortune.com", "name":

Never Mind, Says Goldman Sachs - Decrypt", "body": "Hold onto your hats, tech enthusiasts, because Goldman Sachs has just thrown a curveball in the ongoing saga of generative AI. In their latest report, the investment powerhouse seems to have changed its phrasing from cautious optimism to a more skeptical outlook on the immediate benefits of AI investments.\n\nThe global investment banking firm's June 2024 report, \"Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\" provides a reality check for those bullish on AI. Despite the tech industry's exuberance and a staggering $1 trillion that's forecasted to be spent on AI infrastructure, the report highlights the sobering view of MIT's Daron Acemoglu and Goldman Sachs' own Jim Covello.\n\nAcemoglu estimates that AI will automate less than 5% of tasks in the next decade, contributing a meager 0.9% to GDP growth. Covello goes even further, arguing that the current AI tech isn't equipped to solve complex problems cost-effectively -- at least not one that's worth investing $1 trillion dollars on.\n\n\"AI bulls seem to just trust that use cases will proliferate as the technology evolves,\" he said in an interview cited by the report, \"but eighteen months after the introduction of generative AI to the world, not one truly transformative -- let alone cost-effective -- application has been found.\"\n\nFor Jim Covello, this issue has some level of resemblance to the dotcom bubble (and for us, crypto). However, the impact of a future AI winter will depend on the real use cases that the technology can offer.\n\n\"If AI technology ends up having fewer use cases and lower adoption than consensus currently expects, it's hard to imagine that [a bust of the AI bubble] won't be problematic for many companies spending on the technology today,\" he said.\n\nCovello believes the AI hype could last for another 18 months before investors start to lose interest due to the lack of truly meaningful advances.\n\nThis issue of the markets being in a bubble has been touched on before by even major voices inside the AI community. Just one year ago, Emad Mostaque, now former CEO of Stability AI, warned about generative AI being an overhyped technology. \"I think this will be the biggest bubble of all time,\" Mostaque said in a conversation with UBS analysts. \"I call it the 'dot AI' bubble, and it hasn't even started yet.\"\n\nBut there is also room for some long-term bullishness. Rash Rangan, a U.S. software analyst cited in the report, argues that AI companies today are building the foundations of a next-gen profitable industry.\n\n\"The AI cycle is still very much in the infrastructure buildout phase, so finding the killer application will take more time, but I believe we'll get there,\" Rangan said. That said, he is not super bullish in the short term and also believes the clock is ticking for AI startups.\n\n\"I could become more concerned if scaled consumer applications don't emerge over the next 6 to 18 months,\" he added.\n\nContrast that with Goldman Sachs' own May 2024 report, which despite its cautious tone, was practically lyrical about AI's potential. The report, led by Joseph Briggs, predicted generative AI would eventually boost U.S. productivity by 9% and GDP by 6.1% over ten years. It painted a rosy picture of AI laying the groundwork for future efficiency gains and economic growth, emphasizing early positive signals from AI adoption in specific sectors.\n\n\"The early signals of future productivity gains look very, very positive,\" Briggs wrote. The report pointed out that generative AI, if proven profitable, would begin providing a meaningful impact on the economy in 2027 at the latest.\n\nThis was also mimicking JP Morgan's outlook for the whole AI industry, which said, \"Wall Street thinks today's AI leaders will deliver better earnings growth than it expected from dot-com leaders even as the AI stocks trade at much lower prices as measured by the P/E ratio.\"\n\nFor JP Morgan, AI could have a major impact in industries like logistics or finance, in what they called the transition to \"AI 2.0.\"\n\nSo, why the sudden change in tune? The June report pointed out the high costs, slow returns, and significant infrastructure challenges that could throttle AI's growth.\n\nLast year, private investment in generative AI reached more than $20 billion, according to Stanford University, but in 2024 investment significantly dropped with Ernst and Young estimating that around $12 billion will find its way into AI this year.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are expecting to see a downward correction in AI-related equities. So, bubble or not, most predictors indicate that the AI market is experiencing a slowdown.\n\nThe next few quarters will likely prove crucial in determining whether generative AI can deliver on its promises, or if the industry is indeed headed for a cooling period. This could leave many high-powered GPUs -- once crucial for generative AI startups to create all those cute cat pictures and anime waifus- sitting idle as markets recalibrate their expectations.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_antonio_lanz@decrypt.co", "name": "Jose Antonio Lanz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI winter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killer application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jaldps_a_photo_of_a_bum_broken_cyborg_begging_for_money_on_th_8b19fa12-2e4a-454e-917d-35de6a0e2780_0-gID_7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The future of work in the age of automation", "body": "Henryk Krajewski, Ph.D. is an executive director at leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates. He specializes in working with CEOs and teams on creating high-performance organizations.\n\nAccording to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, less than one in three Canadians trust artificial intelligence and more than half are hesitant or resistant to innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) - nearly as many who feel the same away about genetically modified foods.\n\nFair enough. Our popular news and social media sources inundate us with news of how AI is going to take over our jobs and our worlds. Mark Cuban, billionaire investor and former majority owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, said AI is \"bad news for employment ... there is going to be more people out of work.\" Likewise, Elon Musk recently stated that \"long term ... any job that somebody does will be optional.\"\n\nSo, is this the promise of AI - that it will slowly but surely put us all out of work? If so, where will it start and with which jobs? What will the state of the workplace look like? And what should employees be doing to prepare?\n\nIn terms of where AI is having the greatest current impact, Jason Lee, who leads the applied data team at advisory firm MNP, told me \"sectors like manufacturing, energy, utilities and the public sector are experiencing substantial AI impact, with [generative] AI set to disrupt financial services, insurance and energy industries. Roles such as office support, sales, legal, business operations and healthcare support will be most affected.\"\n\nBut what about AI itself? Surely there must be job growth in careers related to creating, working and managing AI technologies.\n\nIndeed, Fawad Bajwa, global AI practice leader at leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates, sees an upswing in the global demand for AI-related roles. \"The demand for talent in this space is substantially higher than what it was 18 months ago when AI was not on top of everyone's mind,\" he told me.\n\nMany organizations are indeed building and attracting talent in AI-related fields, across industries and across the globe. Mr. Bajwa said \"no industry will be untouched by AI and the need for AI talent. Like the Industrial Revolution disrupted blue-collar jobs, the AI revolution will disrupt white-collar jobs.\"\n\nAre Mr. Cuban and Mr. Musk right? Are we all going to lose our jobs to AI? Should we fear or embrace the shift, and why? I asked these questions of Google's cloud and AI leader for Canada, Sam Sebastian.\n\n\"While the adoption of new technology often comes with uncertainty, I believe AI will in fact enable us to be more human. If we embrace AI correctly, we will open up opportunities for all workers to focus on strategy and human connection, driving more impact,\" he said. \"For example, Doctors are using AI to take and file notes, so they can spend more time with patients, and marketers leverage AI to build visuals, so they can focus on brand strategy and audience engagement.\"\n\nMr. Lee concurs, saying \"human input remains crucial alongside automation, preserving the unique insights and experiences of workers.\"\n\nMr. Bajwa summed it up well: \"AI will not replace humans. But ... humans with AI will replace humans without AI.\"\n\nWorkers must now all make one critical mindset shift, followed by one simple action. In terms of mindset, we need to recognize that humans are psychologically wired with a negativity bias, which associates change with a certain degree of fear and loss. Thus, humans much prefer avoiding pain in the short term (changing routines, learning new technologies) rather than approaching gains for the long term (being first in line for new opportunities, embracing new technology). It's hard for most people to see that the greater risk is in not going along with the AI revolution.\n\nWhat is the simple action? Experiment. Many have access to Microsoft's Copilot companion through their work and don't even know what it can do. Google's Gemini can be a life companion for just about any need. Many organizations have internal GenAI systems running and available to experiment with. Research shows the No. 1 predictor of whether someone integrates AI into their work and life is whether they will experiment with different ways of using AI. More than 90 per cent of such experimenters report multiple benefits, including managing workloads, enhancing focus and boosting creativity.\n\nWhat does AI itself have to say about AI and jobs? I asked Google Gemini and its first answer was quite equivocal. When pressed, Gemini first apologized, then admitted \"there will indeed be substantial job impact, because AI can learn and perform tasks much faster than humans, making it efficient for repetitive jobs. While new AI-focused fields will emerge, they may not require the same number of workers being displaced.\"\n\nIndeed, the AI revolution is a critical waypoint for evolving organizations - and leadership will play a pivotal role in shaping its success. How leaders approach its adoption, however, can have unintended consequences.

From boosting productivity and innovation, to ushering in an era of augmented work where human skills are assisted by AI technology, the opportunities are limitless. But some risks accompany these opportunities. We've all heard stories about AI hallucinations presenting fictional data as facts, and warnings from experts about potential cybersecurity issues.\n\nThese stories emphasize the numerous ethical issues that companies must address to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly and benefits society. It can be a challenge to fully understand the workings of AI systems. Addressing these issues and building trusted and ethical AI has never been more important. To ensure responsible adoption of the technology, businesses need to embed both ethical and security considerations at every stage of the journey - from the point of identifying potential AI use-cases and their impact on the organization, to the actual development and adoption of AI.\n\nMany organizations are adopting a cautious approach when it comes to AI adoption. Our recent research revealed that despite 96% of business leaders considering generative AI as a hot boardroom topic, a sizeable proportion of businesses (39%) were taking a \"wait-and-watch\" approach. This is not surprising, given that the technology is still in its infancy.\n\nBut leveraging AI also enables a strong competitive advantage, so first movers in this space have a lot to gain if they do it right. The responsible adoption of generative AI begins with understanding and tackling the associated risks. Issues like bias, fairness, and transparency need to be considered from the very beginning, when use cases are being explored. Once a thorough risk assessment is performed, organizations need to devise clear strategies for mitigating the identified risks.\n\nFor instance, implementing safeguards, making sure the governance framework to oversee AI operations is in place, and addressing any issues related to intellectual property rights. Generative AI models can produce unexpected and unintended outputs, so continuous monitoring, evaluation, and feedback loops are key to stopping hallucinations that could cause harm or damage to individuals or organizations.\n\nWith Large Language Model (LLM) there is always the risk that biased or inaccurate data compromises the quality of the output, creating ethical risks. To tackle this, businesses should establish robust validation mechanisms to cross-check AI outputs against reliable data sources. Implementing a layered approach where AI outputs are reviewed and verified by human experts can add a further layer of security and prevent the circulation of false or biased information.\n\nEnsuring that private company data remains secure is another critical challenge. Establishing guardrails to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or data leakage are essential. Companies should employ encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to safeguard sensitive information. By establishing guardrails and orchestration layers, AI models will operate within safe and ethical boundaries. Additionally, using synthetic data (artificially generated data that mimics real data) can help maintain data privacy while enabling AI model training.\n\nSince the inception of generative AI, one of the biggest challenges to its safe adoption has been the lack of wider understanding that LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, and the potential for human bias as part of this training. Transparency over how these models make decisions is vital to building trust among users and stakeholders.\n\nThere needs to be clear communication about how LLMs work, the data they use, and the decisions they make. Businesses should document their AI processes and provide stakeholders with understandable explanations of AI operations and decisions. This transparency not only fosters trust but also allows for accountability and continuous improvement.\n\nAdditionally, establishing a trust layer around AI models is crucial. This layer involves continuous monitoring for potential anomalies in AI behaviors and ensuring that AI tools are tested in advance and used securely. By doing so, companies can maintain the integrity and reliability of AI outputs, building trust among users and stakeholders.\n\nFinally, developing industry-wide standards for AI use through collaboration among stakeholders can ensure responsible AI deployment. These standards should encompass ethical guidelines, best practices for model training and deployment, and protocols for handling AI-related issues. Such collaboration can lead to a more unified and effective approach to managing AI's societal impact.\n\nThe potential of AI cannot be overstated. It allows us to solve complex business problems, predict scenarios and analyze huge volumes of information that can give us a better understanding of the world around us, speed up innovation, and aid scientific discovery. However, as with any emerging technology, we are still on the learning curve and lacking regulation. Proper care and consideration, therefore, needs to be taken with its deployment.\n\nGoing forward, it is imperative that businesses have a clear strategy for the safe adoption of generative AI, which involves embedding guardrails at every stage of the process and continuous monitoring of the risks. Only then can organizations fully realize its benefits, while mitigating against its potential pitfalls.\n\nWe feature the best AI tools.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Access control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continual improvement process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Learning curve"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuJ2nHdA2cLngX4bhsHsye-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

As a seasoned agency coach and former marketing agency owner, Rob brings a wealth of knowledge to the table.\n\nRob is the author of \"The Self-Running Agency\" and host of the Agency Accelerator Podcast, where he shares his expertise and insights with a wide audience.\n\nToday, we're excited to welcome Rob Da Costa to discuss the impact of AI on agencies and how to navigate these changes effectively. Rob will share his insights on how AI is transforming the agency landscape and provide strategies for coping with these advancements.\n\nLet's get started...\n\n1. Can you introduce yourself and explain how your AI Coach, AskRobAnything, supports your coaching program?\n\nHi there, I'm Rob. I have developed an AI coach, AskRobAnything, based solely on my own knowledge and integrated it throughout my coaching program, The Self-Running Agency Implementation Group. AskRobAnything is a conversational AI that understands context, provides personalized responses, and can carry out multi-turn conversations as naturally as talking to a human.\n\nIn the program, it augments the support from the real me to provide advice, guidance, and support based on my extensive experience and knowledge.\n\nAskRobAnything helps members navigate the program, answer questions, review work, and provide actionable advice.\n\n2. Which agencies have you mentored in the past, and who are the founders of these agencies?\n\nI've worked with over 450 agencies, so a tough question to answer! Here are a few:\n\n3. What are some of the immediate ways AI is currently impacting agencies?\n\nAI is already making significant impacts on agencies in several ways:\n\n1. Automation of Repetitive Tasks: AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and reporting. This frees up time for your team to focus on more strategic and creative tasks.\n\n2. Enhanced Data Analysis: AI can process and analyze large volumes of data much faster than a human can. This allows agencies to gain deeper insights into their clients' needs and preferences and make data-driven decisions.\n\n3. Improved Customer Service: AI chatbots can handle routine customer queries 24/7, providing instant responses and freeing your customer service team to handle more complex issues.\n\n4. Content Creation: AI can assist in creating content, from writing blog posts to designing graphics. It can also optimise content for SEO, helping to improve your agency's online visibility. And many developers are using it to speed up coding.\n\n5. Predictive Analysis: AI can predict future trends based on historical data, helping agencies to stay ahead of the curve and provide proactive solutions to their clients.\n\nRemember, the goal of AI is not to replace a team but to enhance its capabilities. It's about finding the right balance between human creativity and AI efficiency. I believe that AI can get us from '0-60%' really quickly, and the human then needs to get from '61 -100%'\n\n4. How do you foresee AI transforming the agency landscape in the next 5-10 years?\n\nThe next 5-10 years will be transformative for agencies as AI continues to evolve. Here's how I see it playing out:\n\n1. Advanced Automation: We'll see an increase in the automation of tasks, not just the mundane ones, but also more complex tasks. This will free up agency teams to focus on strategic and creative work.\n\n2. Enhanced Personalisation: AI will enable agencies to deliver highly personalized experiences to their clients' customers through advanced data analysis and predictive modeling. As AI systems become more advanced in understanding consumer behavior and preferences, agencies will likely be able to offer unprecedented levels of personalization in marketing, content, and customer experiences.\n\n3. Improved Decision-Making: AI will provide agencies with deeper insights and more accurate predictions, leading to better decision-making and strategy development.\n\n4. New Services: As AI technology evolves, it will open up new opportunities for agencies to offer innovative services to their clients centered around AI implementation, management, and optimization for clients.\n\n5. Greater Efficiency: With AI handling a lot of the heavy lifting, agencies will be able to operate more strategically and efficiently, delivering better results faster.\n\n6. Upskilling of Staff: As AI takes on more tasks, agency staff will need to upskill and adapt to working alongside AI. This will lead to a shift in the types of roles and skills required in agencies. The agency workforce will likely evolve, with a greater emphasis on AI specialists, data scientists, and professionals who can effectively collaborate with AI systems.\n\n7. Improved ROI Measurement: AI will likely enable more accurate and comprehensive measurement of campaign performance and return on investment across multiple channels.\n\n8. Coaching & Mentoring Support: I believe every agency owner will have their own AI coach, and every team member will have an AI mentor -- available 24/7 and ensuring all team members are supported in the same way with the same content. We will get very used to having our own AI coach -- in agency life (e.g., AskRobAnything)and in our personal lives (e.g., a health coach, fitness coach, food coach, life coach, etc.).\n\nRemember, the goal of AI is not to replace humans but to augment their capabilities. The agencies that will thrive in this new landscape will be those that embrace AI and find the right balance between human creativity and AI efficiency.\n\nAI won't replace agencies, but those agencies that embrace AI will survive and thrive.\n\n5. What are the key benefits that AI brings to agencies in terms of efficiency and performance?\n\nAI brings several key benefits to agencies in terms of efficiency and performance:\n\n1. Time savings: AI automates repetitive tasks, freeing up human workers for more strategic, creative, and high-value activities. This can significantly reduce time spent on mundane tasks.\n\n2. Cost reduction: AI can help agencies reduce operational costs and improve profit margins by automating processes and optimizing resource allocation.\n\n3. Data processing and analysis: AI can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, uncovering insights and patterns that humans might miss. This leads to more informed decision-making.\n\n4. 24/7 operation: AI systems can work around the clock without fatigue, enabling continuous customer service, monitoring, and task execution.\n\n5. Scalability: AI tools allow agencies to handle larger workloads and more clients without a proportional increase in human resources.\n\n6. Consistency: AI performs tasks with high consistency, reducing human error and maintaining quality across large volumes of work.\n\n7. Personalisation at scale: AI enables agencies to simultaneously deliver personalized experiences to large audiences, improving engagement and effectiveness.\n\n8. Predictive capabilities: AI's ability to forecast trends and outcomes helps agencies be more proactive in their strategies and client recommendations.\n\n9. Enhanced creativity: By handling routine tasks, AI allows creative professionals to focus more on ideation and innovation.\n\n10. 24/7 Learning and support: AI coaches provide personalized, 24/7 learning and development support, offering objective feedback, real-time assistance, and data-driven insights to enhance skills, track progress, and guide career paths -- all while scaling across the organization and complementing human mentorship programs.\n\n6. What challenges do agencies face when integrating AI into their operations?\n\nIntegrating AI into agency operations will present some challenges. Here are a few key ones:\n\n1. Technical Complexity: AI systems can be complex to set up and manage. Integrating AI tools into your existing systems and processes requires a certain level of technical expertise. Garbage in = garbage out - so being able to write smart prompts will need to be learned.\n\nSelecting the right AI tools amongst the myriad already available will be a challenge, as will keeping up with rapidly evolving AI technologies.\n\n2. Data Privacy and Security: When using AI, handling sensitive data is a major concern. You need to ensure that your AI tools comply with all relevant data protection laws and that your client's data is secure.\n\n3. Resistance to Change: Like any new technology, there can be resistance to AI from staff who are comfortable with existing processes or fearful of being replaced by machines.\n\n4. Training and Upskilling: Your team will need to learn how to use the AI tools effectively. This might involve some training or upskilling.\n\n5. Cost: While AI can lead to cost savings in the long run, the initial investment can be significant. This includes the cost of the AI tools themselves, as well as the cost of implementation and training.\n\n6. Unrealistic Expectations: AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic bullet. It's important to manage expectations and understand that AI augments your team's capabilities, not replaces them.\n\n7. Can you share an example of an agency that has successfully implemented AI and seen positive results?\n\nAll the members of my agency group, The Self-Running Agency Implementation Group, have access to AskRobAnything and can use it to get support 24/7. They ask questions, get coached, and get feedback on their work.\n\n8. What strategies can agencies use to train their staff and incorporate AI into their daily workflows?\n\nFirstly, an agency needs to decide where AI tools fit in their workflow and have written policies on how and where to use AI. Here are some other strategies to consider:\n\n1. Identify the Skills Gap: Start by identifying the skills your team currently has and what they'll need to work effectively with AI. This will help you understand the training needs of your team.\n\n2. Provide Training: Invest in training programs that can help your team understand and use AI tools effectively. This could be in-house training or external courses. Remember, the training should be ongoing as AI and its applications are continually evolving.\n\n3. Start Small: Don't try to incorporate AI into all aspects of your workflow at once. Start with one or two processes, learn from the experience, and then gradually expand to other areas.\n\n4. Encourage Experimentation: Create a culture where your team feels comfortable experimenting with AI. This will help them learn and adapt more quickly.\n\n5. Use AI Tools that Integrate with Existing Systems: To minimize disruption, choose AI tools that can easily integrate with the systems and processes you already have in place.\n\n6. Set Clear Expectations: Make sure your team understands that the goal of AI is not to replace them but to enhance their capabilities and make their work more efficient and enjoyable.\n\n7. Provide Support: Ensure your team has the support they need as they adapt to AI. This could be technical support or emotional support to manage any anxiety or resistance to change.\n\nIntegrating AI into an agency is not just about the technology, it's also about the people. It's about creating a positive environment where your team feels empowered to use AI to do their best work yet not make them lazy by trying to get AI to do all the heavy lifting!\n\n9. What role do data privacy and ethics play in the adoption of AI by agencies?\n\nData privacy and ethics play a crucial role in the adoption of AI by agencies. Understandably, some agencies today are to embed AI into their agencies until they have all this figured out:\n\n1. Regulatory compliance: Agencies must ensure AI systems comply with data protection regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific laws.\n\n2. Client trust: Maintaining strong data privacy and ethical practices is essential for preserving client relationships and reputation.\n\n3. Transparency: Clear communication about AI use and data handling practices is necessary for both clients and consumers.\n\n4. Ethical decision-making: AI systems often make decisions based on the data they are fed. Ensuring these decisions are made ethically is crucial to avoid bias and unfair practices.\n\n5. Security measures: Strong cybersecurity protocols are essential to protect AI systems and the data they process from breaches.\n\n6. Accountability: Clear chains of responsibility for AI decisions and outcomes need to be established within the agency.\n\n10. Ongoing monitoring: Regular audits and assessments of AI systems are necessary to ensure continued compliance and ethical operation.\n\n10. In what ways can agency partnership programs, such as the Cloudways Agency Partnership Program, support agencies in coping with AI integration?\n\nSponsor my podcasts about AI :-). Provide experts to discuss it. Create blogs like this. Partner on AI webinars.\n\n11. What advice would you give to agency owners who are hesitant about adopting AI due to potential disruptions?\n\nIf you are not investigating the use of AI in your agency, well, your competitor is, and that means they will create work faster, more efficiently, and potentially cheaper than you. So start today. Don't just think about AI as a content creation tool; consider all the other aspects I have outlined.\n\n12.

What if we've been overstating its potential to a frankly dangerous degree? That's the concern of leading cancer experts in the NHS, who warn that the health service is obsessing over new tech to the point that it's putting patient safety at risk. From our story yesterday:\n\nIn a sharply worded warning, the cancer experts say that 'novel solutions' such as new diagnostic tests have been wrongly hyped as 'magic bullets' for the cancer crisis, but 'none address the fundamental issues of cancer as a systems problem'.\n\nA 'common fallacy' of NHS leaders is the assumption that new technologies can reverse inequalities, the authors add. The reality is that tools such as AI can create 'additional barriers for those with poor digital or health literacy'.\n\n'We caution against technocentric approaches without robust evaluation from an equity perspective,' the paper concludes.\n\nPublished in the Lancet Oncology journal, the paper instead argues for a back to basics approach to cancer care. Its proposals focus on solutions like getting more staff, redirecting research to less trendy areas including surgery and radiotherapy, and creating a dedicated unit for technology transfer, ensuring that treatments that have already been proven to work are actually made a part of routine care.\n\nAgainst those much-needed improvements, AI can be an appealing distraction. The promise of the technology is that, within a few short years, a radical capability increase will enable AI technology to do jobs in the health service that can't currently be done, or at least that take up hours of a highly trained specialist's time. And the fear of the experts is that that promise about the future is distracting from changes needed today.\n\nIt effectively casts AI as the latest example of \"bionic duckweed\", a term coined by Stian Westlake in 2020 to cover the use, deliberately or otherwise, of technology that may or may not arrive in the future to argue against investment in the present. Elon Musk's Hyperloop is perhaps the most famous example of bionic duckweed, first proposed more than a decade ago explicitly to try and discourage California from going ahead with plans to construct a high-speed rail line.\n\n(The term comes from a real instance in the wild, in which the UK government was advised against electrifying railways in 2007 because \"we might have ... trains using hydrogen developed from bionic duckweed in 15 years' time ... we might have to take the wires down and it would all be wasted\". Seventeen years on, the UK continues to run diesel engines on non-electrified lines.)\n\nBut the paper's fears about AI - and the general technophilia of the health service - are more than just that it might not arrive. Even if AI does actually start making headway in fighting cancer, without the right groundwork, it may be less useful than it could be.\n\nBack to the piece, a quote from the lead author, oncologist Ajay Aggarwal:\n\nAI is a workflow tool, but actually, is it going to improve survival? Well, we've got limited evidence of that so far. Yes, it's something that could potentially help the workforce, but you still need people to take a patient's history, to take blood, to do surgery, to break bad news.\n\nEven if AI is as good as we hope it will be, in the short term, that might mean little for healthcare in general. Say AI can meaningfully speed up the work of a radiographer, diagnosing cancer earlier or faster after a scan: that means little if there are bottlenecks in the rest of the health service. In the worst-case scenario, you may even see a sort of AI-enabled denial of service attack, with the tech-powered sections of the workflow overwhelming the rest of the system.\n\nIn the long term, AI boosters hope, systems will adapt to incorporate the technology well. (Or, if you're a true believer, then perhaps it's simply a case of waiting until AI can staff a hospital end-to-end.) But in the short term, it's important not to assume that just because AI can do some medical tasks, it can help fix a health system in crisis.\n\nDigital government\n\nLast week we looked at some ideas for what the new government could do around tech, and it's looking good for at least one of those suggestions. New secretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle has been in office for just a few days, but is already hitting my inbox. The DSIT, he says, will:\n\nBecome the centre for digital expertise and delivery in government, improving how the government and public services interact with citizens.\n\nWe will act as a leader and partner across government, with industry and the research communities, to boost Britain's economic performance and power-up our public services to improve the lives and life chances of people through the application of science and technology.\n\nSpecifically, DSIT will \"help to upskill civil servants so they are better at using digital and AI in their frontline work\". Last week, we called on Labour to \"take AI government seriously\"; it looks as if they already are.\n\nDigital colleagues\n\nOn the one hand, look, this is obviously a publicity stunt:\n\nLattice is going to bring an AI employee through all the same processes a human employee goes through when they start a new role.\n\nWe'll be adding them into the employee record and integrating them into our HRIS; we'll be adding them to the org chart so you can see where they fall within a team and department; we will be onboarding the AI employee and ensuring they undergo the training necessary for their role.\n\nAnd we will be assigning goals to this digital worker, to make sure we are holding them accountable to certain standards - just like we would with any other employee. This is going to be a huge learning moment for us, and for the industry.\n\nThat's Sarah Franklin, the chief executive of HR platform Lattice, talking about the company's plans to take an AI employee through all the same steps as a human one. But if you want a peek at what AI success would look like, it's not far off this.\n\nBusinesses are bad at bringing in new technology. If something works well enough, they tend to stick with it for years - decades, even - and it's a huge hurdle to encourage them to switch to a different way of doing things even if the gains seem great.\n\nBut they're much better at bringing in new staff. They have to be: staff quit, retire, have children or die.

For the past decade, automation tools have been assisting with admin tasks in the offices of schools from pre-K to PhD. But now, AI tools like ChatGPT have democratized AI and made it accessible to everyone. Those of us in education are in a period of discovery, learning what AI can do and asking how we can best use AI to solve common problems and create a better educational experience for educators and students alike.\n\nIn a classroom setting, AI can assist in a number of tasks to improve the educational experience. With its ability to distill massive amounts of information and generate content quickly, AI could improve the educational process in a myriad of ways. It may be able to help challenged students catch up to their peers and already-strong students excel even further by allowing them to create their own practice exercises, study guides and outlines. It could personalize learning materials to skill level, interest or time to completion.\n\nAI can also serve as an after-hours teaching assistant. As a parent of kids who are active both academically and athletically, I appreciate that school days can stretch late into the night. AI has the potential to support students during these hours by answering their questions. Instructors could upload their class materials into a specialized AI model, training it to become an expert on a specific book or subject. Once trained, students could interact with the AI like a chatbot, posing questions they might typically ask their teacher during class or office hours. The AI, programmed to understand the material, could guide students without simply providing answers by breaking down complex questions into smaller, manageable parts or walk students through solving problems, much like a tutor. This innovation could make education accessible anytime and anywhere, overcoming technological and geographical barriers.\n\nFor instructors, AI could provide a wealth of services to make their jobs easier. It could help them to ramp up faster when teaching new classes and unfamiliar subject matter by providing a syllabus, topics and notes with the most current information available in seconds. It could create practice exams and worksheets to complement what is being taught in the classroom. We are only beginning to understand AI's capabilities.\n\nDespite these benefits, teachers and educators are understandably worried about privacy, plagiarism and making sure their students are actually learning -- not just using AI to cheat on their assignments.\n\nFortunately, there are multiple safeguards already in place to ensure privacy and protect against plagiarism. While not always accurate and still evolving, plagiarism checkers and AI content detectors can help teachers verify that student work is original and not AI-generated. Every time a new AI detector comes out, the AI generators are learning to get better to beat the detectors. It's a vicious cycle, each making the other work harder.\n\nPrivacy concerns can be assuaged by using the right tool for the job. Private AI tools use private information uploaded into the system as well as public information to generate content, but it is not accessible to just anyone. Public AI such as ChatGPT uses what it can find on the internet as well as all the information previously entered into it to generate results, which means everything uploaded into the system becomes publicly accessible. As long as educators are using private AI tools with safety features built in, privacy should be less of a concern.\n\nThere is no turning back now. The AI revolution is here. Instead of fearing AI in education, we have the opportunity to embrace the improvements that AI can make for both teacher and student educational experiences. We can teach AI prompt-writing in schools, along with AI ethics and the proper use and citation of AI tools in education. We have a responsibility to teach students how to use it correctly so it enhances their learning experience, because AI is here to stay.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

As applications now proliferate across industries like science, medicine, and technology, Goertzel says AI aligns with the goals of transhumanism due to the movement's reliance on advanced technologies to create significant change.\n\n\"We have more data about different levels of the human body and different organisms than any human mind can understand, and biostatistics struggle, standard machine learning struggles,\" Goertzel said. \"So the more advanced your AI gets, the better you can integrate together all the diverse biology data out there, and you can then use AI for hypothesis generation.\"\n\nGoertzel pointed to nanotechnology as an area in which AI could make greater strides than humans.\n\n\"AI is way better at designing stuff at the nano-scale, or the femto-scale beyond that, than humans are,\" he said. \"We have a lot of practical know-how about how to hammer and nail stuff together at the scale where we intuitively understand the physics, but we don't have a good intuition for nano-scale or femto-scale physics, and AI can deal with that just as well as the scale that we're at now.\"\n\nTranshumanism in action\n\n\"Look at brain-computer interfacing; how do you decode the signals coming out of the brain? AI can be very helpful for coding the basic coding language in different parts of the brain used to describe things,\" Goertzel said, noting AI being optimized for retail and manufacturing.\n\nA brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that enables direct communication between the brain and an external device, often allowing control of computers or prosthetics through neural signals. Companies currently working in this field of neuroscience and biotechnology include San Francisco-based Neuralink, Emotiv, and Halo Neuroscience.\n\n\"There are many different applications that can be enhanced by AI,\" he added. \"Then of course, once you get to AGI, you could have the AI coordinating all these different particular AI applications.\"\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a type of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in the same way a human can.\n\nIs transhumanism only for the rich?\n\nDetractors of transhumanism say the movement is \"playing God\" or is a replacement for religion, and that the only ones who will benefit from the merging of humanity with technology will be the wealthy and elites. To be sure, the cost of longevity and transhuman research is high.\n\nGoertzel said this won't always be the case, and said more efforts should be made to provide wider and equal access.\n\n\"These little mobile supercomputers we all carry around have not only benefited the rich,\" Goertzel said, noting that his organization works with software developers in Ethiopia.\n\n\"We have 50 software developers working for SingularityNET, and every one of the kids who is coding for us there has a smartphone. Even if you go to a rural village in Sub-Saharan Africa, everyone has feature phones. They use them to keep in touch with their family and to check the city prices for various agricultural commodities they sell.\"\n\nGoertzel also emphasized the role of blockchain and cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the upcoming Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ASI token in lowering cost and access to human-enhancing technology.\n\n\"In theory, the blockchain and cryptocurrency worlds can be helpful in combating those issues by creating a parallel economic system that's not tied down by the legacy economic systems,\" he said. \"In practice, that's a challenge, because many governments outlaw crypto then.\"\n\nAnother issue Goertzel highlighted is groups and entities hoarding cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Crypto markets themselves become dominated by token whales, which is their own emergent elite,\" he said. \"So that's an important thing to worry about and work against. But yet, it's not obvious that transhumanist technologies make this phenomenon any worse than it is now.\"\n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhile Goertzel champions transhumanism and artificial intelligence, he acknowledged there should be limitations to what research should be done.\n\n\"We can't say there are no limitations that should be put on research,\" he said. \"Clearly, there is a line beyond which, as a society that cares about its members not all being killed -- there's some research that you want to slow down or not permit.\"\n\nNoting that laws are already being developed with such limits in mind, Goertzel said the best path forward is determining how to apply these technologies for the common good as AI and cybernetics becoming more advanced and common.\n\n\"I don't think attempts to ban AI are gonna help whatsoever because AI is providing too much useful value to too many people, too many businesses,\" he said. \"There's not that much precedent for a free society banning things that are useful to everyone. And I think in the end, the same will be true of transhuman-oriented technologies.\"", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_nelson@decrypt.co", "name": "Jason Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Goertzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transhumanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neuralink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\u2013computer_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain\u2013computer interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanity+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanity+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Huxley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Huxley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aldous Huxley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk 2077"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhuman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brave New World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cybernetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bionics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dr-Ben-Goertzel-SingularityNET-gID_7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

What if we've been overstating its potential to a frankly dangerous degree? That's the concern of leading cancer experts in the NHS, who warn that the health service is obsessing over new tech to the point that it's putting patient safety at risk. From our story yesterday:\n\nIn a sharply worded warning, the cancer experts say that 'novel solutions' such as new diagnostic tests have been wrongly hyped as 'magic bullets' for the cancer crisis, but 'none address the fundamental issues of cancer as a systems problem'.\n\nA 'common fallacy' of NHS leaders is the assumption that new technologies can reverse inequalities, the authors add. The reality is that tools such as AI can create 'additional barriers for those with poor digital or health literacy'.\n\n'We caution against technocentric approaches without robust evaluation from an equity perspective,' the paper concludes.\n\nPublished in the Lancet Oncology journal, the paper instead argues for a back to basics approach to cancer care. Its proposals focus on solutions like getting more staff, redirecting research to less trendy areas including surgery and radiotherapy, and creating a dedicated unit for technology transfer, ensuring that treatments that have already been proven to work are actually made a part of routine care.\n\nAgainst those much-needed improvements, AI can be an appealing distraction. The promise of the technology is that, within a few short years, a radical capability increase will enable AI technology to do jobs in the health service that can't currently be done, or at least that take up hours of a highly trained specialist's time. And the fear of the experts is that that promise about the future is distracting from changes needed today.\n\nIt effectively casts AI as the latest example of \"bionic duckweed\", a term coined by Stian Westlake in 2020 to cover the use, deliberately or otherwise, of technology that may or may not arrive in the future to argue against investment in the present. Elon Musk's Hyperloop is perhaps the most famous example of bionic duckweed, first proposed more than a decade ago explicitly to try and discourage California from going ahead with plans to construct a high-speed rail line.\n\n(The term comes from a real instance in the wild, in which the UK government was advised against electrifying railways in 2007 because \"we might have ... trains using hydrogen developed from bionic duckweed in 15 years' time ... we might have to take the wires down and it would all be wasted\". Seventeen years on, the UK continues to run diesel engines on non-electrified lines.)\n\nBut the paper's fears about AI - and the general technophilia of the health service - are more than just that it might not arrive. Even if AI does actually start making headway in fighting cancer, without the right groundwork, it may be less useful than it could be.\n\nBack to the piece, a quote from the lead author, oncologist Ajay Aggarwal:\n\nAI is a workflow tool, but actually, is it going to improve survival? Well, we've got limited evidence of that so far. Yes, it's something that could potentially help the workforce, but you still need people to take a patient's history, to take blood, to do surgery, to break bad news.\n\nEven if AI is as good as we hope it will be, in the short term, that might mean little for healthcare in general. Say AI can meaningfully speed up the work of a radiographer, diagnosing cancer earlier or faster after a scan: that means little if there are bottlenecks in the rest of the health service. In the worst-case scenario, you may even see a sort of AI-enabled denial of service attack, with the tech-powered sections of the workflow overwhelming the rest of the system.\n\nIn the long term, AI boosters hope, systems will adapt to incorporate the technology well. (Or, if you're a true believer, then perhaps it's simply a case of waiting until AI can staff a hospital end-to-end.) But in the short term, it's important not to assume that just because AI can do some medical tasks, it can help fix a health system in crisis.\n\nLast week we looked at some ideas for what the new government could do around tech, and it's looking good for at least one of those suggestions. New secretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle has been in office for just a few days, but is already hitting my inbox. The DSIT, he says, will:\n\nBecome the centre for digital expertise and delivery in government, improving how the government and public services interact with citizens.\n\nWe will act as a leader and partner across government, with industry and the research communities, to boost Britain's economic performance and power-up our public services to improve the lives and life chances of people through the application of science and technology.\n\nSpecifically, DSIT will \"help to upskill civil servants so they are better at using digital and AI in their frontline work\". Last week, we called on Labour to \"take AI government seriously\"; it looks as if they already are.\n\nOn the one hand, look, this is obviously a publicity stunt:\n\nLattice is going to bring an AI employee through all the same processes a human employee goes through when they start a new role.\n\nWe'll be adding them into the employee record and integrating them into our HRIS; we'll be adding them to the org chart so you can see where they fall within a team and department; we will be onboarding the AI employee and ensuring they undergo the training necessary for their role.\n\nAnd we will be assigning goals to this digital worker, to make sure we are holding them accountable to certain standards - just like we would with any other employee. This is going to be a huge learning moment for us, and for the industry.\n\nThat's Sarah Franklin, the chief executive of HR platform Lattice, talking about the company's plans to take an AI employee through all the same steps as a human one. But if you want a peek at what AI success would look like, it's not far off this.\n\nBusinesses are bad at bringing in new technology. If something works well enough, they tend to stick with it for years - decades, even - and it's a huge hurdle to encourage them to switch to a different way of doing things even if the gains seem great.\n\nBut they're much better at bringing in new staff. They have to be: staff quit, retire, have children or die. If you can adapt the process of bringing in an AI worker to be more like the latter, and less like the former, you may well end up greatly expanding the pool of businesses who feel like they can deploy AI in their own world.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hern@theguardian.com", "name": "Alex Hern", "type":

Join an AI consultancy or start up your own. Meet potential clients, find out their business challenges, then research the solutions and advise on what they do. This role requires you're a hungry learner, eager self-starter, who can explain complex things in a simple way.\n\nAverage salary: top earners are earning around $155,500 per year.\n\nAn AI startup founder creates and leads a company focused on developing and commercializing AI technologies. While they might not take cash out straight away, the potential for high earnings is there, through dividends, salary and company valuation.\n\nSuccessful AI startups can attract investment and be acquired for high multiples, often around 20x annual revenue or more, depending on the innovation and market impact of the technology. High-profile exits can result in substantial financial rewards for founders.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that you don't have to start an AI business to win big in an AI career. You could join an AI startup. Top AI companies share specific roles on their own websites, and some of the salary and compensation packages dwarf all of those mentioned above, especially if you join at the start and take equity as part of your package.\n\nAverage salary: Potential earnings can be substantial, whether you own the company or join it early on.\n\nIf you're thinking about a change and you want to earn more, a career in AI could be the one. Dig into these roles, find out what you need and get reskilling or upskilling.\n\nThe ship hasn't sailed, there's plenty of time to get your foot in the door and start carving out your future as a big earner.

By failing to act to address this AI skills and leadership vacuum organizations could be taking a significant risk.\n\nWe spoke to Arun 'Rak' Ramchandran, president and global head -- GenAI consulting and practice, hi-tech and professional services at Hexaware, to find out more about the problem and how it can be tackled.\n\nBN: What is the biggest challenge facing businesses as they look to experiment with AI adoption?\n\nAR: Organisations are facing many issues when it comes to AI adoption, including security concerns, regulatory non-compliance, data bias, and hallucinations. These challenges not only limit the potential benefits of AI but also raise the possibility of financial or reputational damage. There are also challenges related to well-defined business metrics and Return On Investment (ROI), the readiness of enterprise data to be monetized, and handling change management in terms of workflows and organizational roles.\n\nBut arguably the biggest issue for many businesses, and linked to all the above, is the lack of AI skills and a leadership vacuum. This shortage is a real concern, considering recent studies show that one in six UK organizations have already deployed AI. With so much deployment underway, there is a real risk that without the right expertise or oversight, organizations could make costly mistakes and bloated investments.\n\nToo often, businesses are finding they do not have the required skills, expertise, and accountability to fully benefit from AI. As a result, many AI deployments are not delivering as expected, with models generating outputs that cannot be put to use and flawed decision-making. Enterprises are then unable to spot these issues as they lack the expertise to understand what could be going wrong. In a nutshell, organizations are jumping on the AI bandwagon without fully thinking through all the practicalities of what AI entails.\n\nBN: How widespread is the AI skills and leadership vacuum?\n\nAR: This vacuum presents a widespread challenge affecting many organizations. Whether they are in finance or manufacturing, it does not matter. Businesses across different industries are finding it difficult to obtain the right skills to benefit from this technology.\n\nLinkedIn's Future of Work Report reveals the extent of this problem -- as it reports a 21-fold increase in the amount of AI-related vacancies between November 2022 and August 2023. Whilst demand for AI talent will inevitability increase in line with deployments, it appears that many organizations are finding it hard to fill these roles. AWS found that almost three-quarters of UK businesses are struggling to find the AI talent they need.\n\nEnterprises are also struggling to get the right leadership in place. This is causing a major headache as AI investments are being ramped up without someone in place to oversee them. One report finds that just over one in ten firms have appointed a chief AI officer, signaling a significant shortfall in AI leadership. Even if businesses can recruit technical AI skills by offering compelling salaries, these investments could be frittered away without the correct direction or leadership in place.\n\nBN: So, what risks does this vacuum create for organisations?\n\nAR: Since AI is still in an experimental stage, it is important businesses realize they could land themselves in trouble without the required skills or leadership in place. These elements will make it possible to have a clear game plan spelling out how AI can add value in the long term.\n\nAdditionally, there are challenges with setting clear business goals and ROI for AI projects, readying data for monetization, and adjusting workflows and organizational roles.\n\nWorse still is the potential for regulatory non-compliance, IP leakage, or lasting reputational damage. This could be the result of employees tuning the model incorrectly or unintentionally letting biases creep into data. There could also be serious repercussions if staff fail to adjust for objectionable or non-compliant outputs or inadvertently mishandle sensitive data due to a lack of proper AI guardrails, governance, and oversight.\n\nWith so much at stake, organizations must not progress with AI deployments unless they have a clear view of what could go wrong. This approach risks leaving companies blind and vulnerable to the point of no return -- where damage is spotted far too late before anything can be rectified. The sooner enterprises get the right leadership and skills in place, the better as they can start to have a watertight plan that addresses every aspect of AI. This is critical given the continuing emergence of new AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act.\n\nBN: What steps can businesses take to address this gap?\n\nAR: To address the skill and leadership gap created by the rapid integration of Generative AI (Gen AI), businesses can take several steps. First, it is crucial to identify and cultivate AI leaders who blend deep technical understanding with strong governance and interpersonal skills. Such leaders should not only be proficient in AI technologies, but also adept in managing change and guiding teams.\n\nTraining existing leaders can be a highly effective strategy. Many organizations might benefit from upskilling an existing executive who already understands the company's culture and business strategy. This approach uses their existing organizational knowledge while filling gaps in their AI expertise. It is essential, however, that these leaders receive comprehensive training in AI-specific skills, such as prompt engineering and system maintenance, to ensure they can manage the technical demands of AI projects.\n\nAlso, according to the Alan Turing Institute, successful AI leadership requires the capability to bridge the gap between technical and business units, facilitating communication and collaboration. This helps integrate AI solutions in a way that supports business objectives and minimizes disruption to existing processes.\n\nFinally, to capitalize on the transformative potential of Gen AI, businesses should proactively create roles that cater to emerging needs -- like prompt engineers, large language model ops, visual designers, and content creators. These roles not only accommodate the new technology but also inject vitality into the tech sector, ensuring that the workforce evolves in tandem with technological advancements. By taking these steps, companies can mitigate the impact of the skills gap and align Gen AI deployments with long-term business goals.\n\nBN: Do you have any other advice leaders should bear in mind to capitalise on the power of AI?\n\nAR: 2023 was the year the world began to understand the true capabilities of Gen AI. It is safe to say that most organizations, including the creators, do not fully comprehend its future potential, or likely risks. It is also a good assumption that there will be an increase in the capabilities of Gen AI over time. Gen AI, coupled with traditional AI, is already proliferating with industry use cases that offer real quantifiable value and will open myriad opportunities. These opportunities will center around companies becoming more productive, enhancing growth, and creating new disruptive business models.\n\nWith most organizations already moving forward with AI, the time to act is now. The stakes are too high to engage in AI without proper leadership, talent, and a clear strategic vision. If they do not have all of the pieces of the puzzle to hand, organizations should draw on the technical expertise of an external services partner well-versed in AI technologies. The benefit of doing this is twofold. Not only could companies supplement the soft skills of their transitioned leaders with the technical expertise of the external organization, but they could also use that partnership to train and upskill the wider workforce. This has the added advantage of negating the need to recruit and onboard specialist AI talent at the last minute. Combined with a clear plan of how AI will deliver clear business benefits, it is this action that will drive better, strategic decision-making, whilst leveraging the existing knowledge and value of their own employees.", "source": {"uri": "betanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_barker@betanews.com", "name": "Ian Barker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Nasional", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barisan Nasional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vacuum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandwagon effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Change management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Skills-gap.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

As companies transition to AI, what should CIOs be doing to prepare their organizations?\n\nThe Health Management Academy has defined five levels of AI maturity in healthcare:\n\nLevel 5 - AI is transformative and has become part of an organization's DNA.\n\nWhen academy members asked medical and technology practitioners where they felt their organizations were in the AI maturity curve, most selected Level 2 - AI experimentation.\n\nI've found similar results in other industry sectors.\n\nIt's also clear that it will be up to CIOs to shoulder major responsibilities for AI deployment, whether the AI comes into the company through a dedicated data science department, or through a user function. Why? Because only IT has a comprehensive, enterprise-wide knowledge of data, applications and infrastructure, and how AI could affect them.\n\nSince most organizations are still in AI tire-kicking stages, and really don't know what the ultimate outcomes of AI will be, it falls on CIOs to think though the challenges and opportunities of deployment as AI becomes an organizational reality.\n\n1. Evaluate your existing data and IT architectures.\n\nAI functions best when the data it operates on exists in a data repository, and the data in the repository is of high quality and can interoperate with other data types. It takes time to achieve and maintain high quality, interoperable data. The process begins with using ETL (extract-transform-load) tools that can pull data from a wide range of on- and off-premises sources, clean it, and standardize it so it can interoperate with the types of data in the single data repository that AI will use.\n\nThis process impacts IT infrastructure because it involves a number of systems that may not be well integrated with each other. Systems outside of the enterprise that are owned and operated by third parties must be vetted for data compatibility, and also for conformance with security and governance standards.\n\nOn the network side, bandwidth may need to be increased, and network traffic and deployment patterns may need to be reworked. In storage, more storage certainly will be needed, and data backup and recovery schemes will need be established for AI.\n\nIn processing, adjustments must be made for parallel stream processing that is a departure from the linear processing used for everyday IT transactions.\n\nThis is a lot of information to unpack. It will affect how IT operates, and it will demand new data management, processing and strategic skills that IT may not have.\n\n2. Evaluate your skill levels.\n\nMost IT staff members will require up-skilling for AI.\n\nStaffers may need to learn new programming languages, and technical IT support in the data center will have to master a parallel processing environment. The networking staff must provision additional bandwidth and faster throughput for AI, and most likely will develop a dedicated network.\n\nApplications and business analyst groups will need to learn the mechanics of AI application building. This begins with defining algorithms, building learning models for machine learning, and progressing to iterative QA testing until the AI outcomes are within 95% accuracy of what subject matter experts would conclude. On the user side, subject matter experts need to be recruited for assistance in developing algorithms.\n\n3. Set compliance and governance guidelines.\n\nCompanies, regulators and governments are just beginning to get their arms around AI compliance and governance. So, it is falling to companies to define their own guidelines.\n\nAs AI matures, there will be incidents and use cases that dictate regulation, and these regulations will be written. in the meantime, the goal for IT is to avoid being in one of these incidents or use cases.\n\n4. Evaluate user acceptance.\n\nEmployee resistance is a major cause of project failure, and employees will be resistant if they believe that AI will take their jobs away. The solution is to develop a human roadmap so that individuals know upfront where they and their responsibilities are likely to evolve. In the event that jobs may be eliminated, it's best to let employees know this upfront, and to assist them in finding other work.\n\nAI is a major security risk because IT security solutions are designed for standard, transactional IT, not big data.\n\nOne growing AI security threat is \"poisoned data in which trawled data for deep-learning training is compromised with intentional malicious information.\" The data gets compromised, and the results that the AI derives from it are purposefully false and misleading.\n\nA second risk is the degradation of AI results over time. This happens when business and other conditions change, but the algorithms querying the data or the data itself don't keep up with the rate of change. IT and end users must develop maintenance strategies for AI systems that continuously monitor for accuracy and flag declining accuracy levels so IT and end users can make the necessary adjustments to regain accuracy.\n\n6. Stop being experimental.\n\nMost AI systems are still in pilot stages, but now is the time to pursue the right methodologies, technology deployments and staff skill upgrades before AI moves to production.\n\nAI in production (and ultimately in company DNA) is a certainty. It's not too soon to start rethinking and redeploying IT operations, methods and skillsets to be ready for it.", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interoperability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IT infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data type"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parallel computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stream processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extract, transform, load"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Programming language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iteration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blt1ac1cd0614dd1439/668586772deff1f45d529147/BFFFBM.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

As noted by Hackett, this AI revolution has led to all sorts of companies taking an interest in utilising the tech, either internally or as part of their software offering.\n\n\"We've gone from AI almost being a 'nice to have' to a 'need to have' while developing software.\"\n\nHackett is a cloud consultant at Red Hat, where he helps customers utilise AI technology. He joined the company in 2020 as a graduate solution architect after completing a technology management degree at the National College of Ireland.\n\n\"My final year project focused on using machine learning to predict the stock market,\" he says. \"I still work for a living so it wasn't as predictable as I had hoped!\"\n\nResistance to change\n\nWith AI becoming as popular as it continues to be, Hackett recognises the dual presence of excitement and fear in people's minds - particularly in the workforce, as worries of AI replacing human jobs remain frequent. However, he thinks that this is a \"perception issue\" and that ultimately, people are \"frightened of the unknown\", drawing comparisons between the emergence of AI and other innovations such as the introduction of computer text editors, which replaced the need for typewriting skills in office settings.\n\nThe understandable AI-driven uneasiness experienced by the workforce is something Hackett says companies will need to overturn through honesty and openness if they want to introduce AI tools.\n\n\"A lot of resistance can come from not knowing the purpose of an AI tool or system that is being brought in. This can lead to people making negative assumptions and slow down uptake in the tool or system,\" he says.\n\n\"If leadership teams can present AI as a force for good within an organisation and try to bring people along on the journey, it can lead to buy-in from teams. Organisations need to approach AI tooling as something that can improve their employees' quality of life and not just something that can affect the bottom line.\"\n\nThe little AI that should\n\nWhen it comes to the actual integration of AI tools, Hackett says there are two major pitfalls that he sees organisations make; unnecessary deployment and generic tools.\n\nWhen it comes to the first issue, Hackett sums it up simply; \"Just because AI can do it, doesn't mean it should.\n\n\"I've seen AI be used to solve a number of problems over the last few years and it reminds me of the saying 'using a sledgehammer to crack a nut'. Many companies get hyped over AI and want to show progress so they use the technology to deal with a matter that could have been easily solved by just doing traditional software development.\"\n\nHe says that he also sees a lot of companies buying and deploying AI tools that can do \"generic\" jobs, but are lacklustre when it comes to specialised tasks. \"Most organisations struggle to list solid use cases that can deliver value in their organisations and as a result they go to the 101 of AI deployment and build something generic like an LLM-based internal chatbot.\n\n\"While it's great to see organisations try AI and invest in the technology, generic approaches won't return the value that you need to show to a board.\"\n\nHackett suggests that companies should look to AI for fixing a specific problem that is too complicated to solve with traditional tech capabilities, or perhaps use AI as a second pair of eyes for peer review in the software development process, as he has witnessed a number of times.\n\nHe says that companies should always start with a small idea and deploy a cross-functional team to work with it and think strategically. \"An AI tool that delivers immense and immediate value to even a small group of people can often deliver a lot more value than an overarching generic tool that tries to be a jack of all trades.\"\n\nBe responsible\n\nAs well as the strategic considerations that a company must keep in mind when venturing into AI territory, Hackett emphasises the importance of using the tech responsibly and ethically.\n\n\"A quick gut check is necessary from the get-go,\" he says. \"Would you like your personal data used in this manner? If it makes you uncomfortable then you probably need to examine your AI idea or project with a bit more rigour.\n\n\"A more formal approach would be to develop an internal organisation-wide strategy addressing the acceptable use cases of AI. You can use legislation such as the EU AI Act as a good baseline.\"\n\nHe also suggests the use of tools that can detect and mitigate bias in AI models, such as open-source projects like TrustyAI.\n\nAt the end of the day, Hackett notes that AI isn't a solution for every problem, but if used correctly and appropriately it can make a \"huge\" difference.\n\n\"Start small and ask the right questions, is this something we need to do with AI or can we do this with something else? Build a scalable framework for developing AI internally within your organisation, and make sure the controls are in place so that the data being used for AI is acceptable and ethical.\"\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not new, the AI landscape changed drastically with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThis chatbot and the LLMs (large language models) behind it - and the newer versions of the LLMs that followed - transformed AI from a tool used only by specialized technologists and data scientists into a tool that can be accessed by everyone.\n\nIn the process, it unleashed a technological revolution that will be, at the very least, as disruptive as the Internet - and many believe it will be much more disruptive. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai claims that AI will have a deeper effect on humanity 'than electricity or fire', while Microsoft's Satya Nadella believes that Generative AI represents the 'first time a technology developed in Silicon Valley brings benefits to the lives of ordinary people so quickly and so tangibly'.\n\nThe Impact of Generative AI on companies\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI is expected to have a huge impact on businesses. Goldman Sachs projects that Generative AI has the potential to increase annual labor productivity by approximately 1.5% points over 10 years and lead to a 7% increase in global GDP.\n\nMcKinsey is equally optimistic. According to research conducted by the company, Generative AI could add the equivalent of US$2.6 trillion to US$4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases analyzed. The company also noted that this estimate would almost double if it included the impact of integrating Generative AI into software currently used for other tasks not analyzed.\n\nNew use cases and new tools are emerging practically every day, but below are some of the most interesting uses of Generative AI happening today in the financial, healthcare, government and industrial sectors.\n\nUse cases of AI in financial services and banking\n\nThe financial services sector is typically quick to adopt technologies that can improve processes and services because small gains in speed and efficiency can produce large returns. Across the segment, Generative AI has been evaluated or used in a variety of processes, from improving loan and credit risk assessment to managing regulatory compliance, detecting fraud or enhancing customer service.\n\nFor example, the latest iteration of the Visa Account Attack Intelligence (VAAI) Score uses Generative AI to assess more than 180 risk attributes in milliseconds and generates a score predicting the likelihood of a bot-assisted brute force card fraud. Visa is developing a Generative AI model to combat card testing fraud. The AI-enabled VAAI Score has six times more fraud detection capabilities than previous models and has reduced the false-positive rate by 85%.\n\nFinancial services companies also see potential in Generative AI to improve customer service and decision-making. Bank of America recently introduced an AI-enabled virtual assistant, Erica, to provide customers with personalized financial guidance. Capital One is taking a similar approach with Eno, an AI-enabled natural language SMS assistant.\n\nGenerative AI is also helping financial services companies navigate the complex regulatory environment. Compliance management software providers are integrating Generative AI and Machine Learning into their platforms to analyze regulatory rules, policies, and procedures and identify and assess compliance risks.\n\nUse cases of AI in healthcare\n\nHealthcare has been one of the primary beneficiaries of AI with use cases going beyond pharmaceutical development and patient care. AI is being used to automate administrative tasks, improve image analysis, assist in diagnostics, and develop personalized care programs.\n\nOne of the most exciting use cases is drug discovery and testing. Generative AI can accelerate the process of identifying compounds for new drugs and the speed of their development. A study by the Boston Consulting Group found that AI can reduce drug development and testing costs and time by 25 to 50%, enabling life-saving and life-changing medications to reach the market faster.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nResearchers at MIT used AI to analyze over 100 million chemical compounds, leading to the development of Halicin, an antibiotic that proved effective against various strains of bacteria resistant to existing antibiotics.\n\nInsilico used its AI platform to generate and optimize INS18_055, developed to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a type of lung disease. Now in clinical trials, the drug was developed in just 18 months from target identification to designation as a preclinical candidate.\n\nBiotechnology company Recursion used AI on biological image data to identify more than 20 new drugs to be investigated for genetic and ageing-related diseases, many of which are now in clinical trials.\n\nUse cases of AI in the government sector\n\nThe government sector could become one of the largest users of AI due to the immense amount of data it handles daily and the multitude of citizens it serves.\n\nWithin the US federal government, AI use cases were emerging so rapidly that a database was created to track them. This database now includes more than 700 examples of how departments and agencies are using AI, including analyzing urban heat islands to better protect residents against extreme weather conditions, analyzing unstructured feedback from military veterans to improve service delivery, and speeding up the process of comparing new patent applications with existing patents.\n\nIn Argentina, the Ministry of Health is using AI to predict the spread of diseases like dengue based on climate data and population flows. Locally, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Buenos Aires worked with the AI lab at the University of Buenos Aires to develop Prometea, an AI virtual assistant that helps speed up judicial work.\n\nUse cases of AI in the industrial sector\n\nIndustry has already greatly benefited from AI and other advanced technologies, and Generative AI will enable greater efficiencies and better quality. AI is being used to accelerate product design and development, monitor quality, and increase the accuracy of production planning and inventory management.\n\nGeneral Motors uses AI-enabled generative design to drive continuous improvements in vehicle components, focusing on lightweighting. In collaboration with AutoDesk, GM engineers were able to quickly evaluate more than 150 different designs for a seat bracket and generate a design that simplified manufacturing while reducing weight by 40% and increasing strength by 20%.\n\nAirbus had a similar experience with generative design, using it to create lighter partitions for the A320. It used Generative AI algorithms based on growth patterns found in nature to optimize the structure of the partitions. The resulting 'bionic partition' is 45% lighter than traditional designs while meeting strict requirements for stress and displacement due to impact forces.\n\nIn factories, Generative AI is being used to increase production uptime and reduce service costs. AI models can be trained with data from equipment sensors and recognize patterns in this data that may indicate an impending failure. AI is also being used to analyze historical maintenance data to help identify and resolve issues and analyze failures.\n\nPreparing for the AI Revolution\n\nThe question is not if AI will come to your company, but when - if it is not already there. As you get excited about AI's potential in your organization, it is important to identify the changes that will be needed to enable the AI journey and maximize the return on investment (ROI) in all your AI use cases.", "source": {"uri": "intelligentcio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intelligent CIO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For any brand with a broad presence and countless localized consumer touchpoints, it looks like a lot to manage. But it's possible for marketers not only to sidestep these risks, but to do so easily, by implementing AI incrementally and transparently.\n\nHigh-profile AI blunders -- and cases of AI done right\n\nWhen generative AI hit the mainstream in the form of tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney, major tech businesses were eager to position themselves as tech trailblazers. But soon, high-profile AI blunders appeared, which now serve as cautionary tales. To wit: MSN ran a clearly AI-generated obituary for a professional basketball player, with mangled phrasing and an inappropriate tone. It scored considerable bad press for MSN. Famously, a New York Times reporter manipulated Bing's AI chatbot to tell him it loved him - not a good look for the AI's trustworthiness. Some sites -- particularly those that rely heavily on SEO for traffic -- have been called out for running variations on the same headline. And while Google has said generative AI content can be used as long as it's not written just to rank, the company has struggled to distinguish good content from great.\n\nMeanwhile, other leading businesses have taken steps to respect the user experience, and to soften any reputational effects of their AI tools' current blind spots. Google tells the consumer its implementation of AI is experimental, and the consumer needs to opt into using it. Meta launched an experience where users can interact with AI versions of celebrities -- including one where Snoop Dogg portrays a Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master, answering only questions about Dungeons and Dragons. This way, Snoop's own brand is protected by narrow guardrails from having inappropriate words put in his mouth.\n\nRealistically, brand voice can be managed easily in AI applications, as long as the brand can feed the AI a large volume of language in that voice. But understanding company policy is another story. What if a consumer raises a complaint to an AI chatbot, and the chatbot offers a $10 discount, but that's not company policy? Such missteps could become a real PR issue when the consumer decides to take their experience to social media.\n\nMarketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Roman Gun, Vice President, Product @ Zeta Global\n\nBrands can fill in consumers' AI knowledge gaps\n\nWhen the results of SOCi's 2024 Consumer Behavior Index (CBI) were unveiled, it became clear that the share of consumers who say they feel well-informed about AI (61%) is greater than the share who say they've used AI tools (31%). Basically, they're not getting their information from direct experience alone, but from news coverage and word of mouth. Some of that news is accurate and well-contextualized. Some of it sensationalistic or over-simplified. And however reliable the information, the typical consumer isn't actually obligated to follow AI trends closely.\n\nSavvy brands can turn AI into an educational opportunity for their consumers, and correct consumers' misunderstandings about the technology. Simultaneously, brands can learn from their own relationships with consumers, to understand what kinds of AI experiences enhance which consumer touchpoints. Consumer-facing AI tools are varied in their levels of sophistication, but they always need to provide a useful experience and do what they're intended to do. If the consumer simply wants a question answered, for example, but customer service AI tries to sell or upsell them a product or service, that's poor UX, and the brand needs to amend how the AI functions at that touchpoint.\n\nBrands need a transparency checklist\n\nConsumers want brands to be transparent in how they use AI in local marketing. This is complicated for brands, though, because the type of disclosures they provide can vary even on a site-by-site or app-by-app basis. Yet disclosures are a must. Transparency means that the consumer must be informed of when and how they are interacting with AI. And UX must be carefully considered and trialed.\n\nLet's consider how tech giants have historically approached disclosures. Apple offers a long list of terms and conditions upfront, which consumers tend to trust and accept. Then users can control location-sharing in apps on a case-by-case basis. Facebook permits users to either allow or deny permissions to countless advertisers - but those advertisers must be selected one at a time. These are two very different forms of disclosures and permissions, but they're both valid and compliant.\n\nDon't expect government regulators to step in and issue guidelines for AI transparency anytime soon. As recent congressional hearings with tech executives have shown, legislators are generally not AI experts. But your brand needs a consistent compliance policy, regardless. One crucial task for the brand is to understand the kind of questions their consumers will be asking AI tools -- and to locate and accurately respond to consumer comments, reviews, and questions, anywhere on the web that need feedback from the business.\n\nNext steps for providing AI clarity and guidance to consumers\n\nOnly the largest brands have the internal resources to become AI experts. Any business's top responsibility is to be the best at their core product or service, not to optimize UX and performance of AI tools. And most brands will need partnership from a provider that deeply understands AI. Remember that whenever your business starts using new AI tools, the output won't be perfect right away. Trial them using a small sample size, and get a feedback loop running using data from opted-in early adopters. Make consumers aware of the value exchange with these tools: This deepens consumer trust and draws input that can continuously train the AI. These efforts will help minimize inaccurate, biased and off-brand AI output.\n\nIt's important to point out that consumers will appreciate AI's efficiency and capacity for remembering preferences -- if they don't perceive the AI as \"creepy,\" wrong, or annoying. And while generative AI tech is improving, AI doesn't \"think,\" doesn't have any intentions of its own, and needs human oversight. To keep consumers loyal to and engaged with your brand, marketers need to set up those all-important guardrails, and to provide the transparency that fosters trust.\n\nMarketing Technology News: Building Bridges, Not Barriers: Brand Strategies For Social Advocacy\n\nEpisode 205: Driving Sales and Marketing Engagement with Video-Audio Outreach: Featuring Michael Litt, CEO at Vidyard", "source": {"uri": "martechseries.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarTech Series"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Global", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zeta Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Word of mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://martechseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Damian_Rollison_martech-AI-blunders-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Sixty-six percent of respondents to a Deloitte survey believe AI is critical to success.\n\nYet, when it comes to actually creating an AI strategy, things get tricky. According to Deloitte, only 40% of businesses have an AI strategy, and 38% of those believe their use of AI differentiates them from their competitors.\n\nOne reason it's difficult for organizations to conceptualize how AI can drive competitive differentiation is that AI is often presented at two ends of a spectrum. On one side are low-level tools and APIs for developers. These might help execute a plan, but businesses that invest hoping a plan will materialize often end up with a cacophony of misaligned demos.\n\nOn the other side, many existing platforms embed AI into their features. But while your sales or marketing teams might appreciate tools that help compose emails or score leads, built-in features won't address differentiated challenges and opportunities.\n\nA portfolio approach can help address this challenge by combining different types of AI to unify efforts across the organization. Instead of relying exclusively on vendor-specific tools built for the \"median customer,\" AI portfolios allow organizations to combine these tools with bespoke AI solutions tailored to unique needs.\n\nEach type of AI plays a unique role in enhancing business capabilities. Executives looking to unify their efforts across the enterprise must understand how each type addresses specific business needs, integrates with existing systems and contributes to overarching strategic goals.\n\nThese AI features include the writing assistant in your email software and the chatbot in your CMS -- in other words, the AI features your vendor highlights in their sales or marketing emails to get you to buy a new product or upgrade an existing one. These tools help individual teams increase efficiency and achieve functional KPIs.\n\nWhile embedded AI tools are helpful for what they are, they can't and won't engage comprehensively with your data. By definition, they are not built to advance your unique business strategy. These tools reactively boost productivity, meaning they respond to specific inputs or queries but do not proactively address broader business objectives or integrate seamlessly with other systems.\n\nToday, many discussions of enterprise AI lead to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), using AI tools specifically to query internal data sets. Think ChatGPT -- you ask a question, an application applies relevant knowledge and outside context and an LLM formulates a valuable response.\n\nFor businesses, RAG-based agents allow employees to make dynamic queries against data libraries to increase their teams' efficiency. Imagine having a superhuman employee with all the information about your company at their fingertips. By incorporating data from across your company, RAG tools can be much more well-equipped to integrate with your overall business strategy.\n\nOne thing to note, however, is that RAG tools are, by definition, reactive; they must be asked a question to produce answers. Often, knowing when and what to ask is the toughest challenge, especially when it comes to using data beyond your own team.\n\nStreaming AI can help enhance an AI action plan by adding proactivity. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applies dynamic queries to a stable knowledge base, stream-trigger augmented generation (STAG) AI monitors fixed, business-specific queries against dynamic streaming data, including previously dormant unstructured data. Unlike RAG tools, STAG systems automatically and continuously query streaming data such as customer calls, emails and chats on behalf of the user, triggering existing workflows across systems and tools.\n\nIn contrast to embedded AI features, which often access data only within their own vendor ecosystems, streaming AI can utilize data from various sources. This provides a more comprehensive view and enables more effective decision making. Streaming AI can pinpoint and address problems before they escalate, process and contextualize information across teams and help break down organizational silos. For example, it can flag compliance risks in support calls, detect traits for marketing personalization in chat transcripts or trigger upsell workflows from survey feedback.\n\nStreaming AI enables organizations to train AI models and integrate AI components into workflows that reflect their unique business processes. By continuously querying new data against established business objectives, streaming AI ensures consistency across your portfolio of AI applications, including vendor tools and internal RAG systems. This amplifies the impact of individual and functional efforts across the organization, helping ensure a cohesive AI strategy by unifying data and insights across tools.\n\nEnterprises don't organize work in just one way. Getting the job done requires combinations of specialized tools, ad-hoc meetings and proactive workflows. AI is no different. An AI portfolio enables companies to integrate off-the-shelf solutions that leverage existing infrastructure while fostering innovation through new capabilities.\n\nPer McKinsey, up to 70% of the effort involves wrangling and harmonizing data. An AI portfolio can help address this challenge by continuously processing real-time data streams, ensuring AI and digital teams have near real-time access to necessary data to reduce costs, streamline governance and accelerate AI application development.

They are introducing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, collaborative robots and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to enhance the workforce.\n\nManufacturers are increasingly addressing the industry's labour shortage and skills gap by increasing automation. They are introducing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, collaborative robots and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to enhance the workforce.\n\nThis trend has gained momentum in India, too. Notably, Rockwell Automation's latest global survey revealed that 52% of Indian manufacturers have already invested in AI/ML, with 39% of manufacturers planning to invest in it within 12 months. Furthermore, 59% of Indian manufacturers have already invested in generative AI (GAI).\n\nIndustry observers often grapple with a key question: Should AI adoption be led by the leadership team or the operational teams within an organisation? There are no straightforward answers to it.\n\nExperts point out that leaders have a pivotal role in empowering individuals, a responsibility that extends beyond implementing new technology. They emphasise the vital role of leadership in creating a harmonious environment for AI's success and ensuring team members remain in sync. To effectively embrace AI technologies, they also recommend leaders prioritise upskilling and reskilling of their workforce.\n\nDilip Sawhney, managing director, Rockwell Automation India, says leadership is crucial in defining the vision; making strategic decisions; and creating a conducive environment for successful AI adoption and implementation. The leadership's role in adopting AI in manufacturing is to push for change, maintain a balance between people and technology, and overcome barriers for tech adoption.\n\n\"Leaders play a critical role in driving AI adoption. They should focus not only on implementing AI technology but also on considering the impact on the workforce. They must expect and have a plan to overcome obstacles that organisations may face in the next 12 months. These obstacles include assessing business and technology/talent fit, effectively managing people and resources, and attracting and retaining a quality workforce. Addressing these challenges is crucial for successfully adopting AI and driving positive business outcomes,\" says Sawhney.\n\nLeadership sets the vision while teams implement the innovation\n\nBased on the best practices in AI adoption, several teams are typically involved. This involves not only the leadership team but also executives and senior managers. They play a vital role in establishing the vision, strategy and goals for AI implementation, and also the necessary resources, support and guidance to drive the adoption process.\n\nFor example, there is a data science team comprising data scientists, machine learning engineers and AI specialists at any organisation leveraging AI. The team develops and implements AI models, algorithms and solutions. These people work on data collection, preprocessing, model training and evaluation to ensure the successful deployment of AI technologies. Besides, the operations team -- including manufacturing engineers and process experts -- plays a critical role in integrating AI technologies into existing manufacturing processes.\n\nAdditionally, AI adoption often requires collaboration across various departments and functions within an organisation. These cross-functional teams may include representatives from operations, IT, data science, quality assurance, supply chain and other relevant areas. They work together to align AI initiatives with business objectives, share domain knowledge, and ensure the successful implementation and integration of AI technologies.\n\nNeed for a balanced approach\n\nAnother aspect worth considering is the need for a balanced approach between leadership and involved teams in driving AI adoption. The question here is how would this equilibrium be defined.\n\nSankar Chakraborti, Group CEO &MD of Acuit\u00e9, says, \"When an organisation wants to use technology that has disruptive potential, it is very important that leadership and the operational team work hand in hand. While AI throws up tremendous opportunities, it also will bring risks. Cost savings, operational efficiency, mitigation of people risk and finding new and better solutions will drive breakthroughs in AI. But faster obsolescence of technologies, job losses, and risks to IT security will necessitate regulatory oversight. In this scenario, strategic leadership should be provided by CXOs in carefully evaluating the risks and benefits.\"\n\nGiven the realities on the ground for firms utilising AI, Sawhney from Rockwell India asserts that teams play a vital role in the adoption of AI. Their primary function is to collaborate and work collectively with teams to ensure that AI solutions align with business needs, are technically feasible and deliver the desired outcomes. These teams play a crucial role in data preparation, model development, system integration, monitoring, and continuous improvement of AI systems in manufacturing.\n\nSriram Kanuri, CEO & Founder of Arteria, says, \"Seniors should drive AI adoption, setting the vision and strategic priorities for the organisation. However, teams on the ground must be deeply involved in the implementation, more so in the case of AI. It will allay any fears around job losses. By fostering a collaborative environment where leadership provides direction and teams bring their practical insights, organisations can harness the full potential of AI.\"\n\nThis dual approach ensures that AI initiatives are both visionary and grounded in operational reality, leading to meaningful transformation and sustained competitive advantage.\n\nExperts state that the combination of visionary thinking and practical application in AI initiatives leads to increased productivity. Such a collaborative model leverages the strengths of both leadership and teams, driving successful AI integration across the organisation and reinforcing the positive outcomes of collaboration.\n\nGopichand Katragadda, President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), is of the view that leadership vision is critical in setting the strategic objectives for AI adoption and establishing robust GAI policies to safeguard the company and its customers. He suggests leaders establish a clear vision and framework to ensure that AI initiatives are in line with the organisation's goals. This top-down approach, he says, is essential for creating a cohesive strategy that addresses both opportunities and potential risks associated with AI.\n\n\"Yet, the tactical implementation and innovative ideas for AI applications should primarily emerge from the operational teams and individual contributors. These teams, with their intimate familiarity with the specific needs and challenges of their domains, can identify practical applications for AI that leadership might overlook.

More than half said they did not know enough about it (53%), 20% said they had never needed to use it, 14% did not know what the technology did, and 11% were apprehensive about AI.\n\nConcerns about AI adoption in South Africa are largely based on the country's high unemployment rate and fears that AI would hurt, not help, efforts to reduce joblessness.\n\n\"There is a resistance to change and huge insecurity around jobs being lost due to the efficiencies machine learning and AI bring to the market,\" says Muhammad Ali, managing director of South African ISO specialist World Wide Industrial & Systems Engineers (WWISE).\n\nWhile these concerns do have merit, Ali suggests these technologies should not be viewed as job replacements but as job enhancers. If mundane and repetitive tasks can be performed by AI and machine learning, employees will be freed up from endless data capturing to focus more on strategy and analysis.\n\nIn this way, not only are costs saved and human resources allocated to parts of the business where their skills could be put to better use, but a machine's ability to collect quality and accurate data can lead to better and more informed decision-making.\n\nThe advent of AI and machine learning in operations essentially compels employees to upskill themselves, which brings obvious advantages to companies. More effective workers make for better businesses which in turn leads to higher profit margins.\n\n\"At WWISE, we search through 3,000 websites in 10 minutes with an AI tool every day, simply by using keywords. Previously, a human resource could only do 20 websites a day. The AI and ML tools assist in managing repetitive tasks more efficiently and allow human resources to focus on more challenging tasks that empower them and enrich their ability to learn and grow,\" Ali says.\n\nIt is interesting to note what South Africans who have embraced ChatGPT are using it for. According to the In On Africa report, 53% of respondents employ the chatbot to improve their writing, 43% to enhance research and analysis, 42% to create content and 40% to resolve general problems.\n\nSixty-four percent agree that it has increased speed, efficiency and productivity at work.\n\nGiven that many South African companies deal a lot with counterparts in other parts of the world - most of which have integrated these technologies into their operations - AI and automation adoption must align with international standards and best practices.\n\nSubscribing to standards set out by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is crucial in this regard, Ali says, particularly since cybercrime is extremely prevalent in most parts of the world.\n\n\"The ISO/IEC 42001:2023 - Information Technology - Artificial Intelligence Management System is the international standard of choice for organisations looking to develop AI and machine learning use and management.\n\n\"This safeguards organisations by ensuring they are not compromised from a security perspective and addresses the unique challenges AI poses, including ethical considerations, transparency and continuous learning.\"\n\nAli says it is now a case of when, not if, businesses introduce these technologies into operations. Just as AI is now part of the search function on Meta products, so it will be with other business products, as has already been seen with Microsoft Copilot.\n\n\"The sooner we accept this, the better, and it is up to organisations to educate staff on effective implementation.\"", "source": {"uri": "iafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiokinetic_Wwise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audiokinetic Wwise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Electrotechnical Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://iafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mahdis-mousavi-hJ5uMIRNg5k-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, executives are split on the return on investment (ROI) of AI.\n\nNearly every UK tech executive (94%) says their organisation uses AI in some form, while a few (6%) are still exploring or researching options. Not a single respondent said they're not using AI at all.\n\nThe motivations behind adoption are not entirely universal, with 40% of executives feeling pressured to prioritise adoption and investment in AI following industry-wide momentum around the technology.\n\nHowever, barriers prevent some businesses from adopting AI as much as they would like, including budget restrictions (41%), a shortage of AI talent within the business (38%), and technical complexity (35%).\n\nMeanwhile, the primary concerns businesses have related to AI adoption, according to the executives, include integration challenges (44%), cost and ROI uncertainty (42%), and data privacy and IP security (38%). Interestingly, only 28% of respondents said there is cultural resistance to AI adoption from within their organisation.\n\n\"AI adoption isn't some 'on or off' switch,\" says Michal Szymczak, head of AI atrategy at Zartis. \"To a lot of businesses, it involves a significant financial investment, and there are complex questions to grapple with surrounding data privacy, or integration with existing technology stacks.\n\n\"That makes executives' confidence in their company's AI skill set rather ironic. They puff their chests out, while simultaneously pointing to all the obstacles that could stop them in their tracks. That feels like a severe underestimation of how much work needs to happen to make AI capabilities work with software development and DevOps practices.\"\n\nExecutives are split on the cost element of AI, though. While 42% raised ROI uncertainty as a primary business concern, 53% of executives see cost savings through improved efficiency as one of the most significant long-term business benefits of adopting AI.\n\nIn fact, 'cost savings' was the respondents' most popular answer when asked about the most significant benefits of adopting AI in their business.\n\nNearly everyone (93%) is spending at least \u00a3100,000 on AI capabilities in 2024, while nearly half (44%) are spending at least \u00a3500,000. Another 25% are spending at least \u00a31,000,000. Only 1% plan to spend above \u00a32,000,000.\n\nSoftware development is the most popular area (59%) where executives say they plan to make AI investments with this money in 2024. The next most popular areas include quality assurance (44%) and DevOps and automation (44%).\n\nThis lines up with the data showing that skills shortage and talent acquisition (46%), quality assurance and testing (40%), and continuous integration and deployment (40%) are the top three cited challenges organisations face within their software development teams today.\n\nHow much money will be saved in the long term remains debatable: about 56% of executives believe AI will reduce software development costs by at least 20%, while 36% expect less.\n\n\"I think what will become clear over time is who's investing into AI for the sake of it, and who's doing it for the genuine betterment of their business,\" says Angel Benito, CTO at Zartis. \"There's clearly a lot of pressure on organisations to keep up with AI development or get left behind, which would explain why so many are making the investment despite the uncertainty about the ROI.\n\n\"They see the potential for long-term cost savings, regardless of whether that view is backed up by hard-boiled evidence or fairy dust. They must understand that it's not about the tools at the end of the day. It's about doing that deep-dive due diligence work into identifying and understanding where and how the tools will make employees at their organisations more productive.\"\n\n\"There is significant pressure on organisations to keep up with AI development or risk being left behind. This explains why many are investing despite the uncertainty about ROI. They see the potential for long-term cost savings but need a well-curated plan to implement the changes.\n\n\"It's crucial to understand that it's not just about the tools; it's about the people. The key step is identifying and understanding how and where these tools will enhance employee productivity or make products more competitive.\"\n\nWhen asked how executives plan to use AI to solve or alleviate the most significant challenges within their software development teams, the responses are decidedly mixed, with no clear winner.\n\nThe top three cited utilities of AI for software development are AI-powered copilot tools for coding (53%), improved continuous integration and deployment (52%), and improved team communication and collaboration (46%).\n\nThe study follows recent research from Zartis showing that over three-quarters of UK tech executives favour more government AI oversight.\n\nA majority of them even express being broadly satisfied with current global government coordination of AI regulation - with many anticipating a myriad of benefits from the EU AI Act in particular.", "source": {"uri": "digit.fyi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digit"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DevOps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_consulting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology consulting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continuous integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "http://www.digit.fyi/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-10T125006.227.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

This study explores the adoption and use of artificial intelligence (AI) by asset management firms. In a volatile market environment with increasing regulatory demands, AI is emerging as a key tool for addressing asset management challenges, particularly in enhancing agility and operational efficiency. However, implementing these AI solutions will require time to establish a solid foundation, especially in overcoming challenges related to acquiring quality data and ensuring expected outcomes.\n\nAI Gains Ground Driven by the Quest for Productivity\n\nCurrently, 32% of asset management firms have not yet started their AI journey, while 33% are in the experimentation phase, and 36% are actively using AI. Among the latter, 14% have multiple use cases in production and plan further implementations. Over the next year, 37% of companies will focus on expanding AI use, 22% will increase experimentation, and 28% will monitor progress. The most popular applications of Generative AI (GenAI) include document synthesis (28%), data extraction (28%), and knowledge bases/Q&A (17%). Additionally, Generative AI is finding crucial commercial applications, particularly in enhancing front office productivity. Optimizing the efficiency of the transaction team (23%) and directly generating transaction research or yields (18%) are among the most common use cases. AI also plays a vital role in boosting the productivity of middle and back-office operations (19%).\n\n\"In a market under multiple pressures, AI adoption in asset management is accelerating. More companies are investing in this technology to stay competitive and develop new use cases. However, implementing AI solutions and realizing their value is a technological endeavor that requires time to establish the right foundations, secure buy-in, drive cultural change, and mitigate risks,\" explains Jamil Jiva, Global Head of Asset Management at Linedata.\n\nExpertise and Data Management Challenges\n\nFor 46% of respondents, AI expertise comes entirely from within the company, while only 14% rely solely on external partners. The remaining 40% use a hybrid approach. AI solutions are primarily accessed by purchasing off-the-shelf products (25%), though a notable 18% develop them entirely in-house. Conversely, 32% access AI solutions indirectly through brokers, fund administrators, or outsourcing service providers. Besides AI adoption overall enthusiasm, challenges are numerous: data quality and update (19%), costs understanding and business cases development (15%) along with AI expertise availability (13%).

The rules required chatbots to adhere to \"core socialist values\" and protect national security. Yet penalties were not as strict as observers feared, which analysts read as Beijing signaling support for the fledgling industry.\n\nIn October, the Biden administration passed an executive order that, among other measures, called upon AI developers to share safety test data with the U.S. government. Then, earlier this year, the European Union passed its own comprehensive set of AI regulations, dubbed the AI Act.\n\nStill, AI companies may find it difficult to navigate a patchwork of different AI rules. \"It's good to have regulations. It's just not good to have three different ones,\" Brian says. \"It's inefficient.\"\n\nChina's AI investment\n\nSince the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, Chinese tech firms large and small are rushing to create their own large language models and generative AI programs.\n\nBig tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba, and JD.com are investing in their own large language models; Baidu claims its ERNIE LLM outperforms the latest version of GPT-4 in some Chinese-language tasks. Several Chinese startups -- like 01.AI, founded by former Google China president Kai-Fu Lee -- are also racing to release chatbots and other generative AI products.\n\nYet China's AI companies are also struggling with a shortage of AI chips, made worse by U.S. controls barring the export of advanced processors (like those made from Nvidia) to China. Startups are reportedly rationing the use of their products due to a lack of computing power.\n\nOn Monday, iFlyTek-one of China's leading AI developers-said it was likely to post a net loss of up to $64.53 million for the first half of the year, which it partly blamed on the \"ultimate exertion of pressures from the U.S.\" in a Shenzhen stock filing. Shares are down 5.4% since Friday's close.\n\n\"All countries are looking for information advantage as a result of AI,\" Harris says, from the level of national security all the way down to commercial applications. \"Generative AI becomes the new nuclear arms race in that regard,\" he says.\n\nYet Chinese companies have some advantages, such as being \"more aggressive\" than their U.S. peers when it comes to combining datasets and applying them to AI models, Harris says.\n\nHe's optimistic that Chinese companies like Alibaba can still catch up to their U.S. peers like OpenAI, even with a shortage of cutting-edge GPUs. \"What's cool about this whole movement is that there's innovation happening almost simultaneously around the world. That's a good thing, right?\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The Insights 2024: Attitudes toward AI report, based on a survey of 3,000 researchers and clinicians across 123 countries, reveals that both groups see AI having the greatest potential in accelerating knowledge discovery, increasing work quality and saving costs.\n\nHowever, to maximize the use of AI, both groups are clear about the specific concerns that need to be addressed: they want assurances of quality content, trust and transparency before integrating AI tools into their daily work.\n\nMost notably, the majority of clinicians and researchers familiar with AI, said they believe in AI's potential to help them and their organizations in their work:\n\nHowever, both respondent groups fear further rise in misinformation could impact critical decisions:\n\n\u00b7 95% of researchers along with 93% of clinicians believe AI will be used for misinformation\n\n\u00b7 86% of researchers and 85% of clinicians believe AI could cause critical errors, while a similar ratio expressed concern about AI leading to weakened critical thinking\n\n\u00b7 81% of researchers worry AI will erode critical thinking with 82% of doctors expressing concern that physicians will become over reliant on AI to make clinical decisions\n\nResearchers and clinicians expect tools to be based on high quality, trusted content and want transparency about the use of generative AI:\n\n\u00b7 71% expect generative AI dependent tools' results to be based on high quality trusted sources only.\n\nThe findings also reveal different attitudes amongst researchers and clinicians in the world's top three research-generating nations, the US, China and India:\n\nResearchers and clinicians in China, India and the US who believe AI would help them in their work are more closely aligned, albeit still with some difference in how likely they are to use a trusted AI assistant to review prior studies, identify gaps in knowledge and generate a new research hypothesis for testing. Respondents in India stood at 100% likelihood, China at 96%, and the US at 84%.\n\nKieran West, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Elsevier, said: \"AI has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, including research, innovation and healthcare, all vital drivers of societal progress. As it becomes more integrated into our everyday lives and continues to advance at a rapid pace, its adoption is expected to rise. Researchers and clinicians worldwide are telling us they have an appetite for adoption to aid their profession and work, but not at the cost of ethics, transparency and accuracy. They have indicated that high quality, verified information, responsible development and transparency are paramount to building trust in AI tools, and alleviating concerns over misinformation and inaccuracy. This report suggests some steps that need to be taken to build confidence and usage in the AI tools of today and tomorrow.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, Elsevier has been using AI and machine learning technologies in combination with our world-class peer-reviewed content, extensive data sets and expert human oversight to create products that help the research, life sciences and healthcare communities be more effective every day.

Anthropic's generative AI model Claude has now released a feature that can automate prompt engineering, Tech Crunch reports.\n\nDevelopers can now make use this function using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, allowing them to generate, test and evaluate prompts with prompt engineering techniques that can create better instructions for improved outputs.\n\nAI has become an incredibly useful tool for software developers. Lets explore how AI can help developers create digital assets, particularly apps.\n\nAI development has taken off. Geniusee notes that 92% of companies already make use of AI based personalisation to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nArtificial intelligence ultimately mimics human intelligence to solve complex problems. Machine learning, a subdivision of AI, uses large amounts of data, statistics, and algorithms to provide insights so that we can make better decisions.\n\nAI can thus be used to perform any repetitive tasks in the development process, allowing developers to make entire apps in much less time.\n\nAI can help developers make apps from the very beginning, such as suggesting app ideas. AI can also use machine learning to predict user behaviour and suggest features that would suit their needs.\n\nAI can also be used to solve problems and provide solutions in the instance of bugs, as it is capable of writing and testing code.\n\nHere are a few key ways AI can benefit software developers:\n\nInstead of doing extensive market research, which can be a time consuming process, AI can analyse any applicable trends and how the app market is performing in various industries. This can save developers time and effort researching the market as AI can give developers a better idea of what problems their target audience needs solutions to.\n\nAI can also do predictive analysis, and suggest features that could be valuable to users. Since AI can write code, it can also write the lines of code necessary for these features to work.\n\nOnce the code is written, developers can check, adjust, and customise it using AI before testing. Then, AI can help with testing, such as testing the functionality of the features and the performance of the app.\n\nCreating mobile apps requires time and resources, and creating great apps comes at a price. Including AI in the development process can reduce labour costs, developers will be able to spend less time on repetitive, routine tasks and more time on aspects such as features.\n\nAI can also track user behaviour patterns and identify any areas that may need work, or bugs that need to be fixed, increasing customer satisfaction. This helps ensure any adjustments to the app can be made in a timely manner, retaining users.\n\nAI chatbots can also instantly assist individuals with any problems they may face, reducing the need to hire customer service representatives.\n\nTo conclude, AI can be a valuable tool to help developers make apps.

(Image courtesy of Fast Forward.)\n\nAt a time of unprecedented technological progress, the potential to harness tech for the benefit of humanity has never been greater. At the forefront of this pursuit is Fast Forward, an organization focused on scaling startups that combine technology with sustainable nonprofit business models.\n\nUnder its AI for Humanity initiative, Fast Forward is focusing on using artificial intelligence (AI) to build solutions for global issues. \"Apart from early tech nonprofits like Wikipedia, Khan Academy or Mozilla, it didn't feel like there were enough examples of people who were using tech to make the world better,\" said Kevin Barenblat, co-founder of Fast Forward. \"So our vision for the AI for Humanity initiative is to support entrepreneurs who are building and using AI to make the world better.\"\n\nThis vision aligns with the growing global dialogue around AI, including its role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and as key component of the 2024 Force for Good technology report.\n\nFounded over a decade ago, Fast Forward supported over 100 tech startups and is a prominent player in the \"tech-for-good\" landscape via its startup accelerator program, which just completed its 11th cohort. This round comprised of 12 startups, two-thirds of which are harnessing the power of AI to tackle issues like poverty, healthcare inequity, education disparities, environmental injustice and more.\n\nAI startups in the cohort are empowering scientists in low-income countries to cure neglected diseases, reducing backlogs in Indian courts to ensure fair and speedy trials, bridging the global digital divide by bringing online learning offline, addressing early childhood education disparities in India, and providing free, virtual mental health interventions to people who need them.\n\nWhat's more, Barenblat estimates about a quarter of the 100 startups Fast Forward worked with are now aggressively moving into AI. \"The newer organizations are more likely to have AI at the center of what they do,\" he said. \"Some have more traditional technology models and are now adopting them for AI. Or some have used older forms of AI, like machine learning, and are now building on more modern generative AI tools.\"\n\nOne of the most obvious and powerful uses for AI is managing incredible volumes of data, Barenblat said. One example is RebootRX, a startup working to fast-track affordable cancer treatments using repurposed generic drugs, AI technology and innovative funding models.\n\n\"Mounds and mounds of research exists, but no human can read it all,\" Barenblat said. \"So RebootRX uses AI to read through the articles, papers, and research studies to identify the most promising drug candidates, and then tries to find funders who want to pay for the additional research and clinical trials for those drugs.\"\n\nRebootRX raised at least $1 million so far and was part of Fast Forward's 2020 accelerator cohort.\n\nYet as AI evolves, so do the ethical considerations associated with its deployment. Barenblat acknowledged that AI is just like any tool and can be used in many ways. \"AI, to me, is like the world's invented a new kind of wrench,\" he said. \"It's not just about the tool, but about the impact it can have.\"\n\nBut nonprofit entrepreneurs are typically focused on solving social problems, leading them to use AI ethically and responsibly, Barenblat said. \"We often see in the for-profit world that people build these cool tools and then they try to figure out what problem they solve,\" he said. \"But in the nonprofit space, the entrepreneurs are typically fixated on the problem -- be it education, health inequity, or the climate problem -- and they're slotting in AI to make their solution better. Because they're using AI for a specific use case, they can set guardrails that are appropriate for the way that they're using the AI.\"\n\nDespite being a revolutionary technology, AI nonprofits face all the challenges of any tech startup and nonprofit. \"Tech startup challenges include things like getting product-market fit right, competing for resources and funding, and usually they focus on marginalized customers who are not easy to reach,\" he said. \"So I think AI helps, but at the end of the day, they're still trying to help humans.\"\n\nOver the years, Fast Forward garnered support from major tech giants like OpenAI, Google and Salesforce, all of which provide funding and technical expertise. \"It's usually the investors and philanthropists who are impact first [that support the organization],\" Barenblat said. \"Also, there are some that are very AI-driven, but most of them are very thesis-driven. They're very much interested in, let's say, climate change or education or health, and it just so happens that now there are tools that can enable that kind of impact for much less cost.\"\n\nThat philanthropic drive aligns with Fast Forward's commitment to shaping a future where AI amplifies human capability, rather than replaces it, Barenblat said.\n\n\"The story of AI is not yet written, and it's being written by us,\" he said. \"AI presents us with this unique opportunity to write the future. I don't think AI is actually going to solve any of these problems like health, education, climate or inequities, but it gives humans the opportunity to do so. I do this work because I feel like we have a choice to make and it's really up to us to decide that we want to use AI in this way.\"", "source": {"uri": "triplepundit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "triplepundit.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Forward_(Australian_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fast Forward (Australian TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technological change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital divide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Early childhood education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/Fast%20Forward%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Startups.jpg?h=f4bc3890", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The Insights 2024: Attitudes toward AI report, based on a survey of 3,000 researchers and clinicians across 123 countries, reveals that both groups see AI having the greatest potential in accelerating knowledge discovery, increasing work quality and saving costs.\n\nHowever, to maximize the use of AI, both groups are clear about the specific concerns that need to be addressed: they want assurances of quality content, trust and transparency before integrating AI tools into their daily work.\n\nMost notably, the majority of clinicians and researchers familiar with AI, said they believe in AI's potential to help them and their organizations in their work:\n\n94% of researchers and 96% of clinicians think AI will help accelerate knowledge discovery92% of researchers and 96% of clinicians think it will help rapidly increase the volume of scholarly and medical research92% of researchers and clinicians foresee cost savings for institutions and businesses87% think it will help increase work quality overall85% of both groups believe AI will free up time to focus on higher value projects.\n\nHowever, both respondent groups fear further rise in misinformation could impact critical decisions:\n\n95% of researchers along with 93% of clinicians believe AI will be used for misinformation86% of researchers and 85% of clinicians believe AI could cause critical errors, while a similar ratio expressed concern about AI leading to weakened critical thinking81% of researchers worry AI will erode critical thinking with 82% of doctors expressing concern that physicians will become over reliant on AI to make clinical decisions79% of clinicians and 80% of researchers believe AI will cause disruption to society.\n\nResearchers and clinicians expect tools to be based on high quality, trusted content and want transparency about the use of generative AI:\n\nIf AI tools are backed by trusted content, quality controls and responsible AI principles, 89% of researchers who expressed belief AI can benefit their work would use it to generate a synthesis of articles, while 94% of clinicians who believe AI can benefit their work said they would employ AI to assess symptoms and identify conditions or diseases.Transparency is key. 81% of researchers and clinicians expect to be told whether the tools they are using depend on generative AI.71% expect generative AI dependent tools' results to be based on high quality trusted sources only.78% of researchers and 80% of clinicians expect to be informed if the peer-review recommendations they receive about manuscripts utilize generative AI.\n\nThe findings also reveal different attitudes amongst researchers and clinicians in the world's top three research-generating nations, the US, China and India:\n\nOf those familiar with AI over half (54%) have actively used AI with just under a third (31%) for a specific work-related purpose. This is higher in China (39%) and lower in India (22%)Only 11% of respondents consider themselves very familiar with AI or use it often. 67% of those who have not used AI expect to in two to five years with China (83%) and India (79%) outpacing the US (53%) significantlyUS respondents are less likely to feel positive about the future impact of AI on their area of work - 28% in the US vs. 46% in China, 41% in India.\n\nResearchers and clinicians in China, India and the US who believe AI would help them in their work are more closely aligned, albeit still with some difference in how likely they are to use a trusted AI assistant to review prior studies, identify gaps in knowledge and generate a new research hypothesis for testing.

Where digital footprints are ubiquitous and data has become a valuable commodity, AI has emerged as a focal point of innovation and concern. With AI now being integrated into operating systems (OS) promising enhanced efficiency, it is crucial to recognize that along with these advancements come new risks.\n\nBasics of an AI Model\n\nAI models, which come in various forms, are essentially predictive programs trained to recognize patterns and generate responses. Engineers use vast datasets, ranging from private purchases to publicly available and web-scraped data, to train these models. Much like human learning, AI models retain patterns from their training to respond to queries without revisiting the original source material.\n\nAI on an Operating System\n\nThe newest flavor of AI coming to fashion is the integration of an AI model into the OS of devices like phones or computers. Operating as an extension of the OS itself, these AI models primarily access local device data. They are \"trained\" before installation and continue learning from user interactions to tailor responses. This model is touted to be helpful with scheduling, drafting, searches, and other simple queries. When tasked with a query that is beyond its capacity, the embedded AI model will forward the request to the larger AI model in the cloud for a larger model to handle. Presumably, the larger model will process, return a response, and delete information about that request.\n\nRisks and Exposure\n\nDespite their differences, both integrated and cloud-based AI models pose similar risks to users:\n\nPreemptive Measures\n\nAs companies increasingly integrate AI into their OS, it is essential for employers to proactively address these risks. Employers can preemptively prepare for this inevitable change by:\n\nAt Jackson Lewis, our Technology Group remains at the forefront of AI innovation in this rapidly evolving industry.

But there's another consideration: how to equip students and current workers with the AI skills they'll need to succeed in the workforce.\n\nBuilding the AI know-how to compete isn't something only new graduates will need-it's just as critical to upskill current workers with AI knowledge and experience to enable their professional growth.\n\nMarc Booker, Ph.D., Vice Provost of Strategy at the University of Phoenix, shares key strategies that address AI upskilling to keep employees in the know when it comes to AI skill development.\n\nHere's what Booker suggests:\n\nTip 1: Believe that your existing employees can lean into AI and have the skills and abilities to be upskilled instead of going outside of the organization. This is somewhat obvious but often overlooked. Based on a recent study, more than half of workers say knowing how to leverage AI would give them an advantage in their career, and several roles tied to AI (like prompt engineering) do not need long-form credentials like a data-science or programming degree. Taking existing personnel and unlocking their potential through training may be a cleaner and more efficient path that also drives better employee engagement than hiring externally.\n\nTip 2: Create an environment that encourages exploration of AI solutions in the workplace. There is no better teacher than hands-on practice, and hands-on practice that leads to improvement is a powerful agent for change. To upskill workers with AI, create organizationally-approved initiatives where employees are able to use different AI tools as an opportunity to potentially solve organizational problems. This approach has myriad benefits from learning more about AI models, improving the skills of users, limiting risk from employees using unsupported tools, and improving organizational processes with outcomes of the AI experimentation.\n\nTip 3: Come up with an organizational philosophy on AI. Upskilling employees requires a clear path and direction on what is necessary to learn and apply for the improvement of an organization. AI and its uses, models, applications, and designs are vast and varied. An organization that has not taken the time to create a philosophy, determine ethical use, and identify goals will have a hard time directing employees to the right trainings or programs in which to get involved to properly upskill, so focusing on this will create clear pathways of development that benefit both the employee and the organization.\n\nTip 4: Implement mentorship and community of practice opportunities. Formal training programs are an excellent starting point for those getting into the field of AI, but internal programs or communities can unlock further potential in upskilling staff members and improving their ability to interact and engage with different models or tools. Whether it is more personal, like 1:1 mentoring or larger community of practice groups, providing formal programs for your organization to engage in and discover how to better leverage and apply AI can act as a fertile ground to support employee upskilling on a practical level.", "source": {"uri": "ecampusnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eCampus News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_ascione@ecampusnews.com", "name": "Laura Ascione", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Phoenix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provost (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community of practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mentorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.ecampusnews.com/files/2024/07/AI-upskilling.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Educators Are To Blame", "body": "Fascinating research via Hopelab and the Center for Digital Thriving at Harvard Graduate School of Education examining how young people perceive and interact with generative AI technologies show very slow adoption of this transformational technology. I think our educational system is to blame for not bringing AI into the classroom.\n\nThe report Teen and Young Adult Perspectives on Generative AI: Patterns of Use, Excitements, and Concerns finds that nearly half (49%) of young people ages 14-22 have either never used generative AI or do not know what the tools are. Only 11% use AI once or twice a week and 4% report being daily users.\n\nWe've been here before.\n\nWhen I was a kid, electronic calculators were introduced. Throughout my school years, calculators were banned in classrooms, we could only solve math problems with a pencil and paper.\n\nThen in the 1990s and 2000s, the Web made information widely available to anybody with access to an internet connection. Rather than teach students how to be smart information consumers, most educational systems simply banned all use of Web content for schoolwork.\n\nGasp! Anybody could update Wikipedia or start a blog! So much unverified information! It was deemed better to go to the school library to find a few often-dated books on a topic than tap the vast resources of all the world's knowledge.\n\nSure, there is false and misleading information on the web.\n\nRather than hiding, we should have been teaching students how to understand and use electronic information. How much better off would society be had we taught people about different media sources, how to think critically about them, and how to make up their own minds.\n\nAnd now we have AI, perhaps the most transformational technology ever invented.\n\nAccording to the study, of the young people who have never used generative AI, one-third (34%) think it would not be helpful. Clearly, this is a failure of understanding as AI can be helpful to anyone.\n\nThe sad truth is many educators still believe that all AI use is just plagiarism. Few understand that generative AI apps like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini are much more than just a place to create an entire essay, which is how most of them first encountered the tools.\n\nYes, we don't just want young people to ask ChatGPT to do write their homework assignment. However, there are so many valuable ways that students can use the technology.\n\nWe should be teaching young people how generative AI can help them!\n\nI was about to think up a bunch of ways students can make use of AI. That would have taken 10 or 15 minutes, and the list would have been incomplete. Instead, I just asked Perplexity how generative AI can help students and, in a few seconds, I got a way better answer than if I had tried to think of the ways myself.\n\n\"Intro to AI should be a required course for every first-year college student. How can AI be a part of every assignment? ...Teach people how to use AI, but make sure students are thinking critically about the outputs they're getting. This is what's going to be asked of them in the real world. The sooner we teach them how to work with the tools, the more capable they will be when they get into the professional world.\"\n\nPaul's right. And as he also said, we should be teaching AI to younger kids too, in high school, middle school, and even elementary school.\n\nAt the recent US Presidential debate, I was waiting for a question on generative AI, a transformational technology affecting all aspects of society. Yet no question was asked of the candidates.\n\nIf government, the media, and educators are slow to respond, it's up to all of us: Parents, relatives, and concerned citizens to ensure that AI is taught in schools. Ask about AI when you meet with your kids' teachers. If they don't have a good response, go to the principal or school board.

While exactly how this will happen is still an open book, it is likely not only to change customer expectations of the digital and brand experiences they want to receive but also to change how we craft and create those experiences.\n\nTo date on CMSWire, we've mainly focused on what the impact of generative AI will be on the digital marketing teams and related creatives who design sites and create the relevant content. But generative AI will also impact IT professionals and development teams -- both front end and back end -- involved in the world of digital customer experience.\n\nIn this post, I'm going to explore seven ways in which generative AI is impacting the way development teams work with digital customer experience, and the areas that IT professionals need to consider regarding their ways of working.\n\nOf course, generative AI will boost developer productivity, and this is already happening. Even back in 2023, 92% of US-based developers were using AI to support their coding, with 70% reporting benefits.\n\nAI generates code, checks for errors and best practices, and can also take less-experienced developers through the steps involved. At Cylogy, the software development company I co-founded, we've found it's particularly good for documenting the code that has been deployed, a valuable but time-consuming activity that is not always carried out as thoroughly as it should be.\n\nAll this is good news for the world of digital customer experience with developers simply able to get more done quickly and also to follow through with good practices such as documenting their work.\n\nRelated Article: Can Traditional Web Development Survive AI?\n\nBut as with marketing copy, AI-generated code also comes with some risks. Although some of these are being ironed out as solutions develop and we all become climatized to better usage, risks still need to be considered. These include:\n\nTo reduce risks, it's worth considering:\n\nThese risks are becoming easier to manage. And, with the right approaches in place, they should not prevent developers benefitting from the productivity gains generative AI delivers.\n\nRelated Article: Will AI Chatbots Make Coders Obsolete?\n\nThere are also wider concerns around the use of generative AI for unethical purposes that may compromise data privacy, security and regulations, or produce output that is inappropriate or illegal. There are also debates about ensuring there are safeguards in place so AI doesn't evolve unintentionally in ways that are unethical.\n\nThe use of generative AI to create a little bit of code for your website might feel a little removed from the bigger ethical picture, but any use of AI doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's surprisingly easy to stray over into gray areas. Have an ethical framework and commitment that frames the use of generative AI.\n\nRelated Article: Generative AI Technologies: Now and in the Future\n\nOne positive impact of generative AI is that it potentially opens up the market for developers who can use generative AI to bridge initial gaps in experience they might previously have needed to work with a particular CMS or DXP. For example, experienced Sitecore developers are not always easy to find and can be expensive.\n\nThe ability to code more easily potentially lowers the barriers for entry for less experienced developers to gain the foothold they need. Experience can still be important, and we see generative AI not necessarily supplanting the value of that experience; it just helps more developers gain it. Over time, however, the experience acquired on a particular CMS may become less important as generative AI does more and more of the heavy lifting around frontend and backend development.\n\n\"Garbage in, garbage out\" is a well-worn saying that is applied to many systems that don't deliver the right results perhaps because users aren't entering the right text or prompts to get the best out of a tool. This absolutely holds true for generative AI solutions like ChatGPT where having the right prompts will determine the success of the output.\n\nDevelopers need to become climatized to using generative AI to get the best out of a tool to support their coding efforts. Many have found that the learning curve is actually pretty modest, but there are always tips and tricks to get the very best value out of a particular AI product.\n\nThe creation of low code-no code solutions, which provide configuration options for non-IT professionals, has been a software development trend for a while. The emergence of generative AI has the potential for the rapid evolution of more no code-low code interfaces that mean digital marketers and business users can achieve more without the help of their IT colleagues. For example, intelligent styling options may require less and less involvement from a frontend developer.\n\nThis could change developers' roles in digital customer experience to focus more on oversight and advising on what can be achieved through configuration versus coding. Of course, it also means IT professionals can also use no code-low code options themselves to carry out their work in the most efficient way possible.\n\nGitHub Copilot already feels like a relatively mature solution, but generative AI continues to evolve at breakneck speed with new and improved large language models (LLMs), emerging products and the introduction of generative AI features into existing solutions. The net impact? A continuation of a rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace involving AI solutions that can generate code and assist IT development.\n\nAt Cylogy, we've kept an open mind on the best solutions to use and allow our individual developers to use their preferred solution, particularly in these early days. However, we'll be coming together soon to review where we are and create some solid guidelines around product use, while also continuing to keep an eye on what's happening in the product space. Any guidelines will likely evolve further.\n\nJust like every other area of work, generative AI is changing how developers work in the digital customer experience space. The details around this are likely to change -- and potentially rapidly -- in the coming months and years. It's vital to keep an eye on the space, take appropriate actions to safeguard against risks but also seize the opportunities that exist.", "source": {"uri": "cmswire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CMS Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compiler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content management system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GitHub Copilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.cmswire.com/-/media/c97091d858374a7f93b2a71431171d98.ashx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Do you like this post? Did you know that I also do a podcast called Better Offline? If not, please immediately download it on your podcast app. Follow the show. Download every episode. Share with your friends, and demand they do the same.\n\nA week and a half ago, Goldman Sachs put out a 31-page-report (titled \"Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\") that includes some of the most damning literature on generative AI I've ever seen. And yes, that sound you hear is the slow deflation of the bubble I've been warning you about since March.\n\nThe report covers AI's productivity benefits (which Goldman remarks are likely limited), AI's returns (which are likely to be significantly more limited than anticipated), and AI's power demands (which are likely so significant that utility companies will have to spend nearly 40% more in the next three years to keep up with the demand from hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft).\n\nThis report is so significant because Goldman Sachs, like any investment bank, does not care about anyone's feelings unless doing so is profitable. It will gladly hype anything if it thinks it'll make a buck. Back in May, it was claimed that AI (not just generative AI) was \"showing very positive signs of eventually boosting GDP and productivity,\" even though said report buried within it constant reminders that AI had yet to impact productivity growth, and states that only about 5% of companies report using generative AI in regular production.\n\nFor Goldman to suddenly turn on the AI movement suggests that it's extremely anxious about the future of generative AI, with almost everybody agreeing on one core point: that the longer this tech takes to make people money, the more money it's going to need to make.\n\nThe report includes an interview with economist Daron Acemoglu of MIT (page 4), an Institute Professor who published a paper back in May called \"The Simple Macroeconomics of AI\" that argued that \"the upside to US productivity and, consequently, GDP growth from generative AI will likely prove much more limited than many forecasters expect.\" A month has only made Acemoglu more pessimistic, declaring that \"truly transformative changes won't happen quickly and few - if any - will likely occur within the next 10 years,\" and that generative AI's ability to affect global productivity is low because \"many of the tasks that humans currently perform...are multi-faceted and require real-world interaction, which AI won't be able to materially improve anytime soon.\"\n\nWhat makes this interview - and really, this paper -- so remarkable is how thoroughly and aggressively it attacks every bit of marketing collateral the AI movement has. Acemoglu specifically questions the belief that AI models will simply get more powerful as we throw more data and GPU capacity at them, and specifically ask a question: what does it mean to \"double AI's capabilities\"? How does that actually make something like, say, a customer service rep better?\n\nAnd this is a specific problem with the AI fantasists' spiel. They heavily rely on the idea that not only will these large language models (LLMs) get more powerful, but that getting more powerful will somehow grant it the power to do...something. As Acemoglu says, \"what does it mean to double AI's capabilities?\"\n\nNo, really, what does \"more\" actually mean? While one might argue that it'll mean faster generative processes, there really is no barometer for what \"better\" looks like, and perhaps that's why ChatGPT, Claude and other LLMs have yet to take a leap beyond being able to generate stuff. Anthropic's Claude LLM might be \"best-in-class,\" but that only means that it's faster and more accurate, which is cool but not the future or revolutionary or even necessarily good.\n\nI should add that these are the questions I - and other people writing about AI - should've been asking the whole time. Generative AI generates outputs based on text-based inputs and requests, requests that can be equally specific and intricate, yet the answer is always, as obvious as it sounds, generated fresh, meaning that there is no actual \"knowledge\" or, indeed, \"intelligence\" operating in any part of the process. As a result, it's easy to see how this gets better, but far, far harder - if not impossible - to see how generative AI leads any further than where we're already at.\n\nHow does GPT - a transformer-based model that generates answers probabilistically (as in what the next part of the generation is most likely to be the correct one) based entirely on training data - do anything more than generate paragraphs of occasionally-accurate text? How do any of these models even differentiate when most of them are trained on the same training data that they're already running out of?\n\nThe training data crisis is one that doesn't get enough attention, but it's sufficiently dire that it has the potential to halt (or dramatically slow) any AI development in the near future. As one paper, published in the journal Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, found, in order to achieve a linear improvement in model performance, you need an exponentially large amount of data.\n\nOr, put another way, each additional step becomes increasingly (and exponentially) more expensive to take. This infers a steep financial cost -- not merely in just obtaining the data, but also the compute required to process it -- with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei saying that the AI models currently in development will cost as much as $1bn to train, and within three years we may see models that cost as much as \"ten or a hundred billion\" dollars, or roughly three times the GDP of Estonia.\n\nAcemoglu doubts that LLMs can become superintelligent, and that even his most conservative estimates of productivity gains \"may turn out to be too large if AI models prove less successful in improving upon more complex tasks.\" And I think that's really the root of the problem.\n\nAll of this excitement, every second of breathless hype has been built on this idea that the artificial intelligence industry - led by generative AI - will somehow revolutionize everything from robotics to the supply chain, despite the fact that generative AI is not actually going to solve these problems because it isn't built to do so.\n\nWhile Acemoglu has some positive things to say -- for example, that AI models could be trained to help scientists conceive of and test new materials (which happened last year) -- his general verdict is quite harsh: that using generative AI and \"too much automation too soon could create bottlenecks and other problems for firms that no longer have the flexibility and trouble-shooting capabilities that human capital provides.\" In essence, replacing humans with AI might break everything if you're one of those bosses that doesn't actually know what the fuck it is they're talking about.\n\nThe report also includes a palette-cleanser for the quirked-up AI hype fiend on page 6, where Goldman Sachs' Joseph Briggs argues that generative AI will \"likely lead to significant economic upside\" based -- and I shit you not -- entirely on the idea that AI will replace workers in some jobs and then allow them to get jobs in other fields. Briggs also argues that \"the full automation of AI exposed tasks that are likely to occur over a longer horizon could generate significant cost savings,\" which assumes that generative AI (or AI itself) will actually replace these tasks.\n\nI should also add that unlike every other interview in the report, Briggs continually mixes up AI and generative AI, and at one point suggests that \"recent generative AI advances\" are \"foreshadowing the emergence of a \"superintelligence.\"\n\nI included this part of the report because sometimes -- very rarely -- I get somebody suggesting I'm not considering both sides. The reason I don't generally include both sides of this argument is that the AI hype side generally makes arguments based on the assumption that things will happen, such as a transformer model that probabilistically generates the next part of a sentence or a picture will somehow gain sentience.\n\nFrancois Chollet -- an AI researcher at Google -- recently argued that LLMs can't lead to AGI, explaining (in detail) that models like GPT are simply not capable of the kind of reasoning and theorizing that makes a human brain work. Chollet also notes that even models specifically built to complete the tasks of the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (a benchmark test for AI skills and true \"intelligence\") are only doing so because they've been fed millions of datapoints of people solving the test, which is kind of like measuring somebody's IQ based on them studying really hard to complete an IQ test, except even dumber.\n\nThe reason I'm suddenly bringing up superintelligences -- or AGI (artificial general intelligence) -- is because throughout every defense of generative AI is a deliberate attempt to get around the problem that generative AI doesn't really automate many tasks. While it's good at generating answers or creating things based on a request, there's no real interaction with the task, or the person giving it the task, or consideration of what the task needs at all -- just the abstraction of \"thing said\" to \"output generated.\"\n\nTasks like taking someone's order and relaying it to the kitchen at a fast food restaurant might seem elementary to most people (I won't write easy, working in fast food sucks), but it isn't for an AI model that generates answers without really understanding the meaning of any of the words. Last year, Wendy's announced that it would integrate its generative \"FreshAI\" ordering system into some restaurants, and a few weeks ago it was revealed that the system requires human intervention on 14% of the orders.On Reddit, one user noted that Wendy's AI regularly required three attempts to get it to understand them, and would cut you off if you weren't speaking fast enough.\n\nWhite Castle, which implemented a similar system in partnership with Samsung and SoundHound, fared little better, with 10% of orders requiring human intervention. Last month, McDonald's discontinued its own AI ordering system -- which it built with IBM and deployed to more than 100 restaurants -- likely because it just wasn't very good, with one customer rang up for literally hundreds of chicken nuggets. However, to be clear, McDonald's system wasn't based on generative AI.\n\nIf nothing else, this illustrates the disconnect between those building AI systems, and how much (or, rather, how little) they understand the jobs they wish to eliminate. A little humility goes a long way.\n\nAnother thing to note is that, on top of generative AI cocking up these orders, Wendy's still requires human beings to make the goddamn food. Despite all of this hype, all of this media attention, all of this incredible investment, the supposed \"innovations\" don't even seem capable of replacing the jobs that they're meant to -- not that I think they should, just that I'm tired of being told that this future is inevitable.\n\nThe reality is that generative AI isn't good at replacing jobs, but commoditizing distinct acts of labor, and, in the process, the early creative jobs that help people build portfolios to advance in their industries.\n\nThe freelancers having their livelihoods replaced by bosses using generative AI aren't being \"replaced\" so much as they're being shown how little respect many bosses have for their craft, or for the customer it allegedly serves. Copy editors and concept artists provide far-more-valuable work than any generative AI can, yet an economy dominated by managers who don't appreciate (or participate in) labor means that these jobs are under assault from LLMs pumping out stuff that all looks and sounds the same to the point that copywriters are now being paid to help them sound more human.\n\nOne of the fundamental misunderstandings of the bosses replacing these workers with generative AI is that you are not just asking for a thing, but outsourcing the risk and responsibility. When I hire an artist to make a logo, my expectation is that they'll listen to me, then add their own flair, then we'll go back and forth with drafts until we have something I like. I'm paying them not just for their time, their years learning their craft and the output itself, but so that the ultimate burden of production is not my own, and their experience means that they can adapt to circumstances that I might not have thought of. These are not things that you can train in a dataset, because they're derived from experiences inside and outside of the creative process.\n\nWhile one can \"teach\" a generative AI what a billion images look like, AI does not get hand cramps, or a call at 8PM saying that it \"needs it to pop more.\" It does not have moods, nor can it infer them from written or visual media, because human emotions are extremely weird, as are our moods, our bodies, and our general existences. I realize all of this is a little flowery, but even the most mediocre copy ever written is, on some level, a collection of experiences. And fully replacing any creative is so very unlikely if you're doing so based on copying a million pieces of someone else's homework.\n\nThe most fascinating part of the report (page 10) is an interview with Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs' Head of Global Equity Research. Covello isn't a name you'll have heard unless you are, for whatever reason, a big semiconductor-head, but he's consistently been on the right side of history, named as the top semiconductor analyst by II Research for years, successfully catching the downturn in fundamentals in multiple major chip firms far before others did.\n\nAnd Jim, in no uncertain terms, thinks that the generative AI bubble is full of shit.\n\nCovello believes that the combined expenditure of all parts of the generative AI boom -- data centers, utilities and applications -- will cost a trillion dollars in the next several years alone, and asks one very simple question: \"what trillion dollar problem will AI solve?\" He notes that \"replacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions [he's] witnessed in the last thirty years.\"\n\nOne particular myth Covello dispels is comparing generative AI \"to the early days of the internet,\" noting that \"even in its infancy, the internet was a low-cost technology solution that enabled e-commerce to replace costly incumbent solutions,\" and that \"AI technology is exceptionally expensive, and to justify those costs, the technology must be able to solve complex problems, which it isn't designed to do.\"\n\nCovello also dismisses the suggestion that tech starts off expensive and gets cheaper over time as \"revisionist history,\" and that \"the tech world is too complacent in the assumption that AI costs will decline substantially over time.\" He specifically notes that the only reason that Moore's law was capable of enabling smaller, faster cheaper chips was because competitors like AMD forced Intel (and other companies to compete) -- a thing that doesn't really seem to be happening with Nvidia, which has a near-stranglehold on the GPUs required to handle generative AI.\n\nWhile there are companies making GPUs aimed at the AI market (especially in China, where US trade restrictions prevent local companies from buying high-powered cards like the A100 for fears they'll be diverted to the military), they're not doing so at the same scale, and Covello notes that \"the market is too complacent about the certainty of cost declines.\"\n\nHe also notes that the costs are so high that even if they were to come down, they'd have to do so dramatically, and that the comparison to the early days of the internet (where businesses often relied on $64,000 servers from Sun Microsystems and there was no AWS, Linode, or Azure) \"pales in comparison\" to the costs of AI, and that's even without including the replacement of the power grid, a necessity to keep this boom going.\n\nI could probably write up Covello's entire interview, because it's nasty. Covello adds that the common adage that people didn't think smartphones would be big was false. He sat through hundreds of presentations in the early 2000s, many of them including roadmaps that accurately fit how smartphones rolled out, and that no such roadmap (or killer app) for AI has been found.\n\nHe notes that big tech companies now have no choice but to engage in the AI arms race given the hype (which will continue the trend of massive spending), and he believes that there are \"low odds of AI-related revenue expansion,\" in part because he doesn't believe that generative AI will make workers smarter, just more capable of finding better information faster, and that any advantages that generative AI gives you can be \"arbitraged away\" because the tech can be used everywhere, and thus you can't, as a company, raise prices.\n\nIn plain English: generative AI isn't making any money for anybody because it doesn't actually make companies that use it any extra money. Efficiency is useful, but it is not company-defining. He also adds that hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft will \"also garner incremental revenue\" from AI -- not the huge returns they're perhaps counting on, given their vast AI-related expenditure over the past two years.\n\nThis is damning for many reasons, chief of which is that the biggest thing that artificial intelligence is meant to do is be smart, and make you smarter. Being able to access information faster might make you better at your job, but that's efficiency rather than allowing you to do something new. Generative AI isn't creating new jobs, it isn't creating new ways to do your job, and it isn't making anybody any money -- and the path to boosting revenues is unclear.\n\nCovello ends with one important and brutal note: that the more time that passes without significant AI applications, the more challenging \"the AI story will become,\" with corporate profitability likely floating this bubble as long as it takes for the tech industry to hit a more difficult economic period.\n\nHe also adds his own prediction -- \"investor enthusiasm may begin to fade\" If \"important use cases don't start to become more apparent in the next 12-18 months.\"\n\nI think he's being optimistic.\n\nWhile I won't recount the rest of the report, one theme brought up repeatedly is the idea that America's power grid is literally not ready for generative AI. In an interview former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous (page 15), the report details numerous nightmarish problems that the growth of generative AI is causing to the power grid, such as:\n\nIn essence, on top of generative AI not having any killer apps, not meaningfully increasing productivity or GDP, not generating any revenue, not creating new jobs or massively changing existing industries, it also requires America to totally rebuild its power grid, which Janous regrettably adds the US has kind of forgotten how to do.\n\nPerhaps Sam Altman's energy breakthrough could be these fucking AI companies being made to pay for new power infrastructure.\n\nThe reason I so agonizingly picked apart this report is that if Goldman Sachs is saying this, things are very, very bad. It also directly attacks the specific hype-tactics of AI fanatics -- the sense that generative AI will create new jobs (it hasn't in 18 months), the sense that costs will come down (they're haven't, and there doesn't seem to be a path to them doing so in a way that matters), and that there's incredible demand for these products (there isn't, and there's no path to it existing).\n\nEven Goldman Sachs, when describing the efficiency benefits of AI, added that while it was able to create an AI that updated historical data in its company models more quickly than doing so manually, it cost six times as much to do so.\n\nThe remaining defense is also one of the most annoying -- that OpenAI has something we don't know about. A big, sexy, secret technology that will eternally break the bones of every hater.\n\nYet, I have a counterpoint: no it doesn't.\n\nSeriously, Mira Murati, CTO of OpenAI, said a few weeks ago that the models it has in its labs are not much more advanced than those that are publicly-available.\n\nThat's my answer to all of this. There is no magic trick. There is no secret thing that Sam Altman is going to reveal to us in a few months that makes me eat crow, or some magical tool that Microsoft or Google \"pops out that makes all of this worth it.\n\nThere isn't. I'm telling you there isn't.\n\nGenerative AI, as I said back in March, is peaking, if it hasn't already peaked. It cannot do much more than it is currently doing, other than doing more of it faster with some new inputs. It isn't getting much more efficient. Sequoia hype-man David Cahn gleefully mentioned in a recent blog that Nvidia's B100 will \"have 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost,\" which doesn't mean a goddamn thing, because generative AI isn't going to gain sentience or intelligence and consciousness because it's able to run faster.\n\nGenerative AI is not going to become AGI, nor will it become the kind of artificial intelligence you've seen in science fiction. Ultra-smart assistants like Jarvis from Iron Man would require a form of consciousness that no technology currently -- or may ever -- have -- which is the ability to both process and understand information flawlessly and make decisions based on experience, which, if I haven't been clear enough, are all entirely distinct things.\n\nGenerative AI at best processes information when it trains on data, but at no point does it \"learn\" or \"understand,\" because everything it's doing is based on ingesting training data and developing answers based on a mathematical sense or probability rather than any appreciation or comprehension of the material itself. LLMs are entirely different pieces of technology to that of \"an artificial intelligence\" in the sense that the AI bubble is hyping, and it's disgraceful that the AI industry has taken so much money and attention with such a flagrant, offensive lie.\n\nThe jobs market isn't going to change because of generative AI, because generative AI can't actually do many jobs, and it's mediocre at the few things that it's capable of doing. While it's a useful efficiency tool, said efficiency is based off of a technology that is extremely expensive, and I believe that at some point AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI will have to increase prices -- or begin to collapse under the weight of a technology that has no path to profitability.\n\nIf there were some secret way that this would all get fixed, wouldn't Microsoft, or Meta, or Google, or Amazon -- whose CEO of AWS compared the generative AI hype to the Dotcom bubble in February -- have taken advantage of it? And why am I hearing that OpenAI is already trying to raise another multi-billion dollar round after raising an indeterminate amount at an $80 billion valuation in February? Isn't its annualized revenue $3.4 billion? Why does it need more money?\n\nI'll give you an educated guess: because whatever they -- and other generative AI hucksters -- have today is obviously, painfully not the future. Generative AI is not the future, but a regurgitation of the past, a useful-yet-not-groundbreaking way to quickly generate \"new\" data from old that costs far too much to make the compute and energy demands worth it. Google grew its emissions by 48% in the last five years chasing a technology that made its search engine even worse than it already is, with little to show for it.\n\nIt's genuinely remarkable how many people have been won over by this remarkable con -- this unscrupulous manipulation of capital markets, the media and brainless executives disconnected from production -- all thanks to a tech industry that's disconnected itself from building useful technology.\n\nI've been asked a few times what I think will burst this bubble, and I maintain that part of the collapse will be investor dissent, punishing one of the major providers (Microsoft or Google, most likely) for a massive investment in an industry that produces little actual revenue. However, I think the collapse will be a succession of bad events -- like Figma pausing its new AI feature after it immediately plagiarized Apple's weather app, likely as a result of training data that included it -- crested by one large one, such as a major AI company like chatbot company Character.ai (which raised $150m in funding, and The Information claims might sell to one of the big tech companies) collapsing under the weight of an unsustainable business model built on unprofitable tech.\n\nPerhaps it's Cognition AI, the company that raised $175 million at a $2 billion valuation in April to make an \"AI software engineer\" that was so good that it had to fake a demo of it completing a software development project on Upwork.\n\nBasically, there's going to be a moment that spooks a venture capital firm into pushing one of its startups to sell, or the sudden, unexpected yet very obvious collapse of a major player. For OpenAI and Anthropic, there really is no path to profitability -- only one that includes burning further billions of dollars in the hope that they discover something, anything that might be truly innovative or indicative of the future, rather than further iterations of generative AI, which at best is an extremely expensive new way to process data.\n\nI see no situation where OpenAI and Anthropic continue to iterate on Large Language Models in perpetuity, as at some point Microsoft, Amazon and Google decide (or are forced to decide) that cloud compute welfare isn't a business model. Without a real, tangible breakthrough -- one that would require them to leave the world of LLMs entirely, in my opinion -- it's unclear how generative AI companies can survive.\n\nGenerative AI is locked in the Red Queen's Race, burning money to make money in an attempt to prove that they one day will make more money, despite there being no clear path to doing so.\n\nI feel a little crazy every time I write one of these pieces, because it's patently ridiculous. Generative AI is unprofitable, unsustainable, and fundamentally limited in what it can do thanks to the fact that it's probabilistically generating an answer. It's been eighteen months since this bubble inflated, and since then very little has actually happened involving technology doing new stuff, just an iterative exploration of the very clear limits of what an AI model that generates answers can produce, with the answer being \"something that is, at times, sort of good.\"\n\nIt's obvious. It's well-documented. Generative AI costs far too much, isn't getting cheaper, uses too much power, and doesn't do enough to justify its existence. There are no killer apps, and no killer apps on the horizon. And there are no answers.\n\nI don't know why more people aren't saying this as loudly as they can. I understand that big tech desperately needs this to be the next hypergrowth market as they haven't got any others, but pursuing this quasi-useful environmental disaster-causing cloud efficiency boondoggle will send shockwaves through the industry.", "source": {"uri": "wheresyoured.at", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We imagine what ChatGPT will look like in 20 years, but not how we will connect with it in our old age.\n\nI mention this because I was recently asked for a favor by a family member. They wanted recommendations for a phone for their elderly friend. Unfortunately, I was hard-pressed to find a device capable of everything required. However, as I was researching I realized that AI could conceivably do the majority of these tasks with ease but it's an area that we rarely see developers mention.\n\nAI is fantastic for accessibility, and I've said this before, but it is important to look at how AI will improve our lives as we get older and how it can help our elderly relatives now.\n\nNone of us like to think about the time when we do not understand the new technology. I'm sure we've all wondered how elderly people can't seem to figure out something as simple as a printer. However, it's a fact of life that, eventually, we will be the ones struggling to figure out how to change the volume on the TV. This is an area where, surprisingly, AI can be a big benefit. I realize that AI sounds complicated, and it is, but it should be noted that the complication never really features in using the software.\n\nFor instance, how a large language AI model is trained and functions is a nightmare of technical terms and jargon. However, actually using ChatGPT is simple and easy. This comes into play when you realize that AI can make every program simple and easy to understand, primarily by working in the background of the device and performing most of the complex tasks.\n\nSeveral features have recently been announced that use AI to better the experience and usability of phones and devices. For instance, Google recently introduced Circle To Search and Ask With Video, two features that use AI in conjunction with other parts of the phone to improve the overall usability of Google Search. While they aren't aimed directly at the elderly, they are features that will greatly benefit them and couldn't be simpler to use.\n\nOne of the worries about older relatives is their safety when they're alone. For instance, one of the biggest fears is that the elderly relative will fall over with no one around to help.\n\nIf you have ever tried to use Siri to make a call you will know it can be a lesson in frustration. This is partially because the voice recognition for Apple's assistant isn't currently great, but that is likely to change with the introduction of Apple Intelligence. However, the smarter AI becomes, the better it gets at hearing our voices and understanding what we need. For instance, an AI assistant could hear you, place the call and relay all the important information to the emergency services.\n\nAnother benefit is AI's ability to summarize and explain what is happening with our devices, especially as our eyesight gets worse. For instance, as you get older it becomes harder and harder to read a digital screen, but an AI can read and explain everything in an easy-to-understand format, making it much easier to understand and avoiding the embarrassing moment of asking someone what it says. This is especially important for emails or private documents you might not want someone else reading.\n\nIf you have been paying attention to the news you will likely have noticed an increase in fraudulent and spam calls. One of the most concerning involves cloning an official number to make it appear more realistic. This is a concern for the elderly who tend to be the main victims of these kinds of crimes. However, AI can be a big help in dealing with these situations. For instance, Google Gemini recently announced a new feature that will alert users that a call is likely fraudulent.\n\nHowever, AI can also be a friend when necessary, especially when dealing with one of the biggest issues affecting people, loneliness. While everyone has an issue with being alone, there is a huge problem with elderly people being alone and having no one to talk to. however, this is an area where AI can be a big help, so long as it's used carefully.\n\nThe first way AI can help is by making it easier to pick up the phone and call someone. One reason it can be hard is that you may have failing hearing, making calls a nightmare.

It will ensure development and adhere to a robust ethical framework by establishing regulatory measures that uphold human rights in AI development and deployment.\n\nThe ICT Division, in collaboration with relevant ministries, industry, academia, and civil society, will take necessary steps to establish the institutional framework for the policy implementation, officials said.\n\nIt will set up an independent National Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (NAICE).\n\nThe NAICE will be responsible for coordination and monitoring of AI initiatives using key performance indicators and evaluation of AI initiatives' social, economic, and environmental impacts, guiding adjustments for maximum benefits and risk mitigation.\n\nIt will facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among stakeholders, including government agencies, industry, academia, and civil society. It will ensure that any measures taken to regulate the technology are proportional to the risk and balanced to encourage innovation.\n\nThe government will form a high-level national AI advisory council to guide the implementation of sectoral AI initiatives.\n\nThe draft said the legal and regulatory frameworks are necessary for AI policy implementation.\n\nThe National Strategy for AI will be framed, and it will be updated every two years in accordance with the advancement of AI worldwide.\n\nThe strategy will include data retention policies, deal with the legal issues of data governance and ownership and focus on interoperability and data exchange.\n\nAccording to IMF's economist Giovanni Melina, AI can increase productivity, boost economic growth, and lift incomes. However, it could also wipe out millions of jobs and widen inequality.\n\nIMF's research has shown how AI is poised to reshape the global economy. It could endanger 33 percent of jobs in advanced economies, 24 percent in emerging economies, and 18 percent in low-income countries.\n\nBut, on the brighter side, it also brings enormous potential to enhance the productivity of existing jobs for which AI can be a complementary tool and to create new jobs and even new industries.\n\nMelina said most emerging market economies and low-income countries have smaller shares of high-skilled jobs than advanced economies, and so will likely be less affected and face fewer immediate disruptions from AI.\n\n\"At the same time, many of these countries lack the infrastructure or skilled workforces needed to harness AI's benefits, which could worsen inequality among nations.\"\n\nThe economist said the policy priority for emerging markets

With its ability to compute massive amounts of information, run simulations in seconds, generate content in the fraction of the time it would take a human, and automate cumbersome tasks to free up personal time, AI is making waves in every industry. What could make it even better? Blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding AI And Blockchain\n\nAI refers to any technology that allows computers to learn and process data similar to a human brain. This comes down to programming, not superpowers. AI engines are programmed to distill large amounts of data into usable outputs at lightning speed. ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa, chatbots and autonomous vehicles are all examples of AI-powered technology.\n\nBlockchain is a database or ledger that lives on multiple computers across a network. Every transaction that happens on the blockchain is recorded and time-stamped, so anything that happens in the blockchain can be tracked. Blockchain became famous for its role in cryptocurrency exchange, but it is also used for a variety of applications such as decentralized finance, NFTs and smart contracts.\n\nWhen AI And Blockchain Meet\n\nAt present, AI engines are housed on supercomputers, which are then accessed by end users via the internet. But if AI were to be housed on a blockchain, there would be immediate benefits.\n\n1. Blockchian could make AI even faster. AI engines can compute massive amounts of data quickly, but blockchain could make this process even faster. Currently, AI is limited in speed by the power of the supercomputers that host it. In a blockchain model, many computers could be used to digest information, potentially allowing AI engines to create results even more quickly.\n\n2. Blockchain could solve the question of where AI gets its information. One of the biggest problems with AI today is that users cannot see exactly where AI sources the information it uses to generate content. Blockchain could help solve this because it keeps a record of every single transaction made within it. More transparency through recording of AI transactions could lead to a greater understanding of and trust in AI.\n\n3. Blockchain could make AI more secure. It's terrifying to think of the damage a bad actor with access to AI could do to our world, from fake news stories about election results to deepfake videos of world leaders in compromising positions. As AI is able to generate content and compute data at lightning speed, a hacker could do immeasurable damage in seconds. Blockchain could help to prevent this scenario from coming to fruition. Because the blockchain is decentralized, no one party can control the entire thing, which makes it significantly harder to hack into. While a hacker may be able to get into a node, they cannot access the whole system, limiting the power for destruction.\n\nThe Downside Of Storing AI On Blockchain\n\nPrivacy concerns are a major contributor to the hesitancy people feel about AI today. Thought leaders are currently debating whether AI can be trusted to keep our most private information safe, from health records to banking information to intellectual property and more. There is good reason for this concern. Any public AI uses all information it is given as part of its knowledge base, and this knowledge base is used to create new outputs. That means any personal information put into a public AI like ChatGPT may be disseminated out to other users. Private AIs are able to keep information inputs accessible only to authorized users, but security concerns still exist.\n\nPrivacy concerns may only be compounded by storing AI on a blockchain, as it no longer is the property of a single party who is responsible for security but is now hosted in multiple locations under the purview of many different computer owners.\n\nScalability may also be an issue. Blockchain is infamous for its limitations of scale. With more blockchain applications fighting over fewer available computers, performance can struggle and growth can stagnate. This could limit the explosive growth of AI engines or slow them down to sub-par speed.\n\nAlso, as a counterpoint to the bullet above, more computers may be able to digest more information faster, but only if the networks they use to communicate with each other are fast. One server that hosts an AI can be faster than transferring data over a slow network among many disparate nodes. In that case, blockchain would hinder AI's performance instead of enhance it.\n\nAn Exciting Time For Tech\n\nThe advent of AI and blockchain have transformed our global economy. Put together, there is no limit to what they can accomplish to solve real-world problems and create opportunities for businesses and investors alike.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

With cloud-based network security tools, however, you can easily and quickly install newer versions of the same software you've already licensed.\n\n\"If you need to make a change, you don't actually log on to the servers,\" said Robert Lowry, vice president of security at The Lifetime Value Company. \"You just deploy the new change. Tear down and replace. Same thing with patching. Don't patch, replace -- you spin up something fresh.\"\n\nAn even greater boost to network security comes with the assistance that automation provides to teams sifting through gigabytes of logs and other data searching for anomalies and signs of threats. AI will speed up that process as it learns from its own experiences and constantly adds new data to its training model. A recent survey of CISOs and other technology-focused executives found that 70% planned to use AI in cybersecurity and threat detection.\n\nAviv Abramovich, head of security services product management at network-security provider Check Point, said AI and ML tools had dramatically improved the threat-detection capabilities of the company's products, thanks to AI's pattern-recognition abilities.\n\n\"Using machine learning and deep learning, we were able to increase our accuracy in detecting and preventing new threats and reducing false positives considerably,\" said Abramovich. \"We had 90% less false positives and 40% to 50% more detecting more malicious activity than before.\"\n\nHe added that AI's real advantages lie in its ability \"to identify the things that are really malicious versus the one that might look like it or look just abnormal, but they're actually not malicious.\"\n\nOn a less analytical side, Check Point has introduced what it calls Infinity Copilot, an AI-based assistant that receives instructions in natural language and helps security teams and administrators see where overlapping/conflicting policies may exist.\n\nCopilot and similar AI assistants can provide guidance and suggestions for mitigation, create proposed policies, and troubleshoot issues for quick ticket resolution. They will also boost team productivity and relieve stress on staff.\n\n\"We are now also able to use AI not only for better threat prevention, but also for security administrative tasks,\" Abramovich says. \"We have an AI assistant that you can ask to do all sorts of things. You can actually write to it in human language.\"\n\nOf course, AI can aid attackers as well. A Check Point blog post from early January 2023, six weeks after ChatGPT became generally accessible, detailed how low-skilled coders were already using the AI tool to create information-stealing malware, ransomware and phishing emails.\n\nA study released in December 2022 by the Finnish telecommunication authority Traficom predicted \"a new arms race that exploits cutting-edge AI technologies for both attack and defense.\"\n\nIt also foresaw accelerated timelines of software patching as AI quickly exploits disclosed threats, and deprecation of voice authentication and other biometric methods as deepfakes abound.\n\nScariest of all, the study expects that by 2027 or 2028, there might be AI-powered malware that can independently change attack strategies and alter its own code to evade defenses, \"living off the land\" by using AI code libraries built into PCs instead of carrying its own learning models.\n\n\"Winning this new arms race will boil down to attackers and defenders vying to adopt new AI advances first,\" the Traficom report said. \"New security solutions will have to leverage AI advances before attackers do.\"\n\nOne question about AI is whether it will generate anything new, or just speed up what humans already do, for better or for worse.\n\n\"I don't think AI is bringing any net benefits. Quite the opposite for cybersecurity, at least for the foreseeable future,\" said Julian Mihai, CISO of Penn Medicine. \"It's much easier to exploit a bug than to prevent it from being exploitable throughout your entire environment. So there's an asymmetry of efforts there.\"\n\nDavid Sinclair, founder and CEO of 4FreedomMobile, said that AI has its limits, and that human supervision will continue to be necessary to interpret and act up what AI finds -- and what AI might recommend.\n\n\"AI is going to have an enormous impact in terms that it's going to automate a lot of the work both for attack and for defense,\" he says. \"But you've got to have a human head at the top that's getting the big picture. Because AI, at least at the level of development that AI is at today, it's really good at identifying the trees. It's not good at seeing the forest.\"\n\nHowever, Check Point's Abramovich was more upbeat about AI's potential to augment rather than replace human intuition and intelligence, especially when it comes to cybersecurity.\n\n\"What AI is doing is generating its own intelligence from the intelligence that already exists,\" he said. \"The importance of using AI is to create more intelligence to help you do things better.\"", "source": {"uri": "scmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SC Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_wagenseil@scmagazine.com", "name": "Paul Wagenseil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Network security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Check Point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False positives and false negatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-premises software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firewall (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Threat (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://files.scmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010124_ai_security.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This week we review its assessment of the risks of AI.\n\nFresh perspectives on known risks\n\nThe interim report provides new perspectives on some of the well-rehearsed risks of AI.\n\nMalicious use\n\nWe already understand that generative AI amplifies many existing risks of misinformation, disinformation, scams and fraud because it enables the generation of content at greater speeds, scale and degrees of personalisation than previously possible. The interim report notes that \"research has found between January to February of 2023, there was a 135% increase in 'novel social engineering attacks' in a sample of email accounts, which is thought to correspond to the widespread adoption of ChatGPT\".\n\nBut more tellingly, the interim report points out the conversational abilities of general purpose AI adds new dimensions to the risks of online misinformation/disinformation:\n\n\"An underexplored frontier is the use of conversational general-purpose AI systems to persuade users over multiple turns of dialogue. In one study, human-human or human-general-purpose AI pairs debated over a cycle of opinion-and-rebuttal, and general-purpose AI systems were found to be as persuasive as humans. Another study in which general-purpose AI systems attempted to dissuade humans of their belief in conspiracy theories over three conversational turns found reductions in reported belief in those theories of 15-20% that endured for up to two months.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the threat to social cohesion and democracy, the interim report also observes the main bottleneck for actors trying to have a large-scale impact with fake content may not be generating content but distributing it at scale. This suggests responses currently being introduced by social media companies and governments to address misinformation/disinformation in current online distribution channels could be adapted to help staunch the impact of AI-generated misinformation/disinformation.\n\nCyber offence\n\nAI, because it can write code in response to plain language prompts from users, \"may lower the barrier to entry of more sophisticated cyber attacks, so the number of people capable of such attacks might increase\".\n\nBut in a 'be alarmed, but don't panic' approach, the interim report observes that:\n\nBias\n\nThe interim report says, despite considerable research efforts, \"mitigating bias remains an unsolved challenge\". This is because AI is learning bias from us humans, and the failure of explicit measures to eradicate bias from AI only shows how deeply entrenched we humans have entrenched bias:\n\n\"While developers may attempt to explicitly address bias during model fine-tuning, AI models can still pick up on implicit associations between features or perpetuate significant biases and stereotypes even when prompts do not contain explicit demographic identifiers.\"\n\nPrivacy\n\nIn theory, because AI is only learning correlations between billions of data points in the training data, AI should not store and be able to regurgitate information about an individual even if the individual's information is buried in that pile of training data. As the interim report notes, nobody knows why however:\n\n\"Academic studies have shown that some of this training data may be memorised by the general-purpose AI model, or may be extractable using adversarial inputs, enabling users to infer information about individuals whose data was collected or even reconstruct entire training examples.\"\n\nEven where the training data is anonymised or the output is a composition of text and images, AI could enable very fine-grained 'reverse search' across the internet to find individuals.\n\nInequality\n\nThe interim report notes economists \"hold a wide range of views about the magnitude and timing of these effects, with some expecting widespread economic transformation in the next ten years, while others do not think a step-change in AI-related automation and productivity growth is imminent\".\n\nThe optimists point out that while previous waves of automation have destroyed jobs, they have created new jobs as well: more than 60% of employment in 2018 was in jobs with titles that did not exist in 1940.\n\nHowever, the pessimists respond that it will be different this time because, unlike previous automation waves, AI can replace jobs requiring cognitive skills and judgment: 60% of current jobs could be affected by the introduction of general-purpose AI in developed economies.\n\nWhile not coming down one way or the other, the interim report makes some more interesting points on the potential impact of AI on wealth inequalities in an AI-restructured economy:\n\nMalfunctions\n\nThe interim report proposes a useful taxonomy of AI failures to perform:\n\nImpossible tasks (tasks beyond a general purpose AI's capabilities) should be self-evident, for example not being able to answer prompts requiring facts post-dating its training data. But often there can be confusion identifiying what is and is not possible with AI, for positive and negative reasons. On the positive side, AI keeps surprising its designers with its capabilities and on the negative side, there are \"mismeasurements, misapprehensions or miscommunication around what a model can do, and the misinformed deployments that result\". The interim report gives the example of AI which, while scoring in the 88th percentile for law exams, provided to be unreliable in the real world of legal practice environments.\n\nMisapprehensions about functionality also can arise from technical difficulties in designing representative evaluations of performance for general-purpose AI systems, making definite statements about functionality difficult.\n\nShortcomings of an AI model may only become apparent when used in the real world: For example, while tests show AI to be very good at code writing, experience in the real world suggests AI could lead to the potential introduction of critical overlooked bugs.\n\nMarket concentration\n\nReflecting the concerns voiced by many anti-trust regulators around the world, the interim report says there are inherent characteristics in general-purpose AI that tend towards market concentration:\n\n\"...general-purpose AI systems benefit from scale. More compute-intensive large-scale models tend to outperform smaller ones, giving rise to economies of scale: large-scale general-purpose AI systems are in higher demand due to their superior performance, driving down their costs per customer. High user numbers also have network effects: as more users interact with these models, they generate large amounts of additional training data that can be used to improve the models' performance.\"\n\nHowever, as we discussed several weeks ago, the picture, even on the evidence from the regulators themselves, seems more nuanced and fluid.\n\nHighlighting other risks\n\nBeyond these well-known risks, the interim report also seeks to elevate discussion of the following risks of AI.\n\nIntellectual Property (IP)\n\nThe need to train AI on large amounts of data, often containing copyrighted works used without consent from the data's creators, posing a challenge to traditional IP laws.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nTraining AI already consumes 4% of US electricity supply. At anticipated growth rates of compute capacity required to train an AI model, by 2030 the largest training run for a single model would consume 90 TWh, over half of total US data centre electricity consumption in 2022. The improvement in energy efficiency of computer hardware - while impressive at 26% per annum, cannot keep up.\n\nA lesser known impact is water consumption, which is needed to cool large computer facilities. The interim report notes some researchers predict water consumption by AI could ramp up to billions of cubic metres by 2027.\n\nLoss of human control\n\n'Loss of control' scenarios are potential future scenarios in which society can no longer meaningfully constrain some advanced general-purpose AI agents, even if it becomes clear they are causing harm, a real world version of HAL in Space Odyssey 2001.\n\nThere is scientific consensus that this is a low risk with current AI models because they are limited to their training and do not interact with the real world. However, as we discussed several weeks ago, the push is to develop general-purpose AI agents which are systems that can autonomously interact with the world, plan, and pursue goals.

Our exclusive video interview and blogs give insights into the opportunities and challenges ahead.\n\nCanalys Principal Analyst Ishan Dutt, interviewed Steve Long, Senior Vice President of the Intelligent Device Group (IDG) at Lenovo, to discuss the company's strategy and how it intends to seize the massive opportunities emerging around AI.\n\nLenovo emphasizes its \"pocket-to-cloud\" strategy to unlock opportunities in hybrid AI\n\nAs AI PCs transition from concept to practical application, leading PC vendors are detailing how this innovative product category integrates into their overarching strategies. Each company's AI strategy -- whether Dell's \"four pillar\" approach, HP's emphasis on edge computing and industry-specific solutions, or Lenovo's hybrid \"AI for All\" initiative -- aims to deliver a comprehensive user experience that utilizes AI technology.\n\nAt the Lenovo Tech World 2023 event, Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing, introduced the company's \"pocket-to-cloud\" strategy and announced a US$1 billion investment in AI innovation. This strategic shift underscores Lenovo's transformation from a primarily hardware-focused vendor to a provider of holistic end-to-end solutions and services, addressing the IT transformation needs of its diverse customer base.\n\nThe challenge for IT decision-makers lies in determining the optimal timing and methods for integrating AI into their operations, given the ambiguity in potential applications, increasing complexity, regulatory hurdles, and budget limitations. Steve Long reflecting on this issue, noted, \"Customers more and more want to know what can they do with [technology] and how can they drive outcomes?\" In such a landscape, gaining a first-mover advantage is crucial, as early adopters often set the standards for how AI is experienced and utilized by customers.\n\nLenovo is in a strong position with its extensive portfolio within and beyond hardware, and its prominence in the commercial PC market. Strong engagement with its vast commercial customer base, many of which are navigating the AI landscape, can close the gap between interest in and actual adoption of AI products and services.\n\nLenovo's \"3 Ps\" - Personalization, Productivity and a Protected experience - are key to driving AI PC adoption\n\nPersonalization\n\nWhile most users' initial experiences with AI functionalities have been through cloud-based applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) or large vision models (LVMs), the emergence of AI PCs presents vendors like Lenovo with the chance to deliver more tailored experiences. These experiences are powered by on-device models that leverage individual or enterprise data, emphasizing the \"personal\" aspect of personal computers. This can help turn potential challenges into opportunities. For instance, Microsoft's restrictions on deploying Copilot in Mainland China could be a setback for major PC vendors. However, Lenovo can leverage this situation with its own developments, such as the Tianxi AI and the personal AI assistant Xiaotian. Lenovo also plans to introduce its proprietary AI software and LLMs alongside Copilot in markets outside Mainland China in the future.\n\nProductivity\n\nA key benefit touted by the industry is the increased productivity afforded to users of AI PCs compared to those without. While enhancements such as better performance, improved audio-visual experiences and longer battery life are likely to be standard across most AI PCs from different vendors, creating distinct offerings will be crucial. The strategy should be customized to the target audience. For consumers, AI features may focus on personalization and creativity, offering tools like AI assistants for task management or capabilities for generating text and images. Lenovo's proprietary features, such as the Yoga Creator Zone and Xiaotian, are designed to meet these needs. On the other hand, businesses might prioritize features that boost collaboration (for example, real-time translation and meeting summarization), enhance security (for example, AI-powered threat detection) and provide data-driven insights (for example, business intelligence tools). By delivering a tailored suite of AI tools that address specific needs and enhance productivity, PC vendors can secure a more robust position in the market.\n\nProtected experience\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated and widespread, security concerns are intensifying. A recent Canalys survey reveals that 51% of respondents identify confidentiality and data protection as their top concerns regarding AI adoption in the workplace. On-device AI offers a potential solution by improving data security. However, this advantage must be effectively communicated to users. IT decision-makers are now facing the challenge of managing the security landscape as their organizations shift toward AI-enhanced environments. Lenovo can address these concerns by emphasizing features powered by its Neural Processing Unit (NPU), such as real-time threat detection. More importantly, Lenovo can provide significant value through comprehensive end-to-end solutions and consulting services that assist customers in securing their IT infrastructures.\n\nBeyond security concerns for customers, broader challenges persist from regulatory bodies and the readiness of the market for new AI features. For instance, Microsoft has postponed the introduction of its \"Recall\" feature in Copilot+ PCs following increased focus on its \"Secure Future Initiative\". In a rapidly changing environment, PC vendors face the risk of association with broader AI-related concerns and must adopt a proactive approach to ensure the secure and ethical development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\nEffective partnerships will be crucial in driving AI PC adoption\n\nLenovo eyes on-device AI as a tailwind to drive premium market growth, accelerate PC refresh cycles and boost profitability. However, achieving real-world success from this potential will require collaborative efforts across various industry stakeholders.\n\nChannel partners will play a crucial role in the large-scale adoption of AI PCs. According to Canalys polling, channel partners remain cautious about the opportunity, with 41% noting no impact on customers' refresh plans as of May 2024, an increase from the estimated 33% in November 2023. This caution emphasizes an important reality -- the benefits and use cases for AI PCs remain murky to many customers. As a channel-first company, it is incumbent upon Lenovo to educate and equip partners to be strong proponents of AI PCs, especially during the ongoing Windows refresh cycle in which a large proportion of its end customers will be upgrading their PC fleet.\n\nBeyond channel partners, engagement with ISVs and incentivizing developers to explore new use cases that capitalize on SoC advancements will be critical. While NPUs offer performance improvements, the true value lies in software that can unlock their full potential. Initiatives like Lenovo's \"AI Innovators Program\" are a good start, but continued investment in driving on-device AI capabilities, software development and partner education is necessary to create clear benefits for customers when they choose Lenovo as their primary technology provider.\n\nFor more Canalys insights on the emergence of AI-capable PCs, read our in-depth report now.

With SAIC in place, we can develop our local ready AI talents,\" Shawn said at an interactive workshop on AI yesterday.\n\nHe was commenting on the announcement made by Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas on July 2 that State Cabinet recently approved the establishment of SAIC, which will focus on AI research, development, and commercialisation.\n\nUggah, who is also Second Minister of Finance and New Economy, was quoted as saying that SAIC would play a crucial role in accelerating the development of local AI talent and attracting global AI experts, thereby enhancing Sarawak's competitiveness in attracting investments.\n\nMeanwhile, around 100 participants took part in the one-day interactive workshop on \"Leverage the Power of Generative AI with Xentinel AI\" led by Shawn at a leading hotel here yesterday.\n\nThe participants were from various industries, including the education sector and government-linked companies (GLCs).\n\nJointly organised by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) and its local training partner Betapuru Digital Sdn Bhd, the workshop was a part of MDEC's MD Workforce Training programme for this year.\n\nIts aim was to encourage the Malaysian workforce to position themselves for success in the digital tech job market by acquiring highly demanded digital skills.\n\nDuring the workshop, participants were educated about Generative AI and its significance in the modern economy.\n\nThey learnt how to create videos, mobile apps, and websites in mere minutes using Generative AI tools.\n\nAdditionally, they gained hands-on experience with Xentinel AI's features, including Text Generation, Audio Generation, Image Generation, and Dashboard Generation.\n\nXentinel AI enables users to interact with PDFs and datasheets to streamline productivity.\n\nDeveloped by a local Sarawakian company for the global market, Xentinel AI boasts multi-modal productivity tools and is the first of its kind to generate dashboard charts via a command prompt.\n\nShawn highlighted that the advent of Generative AI technology has shifted employment patterns.\n\nHe cited a recent survey by Microsoft and LinkedIn, which revealed that 65 per cent of Malaysian employers now prefer AI-savvy graduates over experienced workers.\n\n\"Generative AI has changed employment patterns, and I foresee it becoming a basic job requirement soon. Programmes like MDEC's MD Workforce Training are crucial for equipping knowledge workers with the latest AI skills through upskilling and reskilling,\" Shawn said.\n\nFurthermore, he explained that Generative AI technology is becoming a general-purpose technology, similar to the steam engine, electricity, and the internet.\n\n\"The opportunities and risks brought forth by AI make it indispensable for continued prosperity. We must adopt AI swiftly rather than considering it a luxury\" he added.\n\nDespite the powerful Generative AI technology, Shawn cautioned participants to always verify AI-generated information and to use AI technology responsibly and ethically.\n\n\"The output is only as good as its training data. If data sources are crawled from all over the internet, the quality may be compromised due to inaccurate content.\n\n\"With every technological revolution, there will always be bad actors who misuse technology. It is crucial to build a community that uses AI responsibly and ethically. This is why AI regulations are necessary, \" he emphasised.", "source": {"uri": "theborneopost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Borneo Post Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Applications_International_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Science Applications International Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarawak", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sarawak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarawak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Uggah_Embas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Uggah Embas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(Malaysia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (Malaysia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_styles_and_titles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malay styles and titles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuching"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuching"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Assistive_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Assistive Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/07/kch-100724-sa-ai-p1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuching"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 16}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 689, "textEnd": 695}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

What if we've overstated its potential to the point of being, frankly, dangerous? That's the concern of NHS cancer experts, who warn that the health service is becoming too obsessed with new technology and putting patient safety at risk. Yesterday's Story:\n\nCancer experts have issued a starkly worded warning, saying \"novel solutions\" such as new diagnostic tests are being falsely touted as \"silver bullets\" to the cancer crisis, but \"nothing addresses the underlying issue of cancer as a systems problem.\"\n\nThe authors add that a \"common misconception\" among NHS leaders is that new technologies can reverse inequalities - when in reality, tools such as AI can create \"additional barriers for those with lower digital and health literacy\".\n\n\"We caution against adopting a technology-centric approach without a robust fairness evaluation,\" the paper concludes.\n\nThe paper, published in the Lancet Oncology, argues for a back-to-basics approach to cancer treatment. Its proposals focus on solutions such as increasing staff numbers, redirecting research into outdated areas like surgery and radiation therapy, and setting up dedicated units for technology transfer so that proven treatments actually become part of routine care.\n\nAI can be an attractive distraction from these badly needed improvements. The promise of this technology is that within a few years, capabilities will improve dramatically, allowing AI techniques to perform health care tasks that cannot be performed today, or at least tasks that require hours of highly trained professionals to perform. But experts fear that promises about the future will distract from changes that are needed today.\n\nIt positions AI as the latest example of \"bionic duckweed.\" A term coined by Stian Westlake in 2020 It covers the intentional or unintentional use of technologies that may or may not come in the future to oppose current investments. Elon Musk's Hyperloop is perhaps the most famous example of a bionic hack, first proposed over a decade ago with the explicit aim of blocking the state of California from going ahead with plans to build a high-speed rail line.\n\n(The phrase comes from a real-life example: in 2007 the UK government was advised to refrain from electrifying its railways because \"in 15 years' time we might have trains running on hydrogen, developed from bionic duckweed... we'd have to remove the electric wires and it would all be for nothing.\" 17 years later, the UK still runs diesel engines on non-electrified routes.)\n\nBut the paper's worry about AI, and about health care's general techno-philia, isn't just that it might never materialize: even if AI does indeed begin to make headway in the fight against cancer, without the right foundations, it might not prove as useful as hoped.\n\nReturning to the article, let's quote lead author, oncologist Ajay Agarwal:\n\nAI is a workflow tool, but does it actually improve survival rates? So far, the evidence is limited. Sure, AI can help the workforce, but people are still needed to take patient histories, draw blood, perform surgery, and deliver bad news.\n\nEven if AI turns out to be as good as we hope it will be, it may not mean much for healthcare in general in the short term. For example, AI may significantly speed up radiologists' work, allowing them to diagnose cancer sooner and more quickly after a scan, but this is useless if there are bottlenecks in the rest of the healthcare service. In a worst-case scenario, the technology-driven parts of the workflow could overwhelm the rest of the system, creating a kind of AI-driven denial-of-service attack.\n\nAI advocates hope that in the long term, the system will adapt and embrace the technology (or, if you're a true believer, that might just mean waiting until AI can staff every nook and cranny of a hospital.) But in the short term, it's important not to assume that just because AI can handle some medical tasks, it will help fix a health care system in distress.\n\nDigital Government\n\nLast week, we explored some ideas for what the new administration could do on technology, and at least one of the proposals looks like it might work. Peter Kyle, the new Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation, has only been in the job for a few days, but it's already in my inbox. Here's what the DSIT will look like, he said:\n\nBecoming the centre of digital expertise and delivery in government; Governments and public services interact with their citizens.\n\nWe act as leaders and partners across government, industry and the research community to improve the UK's economic performance, strengthen public services and improve people's lives and life chances through the application of science and technology.\n\nSpecifically, DSIT will \"support upskilling of civil servants to better harness digital and AI in frontline jobs.\" \"We take AI government seriously\";It appears this is already the case.\n\nLattice plans to have its AI employees go through all the same processes that human employees go through when starting a new role.\n\nAdd them to your employee record, integrate them with your HRIS, add them to your organizational chart so you can see where they fit within their team or department, and onboard your AI employees to ensure they receive the training they need for their role.\n\nAnd we're going to assign these digital workers goals and hold them accountable to certain standards, just like any other employee. This will be a big learning moment for us and for the industry.\n\nHere's Sarah Franklin, CEO of HR platform Lattice, talking about the company's plans to put AI employees through all the same steps as human employees: But if you want a glimpse of what AI success might look like, this isn't too far off in the future.\n\nCompanies are bad at adopting new technology: once something works well enough, they tend to stick with it for years, even decades, and encouraging them to switch to a different way of doing things is a big hurdle, even if the benefits seem great.\n\nBut they're much better at hiring new staff. They have to: staff quit, retire, have kids, pass away. If they could tune their process for hiring AI workers to be more like the latter than the former, they could greatly expand the pool of companies that feel able to bring AI into their world.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bionics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnoideae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lemnoideae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lancet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patient safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiation therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population bottleneck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0347e9ff3d7e0b341fd7553e3688fadd0aaaa557/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bbd4d25879014d2f8d4a18462fdcb85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Today, AI is already automating complex coding tasks-a recent study found that programmers using AI could code 126% more projects per week. This progress has allowed developers to focus on more strategic and innovative roles such as architectural planning, integration, and product management. This shift is not merely a trend but a fundamental change in the way software is developed and deployed.\n\nJust as in programming, there is growing awareness and excitement around generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 80% of adults have heard of generative AI, with 22.5% already using it.\n\nAmong users, 44.8% use it for research, 33.4% for writing assistance, and 24.3% for personal assistants.\n\nI asked Ariel Katz, CEO of Sisense, an AI-powered embedded analytics company that enables developers to program embedded analytics directly into their apps, what he thought about the integration of AI into software development.\n\n\"It's a game-changer,\" said Katz. \"It's not just about automating tasks; it's about enabling developers to think and work at a much higher level and focus on the strategic aspects of their projects.\"\n\nThis shift, Katz explained, is not about replacing human developers but rather enhancing their creativity and efficiency. As AI handles repetitive and time-consuming coding tasks, developers can utilize their unique human skills to drive innovation and lead technological advancements. They are evolving from being mere code creators to becoming visionaries and orchestrators of technology.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs), once viewed as temporary solutions for data sharing between incompatible systems, have evolved into powerful tools that quickly deliver critical information exactly where it's needed. As such, the API economy is growing fast and providing increased insight without the bulk and distraction of more complex software applications. While the API is the conduit for the data, putting that data into a meaningful context is where AI comes in. AI uses reason and analysis to suggest meaningful connections between data points, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other metrics.\n\nUsing APIs, AI not only democratizes business analytics integration for developers who don't have specialized data knowledge but also advocates for a more integrated approach where analytics are built as fundamental components of applications. This shift from traditional business intelligence (BI) to an embedded analytics approach allows developers to create rich data experiences without in-depth knowledge of BI, SQL, or data modeling, thus opening analytics to a wider developer community. The role of AI in making analytics more interactive and user-friendly is crucial. Together, AI and embedded APIs can provide a more natural, integrated work experience.\n\nThis democratization of data is a key benefit of AI in both software development and data analytics. It allows non-technical stakeholders to access and understand complex data, fostering a more collaborative and informed decision-making process. As AI becomes more sophisticated, its impact on software development is expected to grow.\n\n\"The future of software development lies in the seamless integration of human creativity and AI capabilities,\" Katz said. \"Developers who harness the power of AI while bringing their unique problem-solving skills to the table will lead in this new era.\"\n\nSome experts predict that in the future, AI could handle most coding tasks, with developers primarily involved in high-level planning and problem-solving. Others caution that relying too heavily on AI could lead to a loss of fundamental coding skills and a lack of understanding of the underlying technology.\n\n\"While there has been concern about GenAI taking over the role of developers completely, this is very unlikely and the potential benefits of AI in software development are immense,\" said Katz. \"It could lead to faster development cycles, more efficient code, and innovative new software capabilities. For developers, it presents an opportunity to focus on the most engaging and impactful aspects of their work, such as crafting intuitive user experiences and solving complex business problems.\"\n\nThe key to success in this new era of software development will be finding the right balance between human creativity and AI efficiency. The most successful organizations will be those that can effectively blend human expertise with AI-driven insights. It's about leveraging the strengths of both to drive innovation and stay ahead of the curve.\n\nThe integration of AI into software development is not a future prospect-it is a reality today. Developers and tech companies alike must adapt and evolve to fully capitalize on the opportunities AI presents. The role of the software developer is changing, and those who embrace this change will be the pioneers shaping the future of technology.\n\nAs we move forward into this new era, it's important to remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human ingenuity. The most successful developers will be those who can wield this tool effectively, combining their creativity, problem-solving skills, and domain expertise with the power of AI. It's an exciting time to be a software developer, with new challenges and opportunities emerging every day. Those who can adapt and thrive in this new landscape will be the leaders of the digital future.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Performance indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Programmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data modeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SQL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Human-Computer_Interaction/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Human-Computer Interaction/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Software", "label": "dmoz/Science/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Methodologies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Methodologies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/667f165b6763e6b64e15e54e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Everything from entertainment and transportation, to e-commerce and medicine, is being profoundly affected.\n\nThe legal field is no exception, with AI increasingly being employed to enhance efficiency in legal research, document review, billing, and even predictive analyses.\n\nAI in the legal realm is multifaceted, encompassing everything from simple automation tools to complex machine learning algorithms capable of sifting through vast amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes. These technologies can significantly reduce the time lawyers spend on routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more nuanced aspects of legal work.\n\nHowever, the integration of AI into law raises profound ethical considerations that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\n\nThe core ethical concerns revolve around legal responsibility and accountability, accuracy, privacy, and bias and fairness.\n\nUnderstanding AI in the Legal Context\n\nThe ethical implications of AI in law are extensive and complex.\n\nThe American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct provide a foundation for ethical legal practice, and have been adopted in almost every American jurisdiction.\n\nVarious ethical rules are implicated, such as those relating to competence (Rule 1.1), diligence (Rule 1.3), fees (Rule 1.5), confidentiality of information (Rule 1.6), safekeeping of property (Rule 1.15), independent professional judgment as an advisor (Rule 2.1), meritorious claims and contentions (Rule 3.1), truthfulness in statements to others (Rule 4.1), responsibilities as to non-lawyer assistance (Rule 5.3), and the professional independence of lawyers (Rule 5.4).\n\nOf significance, Rule 1.1's \"duty of technology competence\" requires that lawyers \"keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.\"\n\nIn short, lawyers must exercise due diligence in their use of AI, ensuring that it enhances rather than compromises their ability to deliver competent legal services.\n\nMoreover, the implementation of AI in law firms must be guided by a commitment to augmenting the capabilities of legal professionals, not replacing them. Stated differently, AI should serve as a tool that improves the quality and efficiency of legal services and increases affordability and access to justice, all while adhering to the highest ethical standards.\n\nResponsibility and Accountability\n\nLegal responsibility and accountability are paramount. When AI is used in legal decision-making, it raises questions about who is ultimately responsible for those decisions -- the lawyers, the developers of the AI, or the AI itself.\n\nLegal responsibility and accountability take on new dimensions with AI. As AI systems can execute tasks traditionally performed by humans, determining liability when something goes awry is challenging. The legal profession must adapt its frameworks to address the distributed nature of decision-making in AI systems, ensuring that accountability is not lost in the web of automation.\n\nDespite the advancements in AI, the role of the lawyer remains indispensable. As previously noted, lawyers must use AI as a tool to assist their work, not replace it. They must exercise professional judgment, critical thinking, and ethical consideration in every aspect of their practice, including the use of AI.\n\nAccuracy Considerations Are Crucial\n\nAccuracy is a critical issue, and is another cornerstone of legal ethics affected by AI.\n\nNews reports of inaccurate or flawed AI drafting are numerous. Most of the reports deal with litigation debacles. However, for clients seeking legal advice, uncertainty is often contrary to the purpose of the lawyer's retention.\n\nSuch errors, if undiscovered and uncorrected, could lead to miscarriages of justice and improper legal advice.\n\nAI's predictive capabilities hinge on the quality of the algorithms and the data they process. The precision of AI-generated predictions or analyses is only as good as the data and algorithms used. This necessitates rigorous validation to ensure that AI aids rather than hinders the pursuit of justice.\n\nLawyers must not blindly rely on AI outputs but should corroborate them with independent judgment, verification, and expertise.\n\nPrivacy Concerns Should Be Addressed\n\nPrivacy concerns also come to the fore with AI. The legal profession holds client confidentiality in high regard, and AI systems that process sensitive information must be designed to uphold these privacy standards.\n\nPrivacy concerns arise as AI systems often require access to vast amounts of sensitive data. Protecting client confidentiality while leveraging AI technology is a delicate balance that must be maintained.\n\nLawyers must be cognizant of ethical rules on cybersecurity, as well as data protection laws, and ensure that the AI applications they use comply with stringent confidentiality obligations.\n\nBias and Fairness Should Also Be Considered\n\nAnother significant concern for many types of law firms is bias and fairness. AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the underlying data contains biases, the AI's outputs will likely reflect those biases, potentially leading to unfair or unjust legal outcomes.\n\nBias and fairness in AI are critical issues, as algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate existing prejudices present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to skewed outcomes that may affect the fairness of trials and the impartiality of legal decisions.\n\nLawyers must be vigilant in assessing AI tools to determine whether possible inherent biases might affect the efficacy of the AI application at issue, and if so strive to mitigate their impact on legal outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe legal ethics of AI is a dynamic field that requires ongoing attention and adaptation.\n\nThe intersection of artificial intelligence and legal ethics presents a complex tapestry of considerations that are paramount to the integrity of legal practice. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into the legal field, they bring forth a myriad of ethical questions that challenge traditional notions of responsibility, bias, and the very essence of legal judgment.\n\nTo navigate these ethical challenges, the legal profession must develop clear guidelines and standards for AI use.\n\nThis includes ensuring that AI systems are transparent and explainable, allowing lawyers to understand how a particular output was reached.

However, I would argue this is no longer the best AI stock out there. That's because even in a growing industry, there may be a limit to the company's success.\n\nThat's why we are going to focus on another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock instead. One that has proven it never stops innovating.\n\nAmong the AI stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands out as a top choice for several reasons. Microsoft's AI initiatives, including its partnership with OpenAI and the development of AI products like Microsoft Copilot, position it as a leader in AI transformation across various industries. Furthermore, Microsoft's Azure is one of the top cloud infrastructure services, critical for AI applications. The company's investment in AI-driven cloud services enhances its competitive edge.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft has made a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI to accelerate AI breakthroughs. This partnership includes developing and deploying advanced AI technologies on Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, which serves as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. This collaboration enables both companies to independently commercialize AI advancements and offers new AI-powered experiences across Microsoft's products.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Microsoft stock has made key advancements through strategic investments. Microsoft announced a US$2.9 billion investment to enhance its AI and cloud infrastructure in Japan. This includes training three million people in AI skills over three years, establishing a Microsoft Research Asia lab in Tokyo, and collaborating with the Japanese government on cybersecurity initiatives.\n\nMicrosoft is also investing US$1.7 billion in Indonesia to expand AI and cloud services, aiming to equip 2.5 million people in the ASEAN region with AI skills by 2025. This includes establishing data centres and offering AI skilling programs.\n\nMicrosoft plans to establish a new data centre region in Thailand and provide AI training for over 100,000 people as well. This investment supports Thailand's digital economy and aims to enhance AI skills in the tourism sector. And finally, a US$2.2 billion investment in Malaysia focuses on AI and cloud transformation, including skilling 200,000 people, establishing a national AI Centre of Excellence, and enhancing cybersecurity capabilities in partnership with the Malaysian government.\n\nGiven all this and the company's continued leadership role, Microsoft stock continues to gain confidence from analysts. Analysts highlight Microsoft's extensive AI integration across its products and services. This includes significant enhancements to Microsoft Copilot, AI-first hardware innovations, and the development of cost-effective AI solutions.\n\nAnalysts from Goldman Sachs and Wedbush emphasize the substantial revenue opportunities stemming from Microsoft's AI initiatives. The expanded Microsoft 365 Copilot market, for example, is projected to add significant long-term value. Goldman Sachs estimates the total addressable market (TAM) for Microsoft 365 Copilot at $135 billion, with potential revenue recognition of 15 to 30% by FY26.\n\nMicrosoft now enjoys a consensus \"Buy\" rating from the majority of analysts. The average 12-month price target for the stock is around US$467.12, with some targets going as high as US$600. This reflects a strong belief in the company's ability to capitalize on its AI and cloud capabilities.\n\nAll in all, Microsoft stock continues to climb for good reason. Microsoft's robust AI strategy, strong market position, and positive analyst outlook make it a compelling AI stock to consider.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_legate_wolfe@fool.ca", "name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365_Copilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365 Copilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1204583606-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The event was an important step to implement the Global Initiative for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThemed \"Governing AI for Good and for All,\" the conference embodied the fundamental principles of the initiative and reflected the common aspirations of the international community.\n\nIn October 2023, at the Opening Ceremony of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China will put forward the Global Initiative for AI Governance, which presents a constructive approach to addressing universal concerns over AI development and governance and offers Chinese solutions to relevant international discussions and rule-making.\n\nThe initiative has provided fundamental guidance for China to participate in global AI governance and serves as an important public good that China offers the world. China has been actively implementing the initiative and deeply engaging in global AI governance, which has been widely endorsed and appreciated by the international community.\n\nThe 2024 WAIC has established a crucial platform for international AI exchanges and cooperation.\n\nFollowing the principles of openness, inclusiveness, and equal participation, the conference has brought together representatives from different countries and sectors to advance AI development, security, and governance. It aims to develop an open, fair, and effective governance mechanism and ensure that the innovative achievements of AI truly benefit humanity.\n\nThe conference included an opening ceremony, which is also the plenary session, three main forums on global governance, industrial development, and scientific frontier, and 10 themed forums and several industry forums covering key topics such as AI governance, large models, embodied intelligence, investment and financing, education, and talent development. It also included AI exhibitions, awards ceremonies, competitions, and intelligent experience.\n\nThe conference has brought together over 1,000 leading figures worldwide. More than 200,000 government officials, and representatives of international organizations, industries, universities and research institutes, among others, have attended the conference and shared their profound insights and perspectives into global AI governance, development and practical cooperation. Together, they have built a broad consensus through mutual learning.\n\nChina's active participation and significant leadership in global AI governance demonstrate its role as a responsible major country.\n\nOn July 1, the 78th UN General Assembly recently adopted a China-led resolution on enhancing international AI cooperation, with over 140 countries supporting it. This resolution, as the UN's first on international cooperation for AI capacity building, fully embodies the core principles of the Global Initiative for AI Governance and the Global Development Initiative. It aligns with the high expectations of numerous UN member states, particularly developing countries, and represents broad and robust support for multilateralism and the UN.\n\nThe resolution plays an important role in promoting inclusive AI development around the world, and has won wide support and high evaluation from the international community, especially the Global South. It marks another significant step in practicing the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind on the UN platform.\n\nThe unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects a widespread agreement among UN member states on the necessity of enhancing global AI governance through dialogue and cooperation. It also demonstrates China's responsible approach and significant leadership in AI development and governance. It has proved that building \"small yard, high fence\" and exclusive blocs in AI development and governance is not in line with the trend of the times or the interests of all parties.\n\nThe technological revolution and industrial transformation driven by AI are nurturing tremendous new opportunities, and will undoubtedly bring more confidence and hope to the world.\n\nChina will continue to advance the great cause of building a community with a shared future for mankind and fully demonstrate its sense of duty as a responsible major country. Taking the 2024 WAIC as an opportunity, China will continue to follow the principles of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, actively participate in and lead global AI governance, and work together with all parties to promote the healthy, safe, fair, and orderly development of AI worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "lapost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "lapost.us"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Forum_for_International_Cooperation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global North and Global South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capacity building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "dateEnd": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 120}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2710, "textEnd": 2716}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

On May 17, 2024, Colorado became the latest state to join this movement with the signature by Governor Jared S. Polis of Senate Bill 24-205 (the \"Colorado AI Act\" or the \"Act\"). The Colorado AI Act represents the latest addition to a series of AI regulations proposed by U.S. jurisdictions, with notable regulations adopted by the City of New York and the State of Utah aiming to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence systems (\"AI Systems\").[1]\n\nAs we will discuss in this blog, the Colorado AI Act is relevant for Canadian businesses, even ones with no activities in the State of Colorado as it highlights several key trends in the regulation of AI and can provide guidance for businesses that wish to implement responsible AI practices while the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (the \"AIDA\") continues to move through the federal parliament.\n\nWe discuss here the most important provisions of the Colorado AI Act, and provide a high level comparative analysis with Canadian and European Union (\"EU\") law.\n\nThe preamble of the Colorado AI Act clearly states its intention to promote \"consumer protections in interactions with artificial intelligence systems\". Like the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (the \"EU AI Act\") and AIDA, however, it does not regulate all AI Systems but only those considered \"high-risk\". For the Colorado AI Act, those are systems that, when deployed, can make, or be a \"substantial factor in making\", a \"consequential decision\".[2]\n\nA consequential decision is any decision \"that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on the provision or denial to any consumer of, or the cost or terms of\" specific types of services:\n\nThe Colorado AI Act, although ostensibly a consumer protection law, thus adopts a broad definition of what constitutes a consumer and would notably apply to certain AI-enhanced HR decisions making systems and systems used to provide (essential) public services (a notable difference with the AIDA, which expressly does not apply to the public sector).[3] As such, the Colorado AI Act in part overlaps with the Colorado Privacy Act and its provisions on automated-decision making systems (\"ADM Systems\"). However, the Colorado AI Act has a larger reach because the Colorado Privacy Act only regulates \"profiling\", defined as the automated processing of personal data to evaluate, analyze or predict an individual's preferences or behavior. The new AI legislation rather focuses on the effect of a decision on consumers, regardless of whether it involves the processing of personal data.\n\nSeveral exclusions however limit this seemingly broad scope. The Act does not apply to AI systems that are intended to perform narrow procedural tasks or detect decision-making patterns. Unless those make (or are a substantial factor in making) a consequential decision, the Act also does not consider to be high-risk technologies such as anti-fraud systems (but only if they do not use facial recognition technology), anti-virus, AI-enabled video games, databases, spell-checking, cybersecurity and data storage.\n\nInterestingly, unlike its European and Canadian counterparts, the Colorado AI Act does not include a sui generis category for general-purpose AI systems such as the AI-enhanced chatbots popularized with the release of ChatGPT. On the contrary, the Colorado AI Act presumes that systems using natural language to communicate with consumers are not high-risk if: (1) the purpose is to provide information, make referrals or recommendations; and (2) the system is subject to a use policy prohibiting the generation of discriminatory or harmful content. However, such AI systems may still be considered high risk in certain circumstances, for instance if used to make (or is a \"substantial factor\" in making) a \"consequential decisions\".[4] Substantial factors notably include AI-generated content, decisions, predictions or recommendations \"used as a basis to make a consequential decision\" about a consumer.[5] For example, this might include the use of an AI chatbot to assist in an hiring decision, where the chatbot is asked to review a number of CVs and provide recommendations that are then acted upon uncritically. As such, although the Colorado AI Act is ostensibly about ADM Systems, it could apply to certain uses of generative AI in unexpected ways.\n\nRegulated Roles in the AI Value Chains\n\nMost current AI regulatory frameworks apply varying compliance obligations depending on the role a regulated enterprise plays in the AI value chain. For example, the EU AI Act includes specific obligations for \"providers\", \"deployers\", \"importers\", \"distributors\" and \"operators\" of AI Systems. For its part, the AIDA uses more convoluted, but related terminology of \"person making available for the first time\", \"person making available\" or \"person managing the operations\" of AI Systems. The Colorado AI Act adopts a binary approach which divides the AI value chain between \"deployers\" (persons using high-risk AI systems) and \"developers\" (persons doing business in Colorado and who develop or substantially modify AI Systems).[6] As we will discuss in Section 2 below, the Colorado AI Act imposes different obligations on developers and deployers of AI Systems.\n\nRequirements\n\nBoth developers and deployers of high-risk AI Systems must exercise reasonable care to protect consumers against known or foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination that arise from the intended use of the system. Algorithmic discrimination encompasses situations where the use of an AI system results in unlawful differential treatments or negative consequences based on protected characteristics such as age, color, disability, ethnicity, race and religion. This notion is similar to the concept of \"biased output\" found in the current draft of AIDA.[7]\n\nHowever, developers and deployers benefit from a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care in the event of an action brought against them if they can demonstrate that they have complied with the obligations of the Act. They can also invoke several active affirmative defenses against claims brought by the Attorney General (see Section 4 below), such as the discovery and cure of a violation following adversarial testing or red teaming of the system while maintaining compliance with relevant AI standards.[8]\n\nCompliance requirements vary for each role and will begin to apply on February 1, 2026:\n\nIn addition, one obligation of the deployers of high-risk AI Systems is to inform customers of their right to opt-out of the processing of their personal data for purposes of profiling, as provided in the Colorado Privacy Act. [23] Consequently, the Colorado AI Act does not include a separate right to opt-out of consequential decision by AI Systems that do not process personal data. However, if a high-risk AI System is involved in a consequential decision that is adverse to a consumer, the deployer must provide a statement disclosing the principal reasons for the decision, an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data involved and to appeal the decision, including with human review of the decision (but only if feasible).[24] This is reminiscent of section 12.1 of the Quebec Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector (the \"Quebec Privacy Act\") which provides that businesses making decisions based exclusively on automated processing of personal information must inform the concerned individual of the information used in the decision as well as the reasons and principal factors that led to the outcome. Individuals in Quebec also have a right to have the personal information used in the decision corrected. Section 12.1 of the Quebec Privacy Act does not however include a minimal risk threshold and has in that sense a broader scope than the Colorado AI Act. This is mitigated by the fact that, like the Colorado Privacy Act, the Quebec Privacy is only concerned by systems that process personal information. Moreover, it applies only to decisions made \"exclusively\" through automated processing. The Colorado AI Act is on this dimension broader: high-risk AI Systems include those that play a substantial part in the decisional outcomes, without necessarily being their only factor.\n\nFinally, the Colorado AI Act, similarly to the EU AI Act[25] and proposed amendments to AIDA[26], includes an obligation that apply to the deployment of any AI System (regardless of risk), if it is intended to interact directly with consumers. In those cases, the consumer must be informed that it is interacting with an AI System, unless it would be obvious for the consumer that he or she is interacting with an AI System.[27]\n\nDevelopers and deployers thus need to implement complex and potentially costly compliance programs to meet the obligations of the Act. The Colorado legislature has been mindful that some businesses deploying AI systems, especially small companies and start-ups, may have limited resources for AI compliance and has consequently exempted corporations that employ less than fifty full-time equivalent employees from complying with the obligations related to: (1) implementing of a reasonable risk management policy and program; (2) conducting an annual impact assessment of the high-high AI System or within 90 days of an intentional or substantial modification; and (3) disclosing any instances of algorithmic discrimination to the Attorney General within 90 days of discovery, all as described above, to the extent however they do not use their own data to train an high-risk AI System and the systems are used for their intended purpose.[28]\n\nEnforcement\n\nThe Colorado AI Act falls under the exclusive authority of the Attorney General of Colorado, who is expressly empowered to establish rules for enforcing its requirements.[29] Whereas both the EU AI Act and AIDA incorporate substantial, multi-million dollars or euros fines within their sanction frameworks, the Colorado AI Act takes a different route. A violation of the Colorado AI Act is considered an unfair trade practice, which is sanctionable by fines of up to $USD 20,000 per violation.[30]\n\nFurthermore, the Colorado AI Act does not provide consumers with a private right of action for non-compliance, instead granting such authority solely to the Attorney General. This aligns with AIDA and the EU AI Act, which also lack an explicit private right of action provision. However, this differs notably from the prevailing trend in privacy legislation, exemplified by the Quebec Privacy Act and Canada's newly introduced Consumer Privacy Protection Act (the \"CPPA\"), both of which incorporate a private right of action. Please refer to our blog posts Law 25 and CPPA for more information.\n\nConclusion\n\nCanadian business that wish to export and use AI Systems in Colorado should pay close attention to this AI legislation. Even those that do not would benefit from a general understanding of law that may serve as inspiration for other States (some of which are already studying AI bills[31]). For those considering implementing a responsible AI governance program, the Colorado AI Act also offers valuable indications about the emerging best practice that, little by little, are finding their way into law.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score":

The human applicant, the scientist who owns DABUS - was listed as the inventor, but the application made clear the product was conceived by the AI.\n\nRyan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at Surrey University, and one member of the Artificial Inventor project, said in a statement, the ruling \"confirmed that an AI generated invention is protectable and that a natural person can be named as an inventor, even if AI has been used to generate the invention.\"\n\nSoftware code is generally covered by copyright law effectively as a literary work rather than patent law.\n\nYet speaking to DevClass, Prof Abbott said: \"One of the questions around the world is, can you copyright AI generated output? And in the UK, the answer is yes. And in the US, the answer is no.\"\n\nAs for Europe, he continued, \"The consensus seems to be probably not traditionally, with copyright law.\"\n\nBut, he added that AI can be used to develop AI architectures. \"If you're having AI develop new AI systems, this makes those systems potentially patentable in Germany and not in the UK.\" And this might be \"instructive for the copyright question.\"\n\nAbbott said the US had already held that AI outputs are not patentable. \"But I think Congress is now concerned about that holding and is looking at changing the law because they don't want to fall behind in AI development.\" Developments like those in Germany could prompt the US to move more quickly to reset its position, he said.\n\nWhile the German case focused on a lunchbox, there were far bigger things at stake, he said. One issue was to ensure transparency about exactly how an invention was produced, and to establish that AI generated output was protectable.\n\n\"You want people using AI to make new drugs or optimize industrial components, because we get useful stuff from that. It's really not about motivating individuals in their basement, it's about motivating, economic enterprises, and having people making use of AI.\"\n\nThe German ruling might bring some clarity about AI output, but it doesn't resolve ongoing issues about AI inputs.\n\nA US court last week largely rejected claims by developers that GitHub Copilot was unlawfully copying their code, and in effect, providing it for use by other programmers.\n\nRichard Hynes, cofounder of transformation software vendor ManagementStudio, said, \"I think that ChatGTP / AI is the greatest copyright and IP theft the world has ever seen and that the next few years of AI will be dominated by lawsuits establishing if how OpenAI and others acquired their training data was illegal (it absolutely was).\"", "source": {"uri": "devclass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DEVCLASS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_kunert@devclass.com", "name": "Paul Kunert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DABUS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DABUS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro bono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patentability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Surrey", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Surrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Programmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "http://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ai_shutterstock.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That's good. Even if the productivity gains are smaller than many think, 15% to 20% is significant. Making it easier to learn programming and begin a productive career is nothing to complain about, either. We were all impressed when Simon Willison asked ChatGPT to help him learn Rust. Having that power at your fingertips is amazing.\n\nBut there's one misgiving that I share with a surprisingly large number of other software developers. Does the use of generative AI increase the gap between entry-level junior developers and senior developers?\n\nGenerative AI makes a lot of things easier. When writing Python, I often forget to put colons where they need to be. I frequently forget to use parentheses when I call , even though I never used Python 2. (Very old habits die very hard and there are many older languages in which print is a command rather than a function call.) I usually have to look up the name of the Pandas function to do, well, just about anything -- even though I use Pandas fairly heavily. Generative AI, whether you use GitHub Copilot, Gemini, or something else eliminates that problem. And I've written that, for the beginner, generative AI saves a lot of time, frustration, and mental space by reducing the need to memorize library functions and arcane details of language syntax -- which are multiplying as every language feels the need to catch up to its competition. (The walrus operator? Give me a break.)\n\nThere's another side to that story, though. We're all lazy and we don't like to remember the names and signatures of all the functions in the libraries that we use. But is not needing to know them a good thing? There is such a thing as fluency with a programming language, just as there is with human language. You don't become fluent by using a phrasebook. That might get you through a summer backpacking through Europe, but if you want to get a job there, you'll need to do a lot better. The same thing is true in almost any discipline. I have a PhD in English literature. I know that Wordsworth was born in 1770, the same year as Beethoven; Coleridge was born in 1772; a lot of important texts in Germany and England were published in 1798 (plus or minus a few years); the French revolution was in 1789 -- does that mean something important was happening? Something that goes beyond Wordsworth and Coleridge writing a few poems and Beethoven writing a few symphonies? As it happens, it does. But how would someone who wasn't familiar with these basic facts think to prompt an AI about what was going on when all these separate events collided? Would you think to ask about the connection between Wordsworth, Coleridge, and German thought, or to formulate ideas about the Romantic movement that transcended individuals and even European countries? Or would we be stuck with islands of knowledge that aren't connected, because we (not the AIs) are the ones that connect them? The problem isn't that an AI couldn't make the connection, it's that we wouldn't think to ask it to make the connection.\n\nI see the same problem in programming. If you want to write a program, you have to know what you want to do. But you also need an idea of how it can be done if you want to get a nontrivial result from an AI. You have to know what to ask and, to a surprising extent, how to ask it. I experienced this just the other day. I was doing some simple data analysis with Python and Pandas. I was going line by line with a language model, asking \"How do I\" for each line of code that I needed (sort of like GitHub Copilot) -- partly as an experiment, partly because I don't use Pandas often enough. And the model backed me into a corner that I had to hack myself out of. How did I get into that corner? Not because of the quality of the answers. Every response to every one of my prompts was correct. In my post-mortem, I checked the documentation and tested the sample code that the model provided. I got backed into the corner because of the one question I didn't know that I needed to ask. I went to another language model, composed a longer prompt that described the entire problem I wanted to solve, compared this answer to my ungainly hack, and then asked \"What does the method do?\" And then I felt (not incorrectly) like a clueless beginner -- if I had known to ask my first model to reset the index, I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nYou could, I suppose, read this example as \"see, you really don't need to know all the details of Pandas, you just have to write better prompts and ask the AI to solve the whole problem.\" Fair enough. But I think the real lesson is that you do need to be fluent in the details. Whether you let a language model write your code in large chunks or one line at a time, if you don't know what you're doing, either approach will get you in trouble sooner rather than later. You perhaps don't need to know the details of Pandas' function, but you do need to know that it's there. And you need to know that is there. I have had to ask GPT \"wouldn't this work better if you used ?\" because I've asked it to write a program where was the obvious solution, and it didn't. You may need to know whether your model has used correctly. Testing and debugging haven't, and won't, go away.\n\nWhy is this important? Let's not think about the distant future, when programming-as-such may no longer be needed. We need to ask how junior programmers entering the field now will become senior programmers if they become over-reliant on tools like Copilot and ChatGPT. Not that they shouldn't use these tools -- programmers have always built better tools for themselves, generative AI is the latest generation in tooling, and one aspect of fluency has always been knowing how to use tools to become more productive. But unlike earlier generations of tools, generative AI easily becomes a crutch; it could prevent learning, rather than facilitate it. And junior programmers who never become fluent, who always need a phrasebook, will have trouble making the jump to seniors.\n\nAnd that's a problem. I've said, many of us have said, that people who learn how to use AI won't have to worry about losing their jobs to AI. But there's another side to that: People who learn how to use AI to the exclusion of becoming fluent in what they're doing with the AI will also need to worry about losing their jobs to AI. They will be replaceable -- literally, because they won't be able to do anything an AI can't do. They won't be able to come up with good prompts because they will have trouble imagining what's possible. They'll have trouble figuring out how to test and they'll have trouble debugging when AI fails. What do you need to learn? That's a hard question, and my thoughts about fluency may not be correct. But I would be willing to bet that people who are fluent in the languages and tools they use will use AI more productively than people who aren't. I would also bet that learning to look at the big picture rather than the tiny slice of code you're working on will take you far. Finally, the ability to connect the big picture with the microcosm of minute details is a skill that few people have. I don't. And, if it's any comfort, I don't think AIs do, either.\n\nSo -- learn to use AI. Learn to write good prompts. The ability to use AI has become \"table stakes\" for getting a job, and rightly so. But don't stop there. Don't let AI limit what you learn and don't fall into the trap of thinking that \"AI knows this, so I don't have to.\" AI can help you become fluent: the answer to \"What does do\" was revealing, even if having to ask was humbling. It's certainly something I'm not likely to forget. Learn to ask the big picture questions: What's the context into which this piece of code fits?

The Future Of Data-Driven Decisions", "body": "Ashok Reddy is CEO of KX, the creator of kdb+, a time series database and real-time analytics engine.\n\nPicture this: The year is 2030, and you're living in a world where retailers can predict consumer behavior with uncanny accuracy, healthcare providers are diagnosing diseases before symptoms escalate and financial institutions can detect fraud in time. You may think this is the opening scene of the next greatest science-fiction movie, but it's not -- it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) databases at work!\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to advance, its integration into various sectors has sparked significant debate. Many worry that AI is poised to replace human jobs, leading to widespread unemployment and economic disruption, but some business leaders argue that this technology is creating more jobs than it has displaced. New roles have emerged, such as deep learning engineers, AI chatbot developers, Chief AI Officers (CAIO) and even \"AI ethicists,\" whose job is to maintain a responsible AI framework.\n\nDespite these differing perspectives, one fact remains clear: AI databases were designed to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. While these systems aim to replicate human thinking, they can't replace humans entirely because they're incapable of providing causal context -- the \"why\" behind their conclusions. Instead, AI databases enhance or supplement human capabilities and decision making processes, democratizing access to information and empowering individuals at all levels to make informed choices.\n\nAt its core, an AI database is a powerful fusion of AI technologies within a traditional database system designed to provide value-added services. These databases are specifically targeted at optimizing computing and database resources, allowing for the simultaneous ingestion, exploration, analysis and visualization of fast-moving, complex data in milliseconds. This enables them to perform tasks that traditionally require significant human effort and time, such as pattern recognition and predictive analytics. By automating data analysis and providing actionable insights, AI databases free up human resources to focus on higher-order thinking and strategic planning. This not only enhances efficiency but also drives innovation, as employees can dedicate more time to developing creative solutions and exploring new opportunities.\n\nDespite these compelling benefits, some individuals and organizations have voiced hesitancy to fully embrace AI databases, given that the technology is still in relatively uncharted territory. One major concern among prospective users is data privacy and security. The vast amounts of data processed by these databases raise significant concerns about how this information is protected and whether the database complies with regulatory requirements. Additionally, ethical considerations are paramount; ensuring that AI databases operate without biases and that decision making processes are transparent and fair is crucial. Continuous monitoring, regular updates and retraining models to ensure they remain accurate and up to date can help address these concerns, ensuring the system remains accountable.\n\nAI databases are augmenting the work of data scientists and developers by democratizing the decision making process and empowering individuals across all departments and seniority with the necessary context to make informed decisions. Armed with these abilities, they're able to better support their organization's broader goals faster and with more confidence, ultimately contributing to a more agile and informed decision making environment.\n\nAdditionally, AI databases can lower the cost of cognition, reducing the mental effort required to process information and make decisions. This reduction in cognitive load enables employees to focus on higher-order thinking, such as strategic planning and creative problem-solving. As a result, organizations can respond more swiftly to market changes, identify new opportunities and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nA practical example of AI databases enhancing decision making is their ability to predict trends across various industries.\n\n* In finance, AI-powered databases analyze market data and consumer behavior to forecast investment opportunities, allowing financial institutions to manage risks and optimize strategies.\n\n* In healthcare, they can predict disease outbreaks and treatment outcomes, enabling better resource allocation and patient care.\n\n* In retail, AI databases forecast demand and optimize inventory management, reducing waste and improving profitability.\n\nOrganizations can make proactive decisions and drive company growth by leveraging these predictive capabilities.\n\nOrganizations should adopt strategic approaches tailored to their specific needs and goals to fully harness the power of AI databases. Here are key strategies to consider.\n\n* Identify Applications Requiring Faster Data Processing: Evaluate and prioritize applications that benefit most from rapid data ingestion and processing. This could include alerting to nefarious behaviors indicative of fraud or pricing and claims forecasting.\n\n* Align AI Databases with Organizational AI Goals: Ensure that the deployment of AI databases aligns with your organization's broader AI strategy. This involves integrating AI databases into existing workflows and systems to support machine learning and deep learning initiatives effectively.\n\n* Build Efficient Model Pipeline Platforms: Develop robust model pipeline platforms to streamline the creation, training and deployment of machine learning models. These platforms should facilitate the seamless integration of data from AI databases, enabling data scientists and analysts to build and iterate models quickly.\n\n* Address Data Governance And Management Challenges Early On: Proactively tackle data governance and management issues to avoid potential pitfalls. Establish clear policies for data privacy, security and compliance with regulatory requirements. Implement processes for data quality assurance and ethical AI practices to ensure the integrity and fairness of AI-driven decisions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, organizations can maximize the benefits of their AI databases, driving efficiency, innovation and competitive advantage across their operations.\n\nAs we move into an increasingly data-driven future, the role of AI databases will only continue to grow in importance. From predicting consumer behavior to revolutionizing healthcare and financial markets, these tools are reshaping industries and empowering decision-makers at every level. Yet, as with any innovation, success lies in adoption and strategic implementation.\n\nJust as the scenario painted in the opening scene of this article hinted at a world of endless possibilities, the potential of AI databases offers a future where data-driven insights propel us into unimaginable territories of discovery and success.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Li made his position known at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai with attendance from several leading AI companies and countries.\n\nThe Chinese premier noted that an even approach to AI innovation will be key in bridging the \"intelligence gap\" between developed and developing countries. Describing AI as the \"commonwealth of mankind,\" Qiang noted that nearly half of the global population does not have access to AI offerings despite the seemingly rapid pace of adoption.\n\nHe disclosed that proceeding in a uniform manner for technology innovation and adoption is the Chinese habit of doing things, hinting at the leaps recorded in 5G technology, navigation systems, and COVID-19 medical technologies.\n\nApart from the lofty goal of providing 2.5 billion persons with access to large language models (LLMs), the Chinese premier pointed out that China is keen on ensuring responsible development for the technology. In his keynote address, Qiang highlighted the risks stemming from uneven regulatory standards, a trend that could fuel regulatory arbitrage from service providers.\n\n\"Developing artificial intelligence is like setting sail on a vast ocean,\" said Qiang. \"The scenery ahead is exciting, but there will inevitably be storms along the way. As long as we firmly grasp the correct course, work together, and help each other, we will surely reach a better place.\"\n\nLast week, a Chinese-backed AI resolution received mass support from the United Nations member states, seeking to democratize AI development among nations and present a united front in facing looming AI challenges.\n\n\"The unanimous adoption of the resolution indicates broad agreement among member states to enhance global AI governance through dialogue and cooperation, fully demonstrating China's responsible attitude and leading role in AI development and governance,\" added Qiang.\n\nGoing head-to-head against US\n\nChina and the United States have separated themselves from the rest of the pack, but rather than favoring industry collaboration, experts are highlighting a brewing cold war between both nations.\n\nFor starters, analysts point to the existing trade restrictions by the U.S. against China for high-end AI chips, with Washington citing security concerns as a key reason for the embargo. China, keen to forge its own path, has geo-restricted several AI offerings from the U.S. while rolling out its solutions for global AI regulations.\n\nChinese authorities are racing against the clock to prevent falling behind the U.S. in AI innovation, a fate that befell the Asian country with other emerging technologies. By hosting the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, pundits say China may have earned some points against its Western rival.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Take our quick AI survey and share your insights on the current state of AI, how you're implementing it, and what you expect to see in the future. Learn More\n\nLess than two years after the release of ChatGPT, enterprises are showing keen interest in using generative AI in their operations and products. A new survey conducted by Dataiku and Cognizant, polling 200 senior analytics and IT leaders at enterprise companies globally, reveals that most organizations are spending hefty amounts to either explore generative AI use cases or have already implemented them in production.\n\nHowever, the path to full adoption and productivity is not without its hurdles, and these challenges provide opportunities for companies that provide generative AI services.\n\nSignificant investments in generative AI\n\nThe survey results announced at VB Transform today highlight substantial financial commitments to generative AI initiatives. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of respondents plan to spend more than $500,000 on generative AI in the next 12 months, with almost half (46%) allocating more than $1 million.\n\nHowever, only one-third of the surveyed organizations have a specific budget dedicated to generative AI initiatives. More than half are funding their generative AI projects from other sources, including IT, data science or analytics budgets.\n\nIt is not clear how pouring money into generative AI is affecting departments that could have otherwise benefitted from the budget, and the return on investment (ROI) for these expenditures remains unclear. But there's optimism that the added value will eventually justify the costs as there seems to be no slowing in the advances of large language models (LLMs) and other generative models.\n\n\"As more LLM use cases and applications emerge across the enterprise, IT teams need a way to easily monitor both performance and cost to get the most out of their investments and identify problematic usage patterns before they have a huge impact on the bottom line,\" the study reads in part.\n\nA previous survey by Dataiku shows that enterprises are exploring all kinds of applications, ranging from enhancing customer experience to improving internal operations such as software development and data analytics.\n\nPersistent challenges in implementing generative AI\n\nDespite the enthusiasm around generative AI, integration is easier said than done. Most of the respondents in the survey reported having infrastructure barriers in using LLMs in the way that they would like. On top of that, they face other challenges, including regulatory compliance with regional legislation such as the EU AI Act and internal policy challenges.\n\nOperational costs of generative models also remain a barrier. Hosted LLM services such as Microsoft Azure ML, Amazon Bedrock and OpenAI API remain popular choices for exploring and producing generative AI within organizations. These services are easy to use and abstract away the technical difficulties of setting up GPU clusters and inference engines. However, their token-based pricing model also makes it difficult for CIOs to manage the costs of generative AI projects at scale.\n\nAlternatively, organizations can use self-hosted open-source LLMs, which can meet the needs of enterprise applications and significantly cut inference costs. But they require upfront spending and in-house technical talent that many organizations don't have.\n\nTech stack complications further hinder generative AI adoption. A staggering 60% of respondents reported using more than five tools or pieces of software for each step in the analytics and AI lifecycle, from data ingestion to MLOps and LLMOps.\n\nData challenges\n\nThe advent of generative AI hasn't eliminated pre-existing data challenges in machine learning projects. In fact, data quality and usability remain the biggest data infrastructure challenges faced by IT leaders, with 45% citing it as their main concern. This is followed by data access issues, mentioned by 27% of respondents.\n\nMost organizations are sitting on a rich pile of data, but their data infrastructure was created before the age of generative AI and without taking machine learning into account. The data often exists in different silos and is stored in different formats that are incompatible with each other. It needs to be preprocessed, cleaned, anonymized, and consolidated before it can be used for machine learning purposes. Data engineering and data ownership management continue to remain important challenges for most machine learning and AI projects.\n\n\"Even with all of the tools organizations have at their disposal today, people still have not mastered data quality (as well as usability, meaning is it fit for purpose and does it suit the users' needs?),\" the study reads. \"It's almost ironic that the biggest modern data stack challenge is ... actually not very modern at all.\"\n\nOpportunities amid challenges\n\n\"The reality is that generative AI will continue to shift and evolve, with different technologies and providers coming and going. How can IT leaders get in the game while also staying agile to what's next?\" said Conor Jensen, Field CDO of Dataiku. \"All eyes are on whether this challenge -- in addition to spiraling costs and other risks -- will eclipse the value production of generative AI.\"\n\nAs generative AI continues to transition from exploratory projects to the technology underlying scalable operations, companies that provide generative AI services can support enterprises and developers with better tools and platforms.\n\nAs the technology matures, there will be plenty of opportunities to simplify the tech and data stacks for generative AI projects to reduce the complexity of integration and help developers focus on solving problems and delivering value.\n\nEnterprises can also prepare themselves for the wave of generative AI technologies even if they are not exploring the technology yet. By running small pilot projects and experimenting with new technologies, organizations can find pain points in their data infrastructure and policies and start preparing for the future. At the same time, they can start building in-house skills to make sure they have more options and be better positioned to harness the technology's full potential and drive innovation in their respective industries.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_dickson@venturebeat.com", "name": "Ben Dickson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataiku", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dataiku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual Basic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enterprise-data.jpg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The AI boom will boost the economy, the AI bubble is about to burst. AI will increase abundance and empower humanity to maximally flourish in the universe. AI will kill us all.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the hottest technology of our time. But what is it? It sounds like a stupid question, but it's one that's never been more urgent. Here's the short answer: AI is a catchall term for a set of technologies that make computers do things that are thought to require intelligence when done by people. Think of recognizing faces, understanding speech, driving cars, writing sentences, answering questions, creating pictures. But even that definition contains multitudes.\n\nAnd that right there is the problem. What does it mean for machines to understand speech or write a sentence? What kinds of tasks could we ask such machines to do? And how much should we trust the machines to do them?\n\nBack in 2022, partway through the first episode of Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000, a party-pooping podcast in which the irascible cohosts Alex Hanna and Emily Bender have a lot of fun sticking \"the sharpest needles'' into some of Silicon Valley's most inflated sacred cows, they make a ridiculous suggestion. They're hate-reading aloud from a 12,500-word Medium post by a Google VP of engineering, Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas, titled \"Can machines learn how to behave?\" Ag\u00fcera y Arcas makes a case that AI can understand concepts in a way that's somehow analogous to the way humans understand concepts -- concepts such as moral values. In short, perhaps machines can be taught to behave.\n\nHanna and Bender are having none of it. They decide to replace the term \"AI'' with \"mathy math\" -- you know, just lots and lots of math.\n\nThe irreverent phrase is meant to collapse what they see as bombast and anthropomorphism in the sentences being quoted.

That same speed of adoption, however, begs the question of whether today's AI has incorporated adequate security.\n\nThere is substance behind that question - which is why in 2023 the industry analyst group Gartner placed a number of AI technologies in its Hype Cycle report, with generative AI at the top of its Peak of Inflated Expectations.\n\nThis dubious distinction should not be surprising to any of us. You can't read or watch the news without the topic of AI coming up as one of the greatest innovations for human achievement in modern memory. And yet, for the very reason that AI has the potential to do great things, it is also one of the most significant potential causes for harm if used for malicious purposes. We must be clear that with the advent of AI, demands on security have never been greater than they are at this moment.\n\nIt is the potential threat to security posed by AI that prompted the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus this past May to introduce the Secure Artificial Intelligence Act of 2024. The legislation is intended to \"improve information sharing between the federal government and private companies by updating cybersecurity reporting systems to better incorporate AI systems.\" Additionally, the Act would create a \"voluntary database to record AI-related cybersecurity incidents including so-called 'near miss' events.\"\n\nTo fully prepare for the transformational possibilities of AI, we must enter into this new age with our eyes wide open, understanding that there are security considerations to address when implementing AI. These considerations fall broadly into three categories:\n\nIn this article, we'll take a clear-eyed look at each of these aspects of AI security. Before we do that, however, let's understand the potential malicious uses of AI.\n\nAs with practically every technological innovation before it, AI can be used - and in fact is being used - by bad actors with malicious intent such as criminals, terrorists, and hostile nation-states.\n\nThese bad actors deploy a surprisingly wide range of tactics made easier through AI to disrupt operations in both public and private sector. To name just a few current and potential abuses of this technology:\n\nDeepfakes and Disinformation. For the uninitiated, deepfakes involve creating fake audio or video content that convincingly impersonates real individuals. This manipulated media can then be used to discredit public figures by spreading false information, or to influence public opinion through deceptive content.\n\nIn many instances, they can be used to extort funds by impersonating someone's loved ones over video calls. Deepfakes by their very nature can be hard to detect and stop, making them among the most serious potential threats.\n\nMisuse of Military Robots. Adversaries could exploit AI-powered military robots for malicious purposes. These robots might be reprogrammed to cause harm or disrupt security systems.\n\nAutonomous Weapon Systems. Rogue states or non-state actors might deploy AI-enhanced lethal drones or other autonomous weapons. These systems could potentially be operated without human intervention, posing a grave threat to global security.\n\nSocial Engineering. AI can be used to craft persuasive messages that deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Cybercriminals already leverage social engineering to exploit human psychology; the added capabilities unlocked by AI make this type of malicious activity particularly concerning.\n\nHacking and Cyberattacks. Malicious actors can use AI to automate attacks on computer systems, networks, and critical infrastructure. Techniques like fuzzing and neural networks enable the creation of sophisticated computer viruses.\n\nMembership Inference Attacks. AI models can be reverse-engineered to infer membership in specific datasets. Attackers could exploit this capability to reveal sensitive information about individuals.\n\nThe other side of the coin of malicious uses of AI described above is the equally troubling potential that a user's own AI implementations can be manipulated or subverted in adversarial attacks. There is a significant challenge to preventing machine learning models from being deceived and having their vulnerabilities exploited without the knowledge of network administrators.\n\nSome common adversarial attack techniques include the following:\n\nPoisoning Attacks. In the testing or deployment phase of machine learning, models are susceptible to evasion attacks. Attackers may inject malicious data into the training set, with small, imperceptible perturbations added to the input. This manipulation of input data may deceive the model into misclassifying data and producing incorrect output. The model learns incorrect patterns and may therefore potentially make wrong decisions.\n\nTransfer Attacks. These attacks exploit the transferability property of machine learning models. An adversarial example crafted for one model can also fool other models with similar architectures. Transfer attacks can even target black-box models, where the attacker has no knowledge of the model's architecture or parameters.\n\nPrompt Injection Attacks. In this example, attackers craft input prompts to mislead the model. These prompts are specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities and produce harmful responses.\n\nBackdoor Attacks on AI Models. Malicious actors in this instance insert backdoors during training. These hidden patterns allow them to trigger specific behaviors in the model when certain conditions are met.\n\nWe've seen some of the inherent potential security problems of AI. In the next section, let's take a slightly deeper dive into best practices to address security for AI.\n\nWhether it is personal identity information, corporate intellectual property, or even computer network information, there is a vast amount of sensitive data utilized by AI systems that needs to be protected before, during, and after use. Uses of that data can include training of large language models, input data, or the output of an AI solution, among others.\n\nIt's absolutely essential to protect data in AI systems to maintain privacy, security, and ethical standards. Here are some essential practices:\n\nAccess Control and Authentication. Implement access controls to restrict data access based on roles and permissions. Use authentication mechanisms (for example, OAuth or API keys) to verify user identities.\n\nAnonymization and Pseudonymization. Anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent direct identification. Use pseudonyms (fake names) for individuals in datasets.\n\nAudit Trails and Logging. Maintain audit logs to track data access, modifications, and system activities. Logs help detect unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.\n\nData Encryption. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and during transmission.\n\nUse strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.\n\nData Minimization. Collect only necessary data for model training and inference.\n\nAvoid storing excessive or irrelevant information.\n\nData Masking and Tokenization. Mask sensitive data such as credit card or Social Security numbers with placeholders. Use tokens to represent sensitive information.\n\nRegular Security Assessments. Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Identify and address security gaps.\n\nSecure APIs and Endpoints. Protect APIs and endpoints used for data exchange.\n\nUse HTTPS and validate input data to prevent injection attacks.\n\nSecure Model Deployment. Ensure that AI models are deployed in a secure environment. Limit access to model APIs and endpoints.\n\nSecure Model Training. Protect training data from unauthorized access. Use federated learning to train models without sharing raw data.\n\nSo far, we've spent a lot of time discussing the threats and potential harm related to AI, now let's consider the good side of AI. How is AI being used to enhance cybersecurity? Here are ten examples of how AI is being used in the field of cybersecurity:\n\nIntrusion Detection and Prevention. AI can identify unusual activity on a network and alert security personnel to potential threats. It helps detect unauthorized access attempts or suspicious behavior.\n\nCyber Threat Intelligence. AI analyzes data from various sources, including social media and the dark web, to identify emerging threats. It provides valuable intelligence to businesses, helping them stay ahead of cybercriminals.\n\nPhishing Protection. AI analyzes emails and detects patterns indicative of phishing attempts. By identifying malicious links or suspicious content, it helps prevent successful phishing attacks.\n\nVulnerability Management. AI scans software and systems to identify vulnerabilities. It prioritizes which vulnerabilities need immediate attention based on their potential impact, allowing organizations to focus on critical issues.\n\nNetwork Security. AI monitors network traffic and identifies unusual patterns that may indicate an attack, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nPassword Security. AI helps users choose stronger passwords by identifying weak ones. Strengthening password security reduces the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nUser Behavior Analytics. AI monitors user behavior and identifies patterns that may indicate security risks. For example, it can detect unusual login locations or abnormal data access.\n\nThreat Detection and Prevention. AI algorithms continuously analyze data to detect potential threats. Whether it's malware, ransomware, or other malicious activities, AI helps prevent security breaches.\n\nVulnerability Assessment. AI assesses the security posture of systems, applications, and networks. It identifies vulnerabilities and recommends remediation steps.\n\nPassword Management. AI assists in managing passwords securely. It can suggest password changes, enforce password policies, and detect compromised credentials.\n\nAll of these examples demonstrate how AI enhances cybersecurity by automating tasks, improving threat detection, and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nThe introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning touches nearly every aspect of our everyday IT experience - from enhanced user interaction to operational speeds that are orders of magnitude beyond our current capabilities. The significance of these advancements is comparable to creation of computer networking itself.\n\nTo go confidently into these new, virtually uncharted areas, we must temper our enthusiasm for AI with an awareness of what bad actors are planning or actually doing now to use this technology to their own nefarious ends. The need for incorporating comprehensive security measures with AI, including securing data in motion and at rest, has never been greater.", "source": {"uri": "intelligencecommunitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intelligence Community News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "loren_blinde@intelligencecommunitynews.com", "name": "Loren Blinde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social engineering (security)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial Intelligence Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backdoor (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adversarial machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lethal autonomous weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Thales-TCT-header-image-July-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

To accomplish this revolution, AI will need to spread enterprise-wide in most organizations, enabled by more IT and data centers.\n\nHistorically, technology teams pushed AI. Today, business units within the enterprise are starting to pull AI rather aggressively for specific tasks or operations through verticalized AI models. General-purpose AI models work across a broad set of applications and can input and output a variety of data types, but they're probably impractical for smaller, specialized use cases. Verticalized AI models require domain-specific data.\n\nMany companies testing AI in pilot projects are starting to realize that integrating an entire model like a large language model (LLM) into their core systems to deliver fast and accurate decisions or output is very \"IT heavy\" and most likely overkill. These models are designed to take in extreme amounts of data -- the more data, the more accurate the decision.\n\nHowever, if your application depends on a finite amount of domain-specific data from a single or very limited number of sources, you can deploy a smaller, more focused vertical model. Vertical, in this case, means the model is designed to solve a specific problem or, alternatively, a particular use case or even a process improvement in a particular industry.\n\nTake, for example, a restaurant located next to a sports venue that wants to fine-tune its menu choices and inventory for a specific night. Its AI model can be fed with not only historical data but also data from the local and visiting teams' fan demographics (age, income level, cuisine preferences), the local weather, any competing events in the area and the marketing efforts or spend.\n\nBy leveraging verticalized AI, organizations can move faster than ever before, provide more automated options, optimize resource allocation and -- the most popular use case today -- provide predictive analytics for maintenance to minimize downtime.\n\nThese dedicated smaller models that are processing lower amounts of data will need a smaller and less powerful IT stack as well as less power backup and cooling. This IT may use far fewer GPU accelerators, for example, or possibly need only high-powered CPUs. The IT stack configuration needs will depend not only on the quantity of the data but also on the speed and accuracy that the application requires.\n\nObviously, even if you want to, it's not practical to implement AI into all of your critical systems and process workflows immediately. A more pragmatic approach would be to take stock of existing applications in your business value streams. Evaluate the existing capabilities and see if there are opportunities for efficiency or effectiveness improvements, plus the opportunity to automate down the road.\n\nIt may make sense to start with the simplest process or the one that can easily show improvements such as cost savings, top-line growth or improved customer experience, for example.\n\nThe leading options for hosting are in the cloud, deploying in-house and, most likely, at the edge. Before coming to a decision, companies must weigh many factors -- accuracy, cost, control, availability, scalability/growth, ease of adoption, security, cyber safety, time to value and others.\n\nMany verticalized AI applications will use high-definition video as an input. Think of a high-definition camera analyzing wear on a piece of manufacturing equipment or a mesh of cameras monitoring traffic flow in an urban area. These applications will need to be at the edge. Many cloud providers know this and have a strategy for migration to the edge.\n\nIf your choice is to build at the edge or outsource to the cloud at the edge, the advantages of outsourcing are mostly convenience and speed. For companies that want to deploy their own edge IT, the main advantages are mostly about control over data privacy and sovereignty, cost, performance, ethical and responsible guardrails, etc.\n\nWe are at the very beginning of this massive AI wave. Edge AI is most likely less than 5% of the still-nascent data center edge buildout, and cloud edge buildout is only beginning. With the need to greatly improve the efficiency and automation of business processes across every industry, many companies will take the vertical AI path.\n\nThe accompanying data center and network buildout to enable this technology wave has taken a back seat to the incredible training AI buildout in hyperscale data centers -- for now. The reality is that vertical AI will permeate all industries and processes in time. The big question is: Will it be analogous to the incredible sprint race we are seeing in training AI, or will it be more of a massive marathon?\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

The so-called generative AI has continued to advance, with new programs such as ChatGPT springing up, and is capable of producing not only pictures but also writings and video using commands or requests.\n\nThe Defense Department is heavily invested in AI technologies that some believe may be critical in future conflicts. But the military has wrestled with the question of how much troops should use commercial AI tools such as Google Gemini, Dall-E and ChatGPT.\n\n\"The Army seems ahead in adopting this technology,\" said Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, whose research has focused on technology and national security.\n\nGenerative AI can potentially be used for wargaming and planning complex missions. In Ukraine, AI is already being used on the battlefield, serving as a kind of Silicon Valley tech rush for autonomous weapons.\n\nThere are some cybersecurity risks associated with AI when it comes to the military. The data troops input teaches those tools and becomes part of the AI's lexicon.\n\nBut for the rank and file, its use would mostly be more mundane and practical -- writing emails, memos and evaluations. Much of the nonclassified information used for administrative purposes, particularly evaluations, likely wouldn't pose a security threat.\n\n\"For something like performance evaluations, they probably don't have a lot of strategic use for an adversary; we may actually seem more capable than we are,\" Schneider added, referring to how the evaluations can bolster a service member's record with inflated metrics.\n\nHowever, the Space Force in September paused the use of AI tools, effectively saying that security risks still needed to be evaluated. Before that, Jane Rathbun, the Navy's chief information officer, said in a memo to the sea service that generative AI has \"inherent security vulnerabilities,\" adding they \"warrant a cautious approach.\"\n\nThe Pentagon and the services now appear to be divided on the use of generative AI, with two ideas being true at once: Those tools come with cybersecurity risks, and the quick and widespread adoption among the public means they're here to stay.\n\nLast year, the Pentagon stood up Task Force Lima to employ generative AI in the services and assess its risks.\n\n\"As we navigate the transformative power of generative AI, our focus remains steadfast on ensuring national security, minimizing risks, and responsibly integrating these technologies,\" Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said last year when announcing the establishment of the task force.\n\nThe Army has yet to develop clear policy and guardrails for AI use, a process that could still be years away and follow the guidance of the Pentagon's AI task force. Developing guardrails can be further complicated as AI continues to evolve.\n\n\"It would be interesting to see what the limits are,\" Schneider said. \"What are the missions that it's still too risky to use generative AI? Where do they think the line is?\"\n\nThe service has already used AI to write press releases meant to communicate its operations to the public, typically through journalists -- which may lead to ethical concerns at news outlets on whether communications from AI are acceptable.\n\n\"With governmental sources, the potential to dodge accountability also worries me,\" Sarah Scire, deputy editor for the Nieman Lab, which covers the journalism industry, told Military.com. \"If the AI-produced press releases or posts contain lies or falsehoods -- also sometimes known as hallucinations -- who is responsible?\"", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_beynon@military.com", "name": "Steve Beynon", "type": "author", "isAgency":

According to the announcement about the deal - the terms of which were not disclosed - the entire Valyant AI team will be retained post-acquisition.\n\nUntil now, ConverseNow has largely succeeded in winning restaurant chain business through call center voice automation. With this deal, ConverseNow brings a drive-thru AI specialist into the fold, jumpstarting its efforts to penetrate the growing market for AI-voice-assisted drive-thru technology.\n\nValyant AI, which started quickly out of the gate in 2019 with a win at a Techcrunch automation and AI pitch competition in 2019, has since run trials with its Holly voice AI at CKE and Checkers. The company's technology, which is differentiated from ConverseNow's in that the AI runs locally on proprietary hardware (ConverseNow's AI runs in the cloud), also includes a generative AI training application called AI Employee Assist, which restaurant staff can ask questions and receive instant responses. According to the announcement, the Valyant AI technology will be integrated into both the drive-thru and tables by the end of Q3.\n\nThe deal is another signal that the restaurant voice AI and automation is heating up. Other providers, such as Presto and Soundhound, have been growing their installed base for both phone and drive-thru automation solutions, while large chains like Wendy's have been developing their own voice AI technology. McDonald's, which had been running a trial of voice assistant powered by IBM, recently announced they were sunsetting the initiative and would evaluate other voice AI technologies and select another solution by the year's end.\n\nBeyond the obvious employee cost-saving benefits of voice automation, QSRs also see opportunities to increase total order size through upselling capabilities.

Try These Free AI Chatbots For Android Phones - News18", "body": "Meta AI is already available for millions through WhatsApp or Instagram but in case you haven't got it, there are plenty more AI chatbots worth trying.\n\nWhatsApp got the much-awaited Meta AI update recently which lets you create images, take suggestions and plan your next vacation. Even most users in India have got the feature but there are some who are still waiting to try out the AI avatar of WhatsApp and its new tools.\n\nIf you are the unfortunate ones to miss on the Meta AI chatbot so far, don't worry, there are other AI chatbots freely available for Android phones and you can make use of them to do a lot more than what Meta is offering. These AI chatbots have been developed with the trained Large Language Models (LLMs) from companies like Google and OpenAI. Here are the top AI chatbots that can be used for free on Android right away.\n\nGoogle Gemini/Bard\n\nGoogle's AI journey has been a mixed bag so far, which started off as Bard and now the product is called Gemini. It has three versions of the AI model, Gemini Nano, Gemini Pro and the Gemini Ultra. Out of these, the nano AI version is compatible with smartphones from brands like Google and Samsung for now.\n\nYou can even switch from Google Assistant as the default voice command platform to Gemini on Android phones. The AI chatbot can be activated by hard-pressing the power button. Gemini AI can do most tasks which Assistant is known for and plus you can create AI images and other items using text prompts.\n\nChatGPT\n\nOpenAI started the whole frenzy for AI chatbots, at least in the public sphere. ChatGPT is the go-to AI chatbot for millions, both free and premium. Android and iOS users can enjoy the benefits and features of ChatGPT on their smartphones, and do that without signing up if you want to keep your data and chats private. The new ChatGPT 4o version with voice support is coming to mobile devices bringing conversations between AI and humans like never before.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nMicrosoft's AI chatbot is not exclusive to PC users and even Android folks can install the app from the Play Store. Copilot is also developed on GPT 4 LLM from OpenAI but Microsoft has tweaked the design of the interface and other tools to make its own. You can create images using the AI model in seconds, take its help to edit copies or summarise articles for you and more.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/img-2-2024-05-20t160416.074-2024-05-1f39fa493fdc38f04880b11293869309-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

While the AI might be quicker, will it be two times 'better'?\n\nAlong with processing capabilities, power usage is perhaps the key limiting factor of AI, which so far companies like Google and Microsoft are struggling to address.\n\nJim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, stated that the total cost being pumped into AI over the next several years, such as in data centres and utilities, will cost a trillion dollars.\n\nHe then asks: \"What trillion dollar problem will AI solve?\"\n\nWhile some have argued that technology often starts off as expensive and should get cheaper over time, Covello described this as \"revisionist history\", and said \"the tech world is too complacent in the assumption that AI costs will decline substantially over time.\"\n\nHe compares the technology to the internet, stating that \"even in its infancy, the internet was a low-cost technology solution that enabled e-commerce to replace costly incumbent solutions\".\n\n\"AI technology is exceptionally expensive, and to justify those costs, the technology must be able to solve complex problems, which it isn't designed to do,\" he added.\n\nIn the meantime, massive tech companies will only \"garner incremental revenue\" from AI, Covello said, with the more time passive without significant productivity gains, the more challenging \"the AI story will become\".\n\n\"Investor enthusiasm may begin to fade\", Covello concluded, if \"important use cases don't start to become more apparent in the next 12-18 months.\"", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com",

They're also working with foreign governments and Congress to coordinate their approaches to AI.\n\nThe results of their work are meant to serve as a model for US companies, state and local governments, and federal agencies as they deploy AI to speed up customer interactions, hire employees, and screen applicants for government benefits, among other tasks.\n\nHere are five key players carrying out Biden's executive order on AI:\n\nLocascio sets the scientific priorities for the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal laboratory that develops, tests, and endorses standards for a broad array of technologies. In addition to overseeing the institute's AI research, she also supervises scientists studying biotechnology, quantum science, and cybersecurity.\n\nLocascio asked a House panel in May for an additional $50 million to finish the responsibilities assigned to the institute in Biden's AI executive order. This is Locascio's second stint at NIST, having worked at the institute for 31 years before leaving for a research post at the University of Maryland. Locascio, a biomedical engineer, holds 12 patents related to bioengineering.\n\nEstevez is responsible for blocking America's adversaries, particularly China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, from obtaining the semiconductor technology necessary to train AI systems. His team over the last two years has imposed restrictions on the sale to China of advanced computer chips and the equipment needed to manufacture them. He's also pushing US allies in Europe and Asia to do the same, including Japan and the Netherlands.\n\nEstevez spent 36 years at the Department of Defense, including a stint overseeing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon's research and development arm. His team, as part of Biden's executive order on AI, is charged with monitoring US AI developers and how they're designing advanced AI models.\n\nKelly heads the AI Safety Institute, the team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology tasked with developing the AI tests, definitions, and voluntary standards ordered by Biden in his October directive on the technology.\n\nMore than 200 companies, civil society groups, and researchers have agreed to share data and technology with Kelly's team. She separately represented the US at an AI summit in South Korea in May, where 10 countries plus the European Union agreed to share information about AI models, including capabilities and risks.\n\nA former economic policy adviser to Biden, Kelly helped craft his AI executive order. Kelly is a lawyer who previously worked at and served in the Obama White House.\n\nTabassi, trained in electrical engineering, is the top scientist at the AI Safety Institute. She has been experimenting with machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, since she joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1999.\n\nTabassi helped write the institute's voluntary guidelines for companies to identify risks posed by AI, such as the possibility that algorithms will produce inaccurate information or fall victim to cyber attacks. She's leading a team of scientists digging for flaws in others' AI systems and setting up facilities to test the most powerful models.\n\nKhan helps coordinate AI policy activities across the Commerce Department, including the development of scientific standards, AI-related export controls, and copyright guidance for AI-assisted inventions.\n\nKhan worked on emerging technology issues at the National Security Council before joining the Commerce Department in 2023. He has been a key liaison between the department and Congress on its AI actions.\n\nPrior to serving in the Biden administration, Khan spent a decade as an intellectual property attorney, including a

AI has emerged as a transformative force in a variety of global sectors. India's AI development can be accelerated significantly thanks to the Union Budget 2024. AI will not just improve as an industry; it will help all other industries grow, increase jobs, and contribute to GDP. Eventually, it will put India on the leading list of countries developing and using AI-led and enabled technologies/products.\n\nIn addition, it's important to note that the government has already been providing grants, collateral-free loans, and equity-based funds. However, we need to focus more on tech entrepreneurship and have AI-based funds and funds of funds. We need to focus on problem-solving tech/AI solutions and make existing technology more humane, inclusive, and adaptable for everyone, just like no-code gen AI-based conversational platforms.\n\nSignificant initiatives like the India AI mission (under MeitY), with a budget outlay of Rs 10,372 crore, will help improve our economy further.\n\nALSO READ: Budget 2024 Crypto Expectations: Nirmala Sitharaman Should Reconsider 1% TDS & Loss Offset Rules\n\nBy emphasising tech entrepreneurship, problem-solving AI solutions, and inclusive technology, we can unlock the true potential of AI and make India a global leader in this field. The Budget 2024 is a critical opportunity to drive India to the forefront of AI development, and we must seize it.\n\nBudget Plan 2024 can boost further AI development in India in the following ways:\n\nGuaranteeing moral man-made intelligence advancement is pivotal for maintainable development.\n\nPutting resources into man-made intelligence morals research and making a committed administrative body can regulate the execution of these rules, guaranteeing capable man-made intelligence improvement.\n\nComputer-based intelligence has massive potential for social effects. Financing projects that influence man-made intelligence for medical services, schooling, natural protection, and public security can work on the personal satisfaction of residents.\n\nDrives like artificial intelligence-driven telemedicine, shrewd horticulture, and calamity-the-board frameworks can show the positive effect of simulated intelligence, gathering public help and trust.\n\nThe foundation of any mechanical headway is solid Research and development support. The financial plan for 2024 should allot critical assets towards innovative AI intelligence work.\n\nCurrently, India's expenditure on R&D is around 0.7 per cent of its GDP, which is significantly lower compared to countries like the US and China, where it exceeds 2 per cent. Increasing this investment can support AI innovation and help bridge the gap between India and leading AI nations.\n\nThe development of AI necessitates a workforce with exceptional expertise in machine learning, data science, and related fields. The government should make associations with worldwide tech monsters for ability advancement projects that can additionally improve the ability pool. A recent Nasscom report highlights around 1.4 lakh jobs remain vacant in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics segment across various sectors in India.\n\nAI development can be accelerated through government and private-sector collaborations. These associations can use the qualities of the two areas - the spryness and advancement of privately owned businesses and the scale and assets of the public authority.\n\nAs India is the highest producer and consumer of data, which is the raw material for AI platforms, we have a unique advantage in this space as it would attract foreign companies to do business and invest in India, creating more job opportunities.\n\nIncorporating robust cybersecurity measures is essential to protect AI systems and data from potential threats. The budget should allocate funds for developing advanced cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols, ensuring the safety and integrity of AI applications.\n\nThe Association Financial Plan 2024 is a critical chance to drive India to the very front of simulated intelligence improvement. Embracing man-made intelligence with a complete and groundbreaking approach will open additional opportunities, upgrading the country's mechanical ability and working on the existence of its residents.\n\n(The author is the Founder and CEO, CoRover)", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Electronics_and_Information_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horticulture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASSCOM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASSCOM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Meditation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Meditation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/07/10/dddaf52dbdf1649cbbdacda09b5876001720589155824402_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

This is lower than the global consensus of 63% and U.S. consensus of 69%.\n\nIn 2023, 93% of all leaders and 93% of manufacturing leaders planned to increase spending on AI.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nPitchBook data from last week showed a quarterly jump in U.S. venture capital funding, largely driven by significant investments in AI companies.\n\nInvestors are betting on startups with the hope that revenue from AI adoption will yield significant returns. Nearly 50% of manufacturers worldwide reported increased cost savings this year after adopting AI initiatives, according to Lucidworks' study.\n\n\"While many manufacturers see the potential benefits of generative AI, challenges such as response accuracy and cost are causing them to take a more cautious approach,\" said Mike Sinoway, CEO of Lucidworks.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nGenerative AI processes inputs or prompts to produce new content based on past data used to train it. However, it sometimes generates inaccurate or nonsensical outputs known as hallucinations.\n\nWhile 36% of all respondents expressed concerns about response accuracy due to hallucinations, a higher number manufacturing respondents, 44%, share this concern.\n\nDespite only 20% planned AI projects being implemented by manufacturers in the past year, 55% of them feel that they are on par with their peers in AI adoption.\n\nCOST FACTOR\n\nOver the past year, 70% of manufacturing companies opted for more expensive commercial AI models. Lucidworks suggests that a shift to more accessible open-source models could occur if they prove to be as efficient and more resourceful at a lower cost.\n\nWhile manufacturers are optimistic about the cost benefits of AI, they aim to maximize its value amid smaller planned spendings this year.\n\n(Reporting by Aatreyee Dasgupta in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucidworks", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucidworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/23567ca/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F86%2F366bfd2f175de4b919571b21cc3049%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK690GE%3A12024-07-10T130916Z_1_LYNXMPEK690GE_RTROPTP_3_VENTURE-CAPITAL-FUNDING.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

And the funding comes during a fast-growing segment of the exploding LLM AI market. And global LLM revenue is projected to grow to 260 billion by 2030.\n\nHydroX AI has found that a typical LLM is vulnerable to attack and compromise in as little as three months from release, which means constant security measure updates are a must. So HydroX AI sees great need and potential in the AI Trust, Risk, and Security Management (AI TRiSM) sector.\n\nHydroX AI was created to address these LLM risks by offering a comprehensive platform for the evaluation, mitigation, protection, and monitoring of Large Language Model (LLM) safety and security in the four trust domains: safety, privacy, integrity and security.\n\nHydroX also announced the official launch of EPASS, which is its cutting-edge Evaluation Platform for AI Safety and Security. And this platform enables precision evaluation and management of AI models, offering detailed insights that empower users to understand and enhance the safety, security, privacy, and integrity of their AI systems. Plus, EPASS serves as a crucial tool in a landscape where robust evaluation frameworks are imperative due to the substantial ethical, social, and existential risks associated with AI technologies.\n\nThe platform enables stakeholders across industries to manage and compare AI models easily, enhancing decision-making and improving AI system reliability without having to build an expensive in-house evaluation team and infrastructure. All standard accounts come with essential features, including one model evaluation daily, one attack method, and one evaluation per category.\n\nHydroX AI is now in early development, engaging with major LLM companies. Several of these companies have seen notable enhancements from the platform, showcasing EPASS's potential and affirming its strategy for tackling trust issues in LLMs. These endorsements from leading LLM companies highlight its pioneering role and also secure a first-mover advantage in the crucial, evolving field of AI safety and security.\n\nHydroX AI was launched by Zhuo Li - who was the former head of the Privacy and Data Protection Office at Bytedance. Before Bytedance, Li developed his expertise at Meta and LinkedIn, contributing significantly to privacy and security measures. And the team includes Head of Engineering Yuji Kosuga, with deep roots in the field through experiences at companies such as LinkedIn, Google, and Meta, underscoring their profound dedication to advancing AI safety and security.\n\nKEY QUOTE:", "source": {"uri": "pulse2.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse 2.0"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_chowdhry@pulse2.com", "name": "Amit Chowdhry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Relationship_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Relationship Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2024/05/HydroX-AI-Logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Where Are The Startup Opportunities?", "body": "If you are wondering what the next great chapter in artificial intelligence will be, here is your answer.\n\n\"This seems like as good of a time as any to talk about how we view the future,\" wrote OpenAI leaders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman recently. \"Users will increasingly interact with systems - composed of many multimodal models plus tools - which can take actions on their behalf, rather than talking to a single model.\"\n\nThis is as clear a description as any of the concept of \"agents,\" which has taken the field of artificial intelligence by storm over the past year.\n\nAgents are AI systems that can act autonomously in pursuit of open-ended, loosely defined goals. This can involve making long-term plans, using \"tools\" (say, an internet browser), and dynamically trying new approaches in response to new information.\n\nA concrete example will help illustrate the concept. An example of an AI agent would be a system that automatically books your airfare for an upcoming trip, with no input required from you. In order to do this effectively, the agent would need to review your email or calendar to know when and where you are traveling; remember your travel preferences (aisle or window, red-eye or daytime flight); research and select the best flight for you; retrieve your personal and payment information; and use the airline's booking system (e.g., via web browser or API) to buy your tickets.\n\nAI agents are the source of tremendous hype today, which can make it hard to separate signal from noise in this space. But it is important not to lose sight of the big picture here: agentic capabilities will define the next great wave of progress in AI.\n\nIn the words of Andrew Ng: \"AI agent workflows will drive massive AI progress this year -- perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models. This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.\"\n\nOr, as Andrej Karpathy put it: \"It's very obvious that AGI will take the form of some kind of AI agent.\"\n\nThis article will (1) explore the technological underpinnings of AI agents and then (2) canvass some of the most exciting young AI agent startups today. If you think today's AI systems are powerful -- buckle up for what's coming.\n\nUnlike other breakthroughs in artificial intelligence like, say, the transformer or direct preference optimization (DPO), the idea of an AI agent cannot be traced back to one foundational paper or one particular research group. It is too general and expansive of a concept for that.\n\nRather, over the past two years, AI practitioners have made a series of interrelated advances that have built upon one another to enable progressively more sophisticated autonomous behavior from AI systems.\n\nThe overarching theme of these advances has been to build structures and flows around the core intelligence of large language models (LLMs) that unlock the ability for AI to act autonomously.\n\nA brief word on terminology before we proceed. \"Agentic\" is often used in AI circles as the adjective form of \"agent.\" We agree with Andrew Ng's well-articulated point on this topic: the word \"agentic\" serves a helpful purpose by allowing for more nuance and flexibility when discussing this fast-moving technology. Rather than needing to classify a given AI system as either an agent or not an agent, it can be instructive to think of AI systems as having agent-like characteristics -- being agentic -- to varying degrees. This helps avoid semantic hairsplitting over whether a given AI system \"counts\" as an agent.\n\nOne seminal work that helped lay the groundwork for agents was the 2022 Google Brain paper that introduced the concept of \"chain-of-thought prompting.\" This paper showed that LLMs have the ability to break complex problems down into smaller intermediate steps and then to work through each step in succession to solve the overall problem.\n\nChain-of-thought prompting was not originally developed in pursuit of AI agents; the paper does not contemplate AI models interacting with the external world in any way. But chain-of-thought techniques significantly enhance LLMs' multi-step reasoning and planning abilities, which lie at the heart of agentic behavior.\n\nPerhaps the first research effort that explicitly aimed to combine LLMs' ability to reason with their ability to act was ReAct in 2022, also from Google Brain. While the ReAct system broke important conceptual ground, its functionality was limited.\n\nOne essential ingredient for a capable agent is the ability to make use of external applications: browsing the internet, sending an email, making an online purchase, calling an Uber, building a website, updating a database, submitting a pull request, or any of the infinite number of other possible digital actions. In the realm of AI agents, this general capability is often referred to as \"tool use.\"\n\nA landmark research effort on agentic tool use was Toolformer, published by Meta researchers in 2023. The Toolformer team fine-tuned a large language model to learn how and when to make API calls in order to leverage outside applications like a calculator, a calendar and a language translation program.\n\nMore recent efforts, including Gorilla and Chain-of-Abstraction, have built on Toolformer's API-based approach to enable more sophisticated and flexible forms of tool use.\n\nInstead of a small number of hand-selected tools, the Gorilla approach makes it possible for AI agents to choose from a dynamic landscape of thousands or millions of different APIs. Chain-of-Abstraction, meanwhile, enables agents to create multi-step plans to use different tools in combination, including factoring in how the output from one tool might inform the input of another. Such big-picture planning about tool use unlocks more powerful and versatile agentic behavior.\n\nOne final component of agentic systems, which has emerged more recently and which shows tremendous promise, is the concept of multi-agent architectures.\n\nThe basic insight behind multi-agent architectures is that -- as with humans -- while a single AI agent acting alone can be useful, many AI agents working in concert can be far more powerful.\n\nA popular open-source example of a multi-agent system is ChatDev, in which a group of AI agents work together to build software programs. Agents in the ChatDev system assume roles including CEO, CTO, software programmer, software reviewer and test engineer. Each agent focuses on its specific responsibilities (e.g., the CTO architects the overall system, the programmers translate it into code, the reviewer examines the code for bugs) while collaborating with one another in order to achieve the overall goal of building a software application.\n\nIntuitively, since all the agents are ultimately powered by the same source of intelligence (an LLM), it may seem unnecessary to create a multi-agent system and divide up roles in this way. In practice, however, multi-agent systems perform better than single-agent systems, especially in more complex settings. Why is this?\n\nA big part of the answer is specialization and modularization. When an individual agent is prompted to focus on a specific subtask, it does a better job on that subtask than if one monolithic agent is prompted to complete the entire project. From the human developers' perspective, too, a multi-agent framework is conceptually useful in that it decomposes a complex system into discrete modules that can be independently improved and evaluated.\n\nThe first widely used open-source framework for multi-agent orchestration was AutoGen. Others, including MetaGPT and Langchain's LangGraph, have followed.\n\nMulti-agent systems remain a nascent and fast-evolving technology area, with best practices still being formulated. What hierarchical relationships work best for groups of agents working together? How can agents best share information and learn from one another? When and how should new agents be generated on-the-fly in response to changing circumstances? What is the best way to manage computational needs as the number of agents in a system massively scales? Answers to these questions and more are being hashed out by AI builders in real-time.\n\nTomorrow's leading AI applications will be agentic at their core. This will be one of the defining themes of artificial intelligence in the years ahead. This leaves the question: what are the most compelling opportunities for startups to pursue in this area today?\n\nOne common mental model in the world of early-stage technology is to categorize startups as either infrastructure companies or application companies. In a nutshell, infrastructure companies build the underlying tools and platforms that serve as enablers on top of which application companies build products for end customers.\n\nConventional wisdom has it that, in any new technology wave, opportunities at the infrastructure layer tend to precede opportunities at the application layer. It makes intuitive sense, after all, that the right infrastructure needs to be in place first in order to support the development of robust, mature, scalable applications. Venture capitalists have long been fond of the \"picks and shovels\" thesis. (\"When everyone is looking for gold, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business,\" as Mark Twain famously put it.)\n\nAnd there is certainly a lot of startup activity happening at the infrastructure layer for agents today. Startups have recently emerged to build tools for agents in areas like orchestration, memory, authentication and hosting.\n\nYet utilization of all this tooling remains very low, despite the fact that the number of agentic applications has surged in recent months.\n\nIn our view, it remains unclear how much space there is to build massive businesses that sit between the foundation model providers on one hand and agentic applications on the other.\n\nEspecially at this early stage of the technology's life cycle, before product architectures have become standardized and interoperable, most of today's agent-based products are powered by internally built tooling that is coupled tightly with the application. And as the underlying foundation models continue to advance, they will be able to handle more and more of the \"heavy lifting\" that agentic infrastructure would otherwise be designed to solve for. (Don't be surprised if GPT-5 is natively agentic in its architecture and capabilities.)\n\nFor all of these reasons, we believe the biggest and most attractive market opportunities for agent startups are at the application layer. This is where the action is today.\n\nWe will walk through a few specific application areas in which we see tremendous opportunity for agent startups today. But first, what general observations can we make about agent startups at the application layer and what makes them successful?\n\nA few brief thoughts.\n\nTo begin with, fully horizontal, general-purpose agents do not work reliably. The technology is simply not there yet. In order to build an agentic product that can be deployed in production with customers today, it is essential to limit its degrees of freedom by customizing it for a specific end market or vertical.\n\nEnd markets that are particularly conducive to being \"agentized\" (to invent a word) are those that involve structured, repeatable activities. Software engineering, sales development representatives (SDRs) and regulatory compliance are all examples of such functions. Though they involve very different activities, each of these functions consists of routine workflows with consistent patterns that can be learned and audited.\n\nA second characteristic that makes an application area particularly attractive for the deployment of AI agents is the existence of what one might call a \"natural human in the loop.\"\n\nAgent technology is not yet totally reliable. Edge cases abound. Some degree of human oversight can help make these systems \"ready for primetime.\" Yet it would be unscalable and uneconomical for an agent startup to employ people to manually check its system's outputs.\n\nConveniently, some workflows already include a human who is in a position to review and approve an agent's actions without much added friction.\n\nCustomer support is a good example. In any customer support interaction, there is always a human involved who can review and sign off on any major action: the customer herself. Depending on the system's design, a human customer support manager can also function as an additional \"human in the loop\" for an AI agent. These humans' input can help course-correct the agent and ensure a productive outcome.\n\nIt is worth making one final general point about why AI agents represent such a massive market opportunity.\n\nOrganizations spend far more on people than they do on software: on average, companies devote about 70% of their budgets to employees, compared to well under 10% for software products.\n\nAgentic applications are such a revolutionary concept because they are not just another software product to enhance worker productivity; rather, they are workers themselves. For certain roles, they can do everything that an employee can do. This means that they will be able to command pricing more in line with an employee's salary than with a software tool. This unlocks far greater pools of spend than were accessible to earlier generations of technology startups, translating to massive addressable markets.\n\nAnd indeed, some of today's leading agent startups are already having success tapping into customers' hiring budgets as opposed to their IT budgets.\n\nWithout further ado, let us walk through a few specific application areas in which agentic AI startups are poised to create enormous value.\n\nCustomer support is an unglamorous but essential function for any business. It is also an enormous market: the global market size for contact centers (a useful proxy) was an estimated $332 billion in 2023, projected to grow to over $500 billion by 2030.\n\nIn many ways, customer support represents an archetypal end market for AI agents. It is a standardized, formulaic activity in which most types of customer requests (say, help with a forgotten password) occur over and over. And as noted above, it includes a \"natural human in the loop\" -- the customer herself and/or a customer support manager -- who can provide oversight and signoff before any high-stakes action is finalized.\n\nFor these reasons, customer support is one of the first areas in which agents are already in production and creating real value for enterprises today.\n\nFintech unicorn Klarna is a case in point. Earlier this year, Klarna announced that it had deployed an AI assistant powered by OpenAI to automate its customer service engagements. According to the company, this AI assistant has been able to handle two-thirds of all customer service requests (2.3 million conversations in its first month alone), automating the work of 700 full-time human reps and driving an estimated $40 million in added profit for the company this year.\n\nA number of young startups has emerged to build AI customer support agents.\n\nThe most high-profile and well-capitalized of these startups is Sierra AI, which has raised over $100 million to date from blue-chip venture capital firms Benchmark and Sequoia. What sets Sierra apart? Its world-class founding team. Sierra CEO/cofounder Bret Taylor -- former Salesforce co-CEO, former Facebook CTO, former board chairman at Twitter and current board chairman at OpenAI -- is one of the most admired technology executives in the world.\n\nSierra's AI customer support agents can respond in real-time to customer queries; retrieve all necessary customer information by integrating with internal systems and calling the appropriate APIs; and take action when needed to satisfy a customer request (say, updating a customer's address or canceling an international data plan).\n\nSierra plans to price its agents based on work completed rather than the more conventional software subscription model. As discussed above, this notion of charging for work rather than for software represents an important business model paradigm shift made possible by agents.\n\n\"We think outcome-based pricing is the future of software. I think with AI we finally have technology that isn't just making us more productive but actually doing the job. It's actually finishing the job,\" said Taylor.\n\nTwo other promising startups building agentic solutions for customer support are Decagon and Maven AGI, both of which recently announced Series A rounds.\n\nMaven claims that its agents can autonomously handle 93% of all customer questions while reducing resolution times by 60%.\n\nDecagon, meanwhile, boasts an impressive list of early customers that includes Eventbrite, Rippling and Substack.\n\n\"Technology differentiation is an interesting question in this category,\" said Decagon CEO/cofounder Jesse Zhang. \"Everyone is using the same underlying AI models, whether it's OpenAI's models or open-source models like Llama. So the differentiator is in the infrastructure, the orchestration that you build around those models. Companies building agents today are basically building graphs, where each node in the graph is an API call or an LLM call or so on. We have our own views on the best way to architect that graph.\"\n\nCompanies spend many tens of billions of dollars each year to ensure that their decisions and activities are in compliance with all applicable regulations.\n\nRegulatory requirements touch all facets of a company's operations: what it communicates externally, how it crafts its internal company policies, how it executes business transactions, what data privacy measures it implements, what reporting and disclosures it carries out, how it handles its tax obligations, and so forth.\n\nCompliance workflows are particularly well-suited to be handed off to AI agents, for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, compliance work is highly structured, pattern-based and repeatable.\n\nIn addition, it is typical for compliance teams to consist of front-line analysts -- responsible for flagging potential regulatory violations and suggesting remedies -- together with managers who oversee and make final decisions on compliance actions. This presents an opportunity to slot in an AI agent while maintaining a \"natural human in the loop\": the agent can substitute for the front-line analyst while the higher-level manager continues to provide human review before any high-stakes decision is finalized.\n\nOne prominent startup building AI agents for regulatory compliance is New York-based Norm Ai, which has raised nearly $40 million in recent months in two successive rounds led by Coatue.\n\nNorm's agentic system can review a company's operations on an ongoing basis, identify when a certain activity is not in compliance with a certain regulation, and suggest remedial actions to ensure compliance.\n\nAmong the laws and regulations that Norm's agents understand and support compliance for today are the Clean Air Act (213,796 words), the Affordable Care Act (371,810 words) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (22,481 words). Given the length and complexity of these laws, the ability to automatically analyze and apply them is compelling.\n\nAnother promising early-stage player in this category is Greenlite AI. In contrast to Norm, which seeks to build agents for the full range of compliance activities, Greenlite is initially focused specifically on Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer (AML/KYC) operations. Greenlite's agents can, for instance, automatically carry out routine investigations on companies by reviewing documents and searching the internet.\n\n\"Leading banks and fintech companies already trust our agents to automate AML workflows in production settings,\" said Greenlite CEO/cofounder Will Lawrence. \"The status quo is often to rely on offshore contract workers to complete these tasks. So using Greenlite means swapping out an outsourced worker sitting in a different country with our AI. And our AI brings tremendous advantages -- in terms of cost, speed, accuracy and transparency.\"\n\nOne of the largest and most compelling application areas for agents is software development. There is enormous buzz around this use case today (for good reason), with companies like Cognition AI -- recently valued at $2 billion less than six months after its founding -- leading the way. Much has been written already about the opportunity for agents in software engineering.\n\nA thematically analogous opportunity for agents that gets much less attention is data science.\n\nLike software engineering, data science entails complex and highly-paid yet structured and repeatable activities that agentic systems are well-suited to tackle.\n\nData science (or \"predictive machine learning\") use cases can be found everywhere in enterprises today: for instance, personalization, demand forecasting, recommendation systems, dynamic pricing and fraud detection.\n\nOne exciting startup building agents for data science is Delphina. Founded by two long-time data science leaders from Uber, Delphina's agents automate the full data science lifecycle: framing the problem, selecting and transforming data, carrying out feature engineering, training the model, and monitoring and improving the model after deployment.\n\nAs Delphina cofounders Jeremy Hermann and Duncan Gilchrist describe it: \"Delphina's agents can be thought of as junior data scientists. They take care of the time-consuming and routine elements of data science workflows, the way an entry-level data scientist might, freeing up human data scientists to spend more time on big-picture reflection and ideation.\"\n\nLet us end with perhaps the most obvious and clear-cut of all use cases for an AI agent: a personal assistant.\n\nThe concept of an AI personal assistant has featured in science fiction books and movies going back decades (think J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man or Samantha from Her). Perhaps because it is so obvious -- unoriginal, even -- this use case has actually attracted less hype and activity from today's agent-focused founders and investors than many of the other categories mentioned in this article.\n\nPrevious generations of startups have tried and failed to build software that could automate the work of an executive assistant or a personal helper. These products have always proven too brittle for the infinite variability of situations, communications and requests that occur in daily life.\n\nThe advent of large language models -- and the agentic systems built around them -- may finally bring the vision of a competent AI personal assistant within reach.\n\nCompared to use cases like, say, customer support or compliance, building an AI agent that serves as a general-purpose personal assistant is a more unconstrained and open-ended undertaking. A key challenge for startups pursuing this vision, therefore, will be to find ways to put enough structure and boundaries around the problem space that their agents function reliably, while at the same time not limiting their flexibility so much that users get little value out of them.\n\nOne promising startup building an agent-powered personal assistant is Mindy.\n\nMindy describes itself as \"everybody's personal Chief of Staff.\" Users can ask Mindy to, for instance, schedule a lunch and invite attendees; shop for a given item online; or carry out market research on a certain industry or company.\n\nMindy's cofounders hail from the \"PayPal Mafia,\" which helps explain why Roelof Botha from Sequoia and Peter Thiel from Founders Fund -- two of the PayPal Mafia's leading members -- led the company's $6 million seed round earlier this year.\n\nThe Mindy agent lives in email, and users communicate with it the same way that they would communicate with a human assistant or colleague.\n\nThe Mindy team explained the logic behind this key design choice: \"Email is the original Internet technology and is still the most ubiquitous tool used to communicate in the business world. Allowing users to cc Mindy to schedule a meeting or forward Mindy a document for summarization delivers the value of generative AI without having to leave their day-to-day workflow or having to learn how to 'prompt.' Over 4 billion people around the world have an email account.\"\n\nThe asynchronous nature of email enables Mindy to carry out deeper research and analysis before responding to a user, rather than needing to produce an immediate response the way a chatbot like ChatGPT does. It also, conveniently, makes it easier to incorporate some degree of human review before Mindy responds.\n\nThe Mindy agent is available today for anyone to try out for free.\n\nAnother interesting startup in this category is Ario.\n\nArio is built specifically for consumers rather than for enterprise users. Ario helps with tasks like, for instance, managing your family's calendar, coordinating your Amazon returns and building personalized itineraries for vacations.\n\nIn order to understand you, Ario starts by ingesting all of your data from all of the consumer applications you regularly use, from Instagram to Google Calendar to DoorDash to Fitbit. (The company emphasizes its commitment to data privacy and security.) It can then use all this context to proactively help you manage your life: for example, reminding you that your daughter's birthday is coming up and suggesting personalized party ideas based on her current interests.\n\nIf personal assistant agents like Mindy and Ario actually work -- and they need not work perfectly, just well enough to be useful -- there is little doubt that they will be wildly successful products.\n\nThe big question is whether it is possible, with clever engineering, to harness today's large language models to enable useful agentic behavior over such a wide-ranging and unconstrained set of topics and tasks. We will soon find out.\n\nThese four categories are illustrative examples of promising application areas for agent startups today. But this is far from an exhaustive list.\n\nFrom software engineering to revenue operations, from healthcare patient management to sales development representatives, from product analytics to data engineering, many other categories are similarly ripe to be transformed by AI agents.\n\nAnd these are just the functions that agents are well-positioned to tackle today. As the underlying AI continues to improve at breathtaking speed, the set of human activities that can be handed off to agents will rapidly grow. How long will it be before an agentic system can fully automate the work of a lawyer? An investigative journalist? A policymaker? A venture capitalist? An AI researcher?\n\nAgents are not just another overhyped AI buzzword. They are the inevitable future form factor for artificial intelligence systems. Before you know it, you will be interacting with many different agents on a daily basis.\n\nThings are only going to get weirder and more magical from here.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com",

The theme has sent shares of multiple names flying higher, with the likes of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaring by as much as 204% over the past year. However, it may be time for investors to book profits as we progress into H2 2024.\n\nThe AI Rally\n\nThe current AI rally has been reminiscent of the dot-com boom of yesteryears. Any company that announces something even remotely associated with AI has been immediately rewarded by investors with a share price jump. In fact, the AI theme has driven nearly half of the MSCI All Country World Index's (NASDAQ:ACWI) 11% return this year.\n\nHowever, it may be time to book profits in some of these names, according to Citigroup strategists. Citi's Drew Pettit noted that sentiment for AI-associated names is at its strongest level in nearly five years. Several of these stocks are expected to outpace free cash flow generation expectations in the coming periods.\n\nAt the same time, this also implies potentially higher volatility. Pettit suggests reallocating capital from the current AI leaders to other names in the AI ecosystem. According to Bloomberg, market pundits are still divided on whether to bet on AI darlings such as NVIDIA or to go for other potential AI beneficiaries, such as utilities and infrastructure stocks.\n\nThe Risks of Following the Crowd\n\nMeanwhile, the FOMO among retail investors about missing out on the AI rally is palpable.

In addition, 79 percent anticipate innovation at their companies will increase.\n\nOver that same period, they anticipate 56 percent of work will utilize new AI-powered technology.\n\nThe survey revealed there is a strong desire for implementation of AI standards, with 57 percent of professionals indicating a certification processes for AI systems should be introduced, and 55 percent indicating professional or industry bodies should make their own standards.\n\n\"Professionals no longer need to speculate on the potential for AI to impact their work as they are now witnessing its effects firsthand. As we look to the future, one thing is clear: AI-empowered professionals and their companies will outpace those who resist this transformative era,\" said Steve Hasker, president and CEO, Thomson Reuters. \"With professionals predicting that AI will save them up to 200 hours in the next year, the potential economic impact is significant. For a U.S. lawyer, the time saved could translate to up to $100,000 a year in additional billable time, and we can expect similar productivity gains across other professions. The responsible use of AI is crucial, with nearly two-thirds of professionals stressing human oversight. As we navigate this change, we must remember the future of AI is ours to shape.\"*\n\nThis year's study underscores the overwhelming sense of enthusiasm professionals have for AI.\n\nAI, and specifically generative AI (GenAI), solutions for the legal, tax and risk & compliance sectors have been among the most widely adopted categories of professional-grade AI applications to date, the response showed. In fact, 63 percent of those surveyed are already using AI-powered technologies as a starting point for tasks, with research, summarization and drafting cited as the most common use cases.\n\nThe report's findings are categorized into three main themes: productivity, responsibility, and value. The following are some of the study's key insights:\n\nProductivity:\n\nKey driver of innovation, job growth and improved productivity:\n\nThe top areas professionals expect to see concrete improvements over the next five years are \"more innovation\" (79 percent), \"more time spent on engaging, judgement-based or expertise-driven work\" (66 percent), \"greater opportunity for continual skill building\" (57 percent), and \"improved work-life balance\" (51 percent).\n\nAI as top strategic priority for legal profession:\n\nAsked to indicate their strategic priorities for the next 18 months, 50 percent of law firm respondents selected AI in their top five, edging out productivity (49 percent). The top areas where corporate C-suite respondents anticipate AI will have the biggest impact are operational strategy (59 percent), product/service strategy (53 percent), and talent strategy (40 percent).\n\nWhile the majority (63 percent) of respondents are already using AI-powered technologies as a starting point for tasks, 37 percent of those surveyed have not tried the technology in their work, the report found.\n\nAmong the top reasons for staying on the sidelines, 35 percent are unsure what type of work the technology can be used for and 28 percent are unsure how to access it.\n\nResponsible use of AI is crucial:\n\nThe vast majority (95 percent) of professionals agree it's a step too far to allow AI to represent clients in court or make final decisions on complex legal, tax and risk, fraud & compliance matters.\n\nAreas where professionals are more comfortable with AI include drafting basic documents, research and analysis, and basic administrative tasks. A majority (57 percent) of respondents say certification processes for AI systems should be introduced, and 55 percent believe professional or industry bodies should be tasked with developing these standards.\n\nValue:\n\nAI and data to have transformational impact on professional services:\n\nWhen asked the impact of various trends over the next five years, respondents overwhelmingly identified \"the rise of AI and GenAI\" as having the greatest impact (77 percent predicting high or transformational impact), followed by \"explosion in data volumes\" (59 percent).\n\nPositive market sentiment and transformative potential:\n\nProfessionals view AI as a \"force for good\" (78 percent), recognizing its potential to enhance efficiency and bring new value to their work.\n\nWith widespread adoption, we could see AI drive significant innovation, improve work-life balance, and provide substantial economic benefits over the next five years, Thomson Reuters said.\n\nResearch was conducted in April and May 2024 via an online survey. More than 2,200 professionals from the legal, tax and accounting, and risk & compliance fields employed by corporations, firms, and government agencies completed the survey. Approximately 44 percent of participants were based in the United States, with the majority of other respondents in the UK, Canada, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nMost of the respondents were in traditional roles, meaning those in the legal industry were lawyers, those in the tax and accounting industry were accountants and CPAs; in addition, respondents included 200 corporate C-suite professionals.", "source": {"uri": "carriermanagement.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carrier Management"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate title"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certified Public Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/AI-pic-2-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Yet, not every tech company is truly a contributor to the AI revolution. These companies result in overvalued AI stocks and can be dangerous to the long-term success and stability of an investment portfolio.\n\nSo which stocks have received undue attention and valuation, as a result of integrating AI into their brand image? By looking at before and after valuations based on AI implementation over time, we get a picture. Moreover, we'll take a look at important metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and price-to-book (P/B) ratios.\n\nLet's examine three overvalued AI stocks to sell or avoid before a serious correction.\n\nWith OpenAI's new DALL-E and SORA models, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces several future challenges from AI. Also, the company is confronted with the risk of overvaluation due to its own AI experiments.\n\nFirst, the rapid pace of AI software development could make many Adobe video and photo editing products obsolete. Also, it could severely cut into the company's customer base. In fact, many potential stock footage customers may be drawn away by AI-generated photos and videos.\n\nIndeed, the company has tried to use AI products to its own advantage, with features like Generative Fill for its Adobe Firefly software. These kinds of products have seen the company's value surge in the last month. Yet, time will tell if they are truly the value drivers ADBE claims them to be. For now, its P/E ratio of 51.67x seems somewhat overpriced as the stock nears the $600 mark.\n\nUp a stunning 51% over the last six months, investors might want to consider taking profits on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). At February's end, I recommended ANET stock as a strong buy. That was based on the prediction that AI-related services would take it to the next level. Had you bought back then, you'd be up a solid 36% today. That is generous, considering that the stocks I recommend are intended to be long-term plays.\n\nLooking at ANET stock five months later, AI hype may have carried it too far too fast. Its 51.61x price-to-earnings ratio means it is starting to get expensive. Depending on the broader economy and the data center industry's direction, ANET could see a reduction in price on the horizon.\n\nTherefore, investors should take their profits now. Although the stock may continue to grow, it is likely to crash along with a broader market correction which is ultimately overdue.\n\nDespite being up around 6% in the last six months, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) is almost certainly among the most overvalued AI stocks right now.\n\nThat's because the company has no profits with which to justify its current price. It is a product of investor speculation. Moreover, it's hard to gauge the amount of current demand for enterprise-level AI software.\n\nFurthermore, the company's pricing has been relatively cyclical as it rose and fell three times in the last 12 months between the $40 to $20 range. Now, its consensus ratings put it on hold. Yet, I would recommend investors exit the position as C3.ai's major advantage is still its AI branding.\n\nShould the broader market begin to feel that AI has been overhyped over the last 12 months, then we could see a serious reduction in the share price for AI stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These fears stem from that intuition, and the intuition really has to do with the only intelligence that we know is human intelligence, and so when we start thinking about AI, we immediately project onto it all of these human qualities like emotions, desires, intentions, consciousness, the will to power, etc., etc.\"\n\nGiven that AI has none of that, this could just be a bad inference on our part, which, unfortunately, could be fostered by Hollywood movies, science fiction scenarios, and probably by elements of Western culture like Genesis.\n\nSo the need to clearly distinguish between these misconceptions and the reality of AI is of paramount importance.\n\nWhile discussing the importance of making AI smarter for safety, one should also remember that the problem with AI is that it is potentially dangerous, which makes it necessary to make it more constrained and less intelligent.\n\nIn an earlier interaction with AIM, Domingos stated that there is a downside to this, \"It is becoming impossible to keep up with the field. It is good that we have a thriving industry because of its impact factor, but on the other hand, it becomes a lot more difficult to change. We will have to fight this inertia.\"\n\nSimilar to Domingos, Aidan Gomez, CEO and co-founder of Cohere, stated fears of an AI takeover are unfounded due to its reliance on human training data and the limits of exponential growth.", "source": {"uri": "analyticsindiamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics India Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tarunya_s@analyticsindiamag.com", "name": "Tarunya S", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intuition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Domingos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Domingos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will to power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Markov chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impact factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Book of Genesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MIA_AI-Reporter-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

In other words, we're on a long and winding road in the AI narrative that goes far beyond the all-at-once payoff storyline involving NVIDIA Corp. and no one else.\n\nAs we trace the rollicking ride of AI from chips to consumer experiences, nearly every category in the tech industry's ecosystem will be touched and radically reshaped.\n\nThe golden road to riches started with NVIDIA, which has accrued a staggering market value in a short period of time. But it hardly ends there. A wholesale digital transformation is taking place in what I like to divide into three major stages. This is what I call the multi-tier networks effects of AI beyond the GPU and chip manufacturing (i.e., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), extending from inward consumption of infrastructure to sell-out access to compute and software for AI.\n\nThe first network effect entails servers, memory, network, and storage from the likes of Dell Inc., Micron, Marvell Technology Inc., Broadcom Inc., and others. These companies are providing infrastructure for the enablers. (For devices, these include OEMs, but a different set of chips provided to device makers and will add Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and NVIDIA.)\n\nThe second network effect shifts to platform providers and independent software vendors that encompass hyperscalers and SaaS such as Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., ServiceNow Inc., Oracle Corp., OpenAI, SAP, and more. These players are building infrastructure for industries.\n\nThe third network effect entails industries that are applying AI to create new and improved experiences from retail to financial services. This is where the heaviest consumption of the infrastructure will take place, and where the most economic value will occur when we discuss the multitrillion-dollar impact of AI by the end of the decade.\n\nIndeed, concerns over the sell-off of AI and the consumption that needs to take place across industries isn't hard to see. Where are AI and Generative AI being used by banks, hotels, restaurants, manufacturing and other industries -- and which companies are making money from these AI powered advancements?\n\nThis is what Sequoia meant when it called out the $600 billion AI conundrum. Then again, most of this alarmist content may have more to do with AI's time horizon than it does with the long-term viability of AI's buildout.\n\nAmid that recent wave of VC and equity research notes from Goldman Sachs, Sequoia, a16z, one specific example from Goldman stood out: The ability of AI to outperform humans in certain equities research and model building. But Jim Covello, head of Goldman Sachs Equity Research, noted the application had a cost of about six times human capital.\n\nHowever, most of AI's buildout equating to more than 50% of the capex investment comes from a small number of hyperscale cloud providers and massive enterprises that are using AI to power their businesses. And the GPUs aren't exclusively for genAI but for model building, training, and deployment for recommendation engines, video rendering, content filtering, and more.\n\nThese are many of the \"old AI\" applications and they will continue to scale. These same companies, which have benefitted from AI for a long time, continue to pour investment into leverage AI and democratize access to expensive AI infrastructure that will be required to innovate across industries. Still, these applications remain more nascent and will likely take a few years to become widely deployed and fully measurable.\n\nIn the meantime, this waterfall of AI spend that starts with power, thermals, design, silicon and manufacturing flows to systems including compute, storage and networking. Following that, it flows to OEMs/ODMs, and then to ISVs and consultants that support implementation.\n\nThe speed of AI's proliferation will take months and years, not days and weeks. But the claim in the Goldman note that suggests there are zero killer genAI applications is flat-out wrong. Use cases for advertising, search, content creation, video development, rendering, and even private models that can streamline financial services or personalize health care are moving quickly and - unlike the dot-com boom - these apps have legs and will spur market growth.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying there isn't reasonable consternation on the time horizons and the needed returns from hundreds of billions of dollars in capex.\n\nBut this technology isn't cyclical. It is transformative that will change every industry. Some stocks may have run ahead of the market and others may lag in real AI-driven value.\n\nIn the long run, companies and investors that see the impact of AI over the long horizon know that this is, at worst, a short-term, front-loaded capex spend for what is all but certain to demarcate the winners and losing businesses of an AI-powered future.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

The mobile AI era is on the horizon, where intelligent services will be pervasive. So, we must work hard on both Networks for AI and AI for Networks to accelerate 5.5G development and maximize value of the mobile AI era.\"\n\nOver the past five years, commercial 5G has achieved remarkable success and made an unprecedented impact on the global mobile industry. 5G has extended the breadth of global services, delivered higher speeds for better experience, and deepened digital transformation around the world.\n\n5G is continuing to develop even faster today. The first standards release for 5G-Advanced - 3GPP Release-18 - was officially frozen on June 28, 2024 in Shanghai. More than 60 carriers and partners have also announced commercial 5.5G deployment. Commercial 5.5G terminals are now ready to face the world and 5.5G will continue to drive waves of digital development.\n\nOver time, milestones in the development of wireless communications technologies have given rise to several great eras. In 1991, the emergence of GSM networks and widespread adoption of mobile phones kicked off the mobile voice era, and made calling at any time, and anywhere, a reality. In 2007, 3G and smartphones spearheaded the mobile Internet era, and made global information readily accessible. 2024 marks the first year of commercial 5.5G and the integration of AI into a wider variety of devices. The mobile AI era is on the horizon, where intelligent services will be pervasive. We will see three seismic changes in the mobile AI era.\n\nFirst, human-computer interaction will shift from being touch-based to multimodal. This means the ways we interact with computers will extend to natural language, gestures, and emotions, delivering on-demand, 24/7 experience.\n\nSecond, content generation will be revolutionized. Previously, people acquired information mainly through search engines. In the future, such information will be generated by AI. Information production will be no longer about prefabrication, but about customization, making comprehensive and tailored real-time services available.\n\nThird, mobile devices will also undergo a transformation, as mobile devices transition from smartphones to AI terminal assistants and embodied AI. This means mobile devices will become portals to seamless AI.\n\nThese huge changes in the mobile AI era will revitalize society and create tremendous opportunities for the mobile industry.\n\nThanks to graphical interaction, mobile data traffic growth outpaced Moore's Law for the past 10 years. Specifically, DoU has grown by 125 times over these 10 years. This means DoU has doubled every 17 months. In the upcoming mobile AI era, as new forms of interaction sweep the world, generative content will become a primary method of information acquisition, in the place of retrieval, increasing interaction efficiency by 100 times. AIGC will also facilitate the generation of content in different formats, including 3D and spatial video, increasing content volume by 100 times. As a large number of mini models that are built in devices start to collaborate with foundation models on the cloud in real time, the number of interaction objects will also grow by 100 times. All these will drive a new wave of explosive data growth, outpacing Moore's Law once again.\n\nIn the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), intelligent connected vehicles will reshape driving, making the activity safer, easier, and more enjoyable. Intelligent cockpits will create brand new driving experiences and gigabit network experience will better support vehicle-mounted smart assistants, video streaming on multiple screens, extended reality (XR) applications, and other requirements. This will make vehicles a mobile third space suited for both leisure and work.\n\nAt the same time, intelligent driving will disrupt traditional driving systems. Every month, 100 GB of driving data will be uploaded to train the intelligent driving system, making models, perception, and responses more accurate in dynamic driving environments. In addition, millisecond-level V2X will provide reliable and stable driving strategies in real time. All in all, intelligent connected vehicles will unleash the value of connectivity, not just for experiences, but also for time and safety. Connectivity will shine through intelligent connected vehicles.\n\nThe boundaries of the Internet of Everything (IoE) will be also greatly expanded in the mobile AI era. As machines are more able to think and move around like humans, network connections will expand from humans to silicon-based digital humans, which will create 10 billion new connected AI assistants and workers.\n\nFor individuals, everyone will have an AI assistant in the future that runs on their smartphones, glasses, and AI devices. AI assistants will move beyond just being tools and become our companions, responding to requirements in all scenarios like work, play, and learning in real time.\n\nIn industry, every smart factory will have an AI brain, enabling AI workers to deeply integrate into production activities. AI workers will be capable of self-learning and making accurate responses, improving the quality and efficiency of the end-to-end process from production and maintenance to quality inspection and logistics.\n\nThere will be so many new connected AI assistants and workers, tens of billions, that they will eventually outnumber the connections of people and spearhead a new era of human-machine integration.\n\nThe mobile AI era will present tremendous new opportunities. And so, against this backdrop, the whole industry needs to work closely together and make the most of what this era has to offer. 5.5G is a key pillar of the mobile AI era, so Huawei will continue to accelerate its development and work with carriers and industry partners to create new commercial value. This will require joint efforts in the following two areas.\n\nThe first is Networks for AI, which means using networks to fuel the development of AI in order to lay a solid foundation for the mobile AI era. There will be a wide array of services in the future, which will, in turn, raise higher requirements for network capabilities such as large uplink and downlink bandwidths and low latencies. To meet the growing demand for the Internet of People (IoP) and IoV, we will need to accelerate the evolution of all frequency bands to support 5.5G experience, fully unleash the value of each frequency band, and build a foundation for a superior network experience.\n\nThe second area that requires joint effort is AI for Networks, which means using AI to empower networks and enable network productivity surges on all fronts. To fully embrace AI, improving network O&M efficiency is imperative. Our Telecom Foundation Model, for instance, accelerates the evolution of networks to L4 Autonomous Networks (ANs) and provides two types of applications: role-based copilots and scenario-specific agents. Copilots improve the productivity of different roles by providing Q&As related to professional knowledge and assisted O&M. Agents, on the other hand, can understand user intent and orchestrate tasks to automatically resolve issues in complex scenarios.\n\nIn the mobile AI era, a solid network foundation will provide fertile ground for developing innovative applications and business models. We will need these upgraded business models and boost the value of connectivity in all scenarios. In the consumer market, there will be a continuous stream of new intelligent applications, and consumer demand for experience will continue growing across multiple dimensions. This will drive a shift for carriers from monetizing data traffic to monetizing multiple experience dimensions. In industrial scenarios, intelligent services will continue seeing wider adoption and create new monetization opportunities for carriers to expand from just providing connectivity to providing novel services combined with connectivity.\n\nI believe, over the next decade, we will fully embrace mobile AI. The intelligent world is fast approaching, and 5.5G will serve as a cornerstone of future development.

Dynamic changes in AI applications have made students of such streams increasingly adaptive to new technology tools through a continuous process of skilling, reskilling, and upskilling while embracing an interdisciplinary approach by combining AI knowledge with their existing expertise to become more versatile, efficient, and productive in workplaces.\n\nStudents of management, commerce and even humanities can learn how AI is transforming business operations, fin-tech, e-commerce, marketing strategies, customer experiences, etc. AI-powered analytics can assist such students in making data-driven decisions with efficacy while optimising business processes. Students pursuing e-commerce, operations, marketing, and financial management can excel in their profession through the application of AI in achieving better customer experience, efficient supply chain management, improved operational efficiency, designing standard, reliable and robust product quality control methods while determining new ways of reaching and serving customers in a cost-effective manner. Most of the e-commerce organisational websites are currently using chatbots to improve customer satisfaction and provide enhanced services to customers. These chatbots are developed using artificial intelligence.\n\nIn recent years, AI has been greatly used by management and commerce students for predictive analytics, where it processes historical data to forecast future trends while assisting in strategic decision-making and risk management. Students can learn how AI models assist in strategic planning by simulating different business scenarios and their potential outcomes. This allows management professionals to explore various strategies for business expansion and market penetration. AI also assists in automating the collection and analysis of market data from diverse sources such as social media, news articles, and customer reviews. Management students pursuing market research can gain valuable insights on consumer behaviour and preferences from such AI interventions.\n\nThe uniqueness of AI also lies in its multidisciplinary attributes and significant impact on streams of humanities and liberal arts. For instance, a student of literature can very well explore AI applications in natural language processing (NLP) for content creation or analysis. Concurrently, students of international relations and diplomacy can adopt AI approaches in areas of political consulting, policy analysis, and predictive analysis on military, diplomatic, and trade engagements through data-driven insights. They can take advantage of AI-enabled instant language translation to experience the efficacy of diplomatic communications. In contemporary geopolitics, diplomats often use AI techniques for robust planning on strategic issues during bilateral and multilateral negotiations. Moreover, AI systems can effectively model potential political and economic ramifications of international conflicts, humanitarian crises, trade agreements, climate change, and other complex global challenges while assisting diplomats, experts, and students of international relations assess the intensity of the problem and make prudent decisions. Simultaneously, AI-powered advanced NLP models that involve working with textual data, including tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development, can be extremely helpful for the analysis of cultural context and dialectical expressions. This enables diplomats, researchers, and students to navigate the subtleties of cross-cultural communications. AI also allows diplomacy researchers to sift through enormous amounts of data to analyse trends and patterns and predict the future trajectory of geostrategic engagement.\n\nSwitching gears to other areas of arts and humanities, students of dance appreciation can use AI-powered tools to generate creative choreography, enrich performance analysis, and contribute to the ingenious artistry of dance. For psychology and behaviour analysis researchers and students, AI algorithms can assist them in better analysing human behaviour patterns and psychometric profiling and gain insights into people's social interactions, perceptions, and personality traits. In the domain of interior design and office/home decor, students and professionals are increasingly using AI tools to create detailed 3D renderings of design projects. Amazingly, AI can also recommend colour combinations, furniture, and accessories that are personalised to customer's preferences. Moreover, the dynamic nature of AI tools has opened new possibilities for innovative processes. Creative arts professionals and students commonly use AI tools to analyse vast amounts of data and generate unique concepts and unexpected connections, which might fuel their prolific ideas and ultimately end up producing the next creative masterpiece. For students pursuing music appreciation, AI algorithms can compose music by analysing vast amounts of existing compositions, creating new melodies and symphonies and generating unique musical ideations.\n\nOne has to understand that AI's increasing versatility, usefulness and complementarity for streams like management, commerce, humanities, and liberal arts have enormously enhanced its relevance and social acceptance globally. Students and professionals from such streams can bring unique perspectives and domain-specific expertise to AI projects to make them more ethical, inclusive, sustainable, and socially responsive. The participation of students in AI internships belonging to management, commerce, humanities, and liberal arts is rising exponentially, thereby propelling interdisciplinary collaboration and leading to more innovative and people-centric solutions. Students of such streams often possess skills such as critical thinking, interpersonal communication, soft skills, etc., that are valuable for fine-tuning AI approaches. By participating in AI internships and live projects, these students can contribute their diverse skills to tasks like data analysis, user experience design, market research, business ethics, etc., which make AI models more socially responsive. AI applications have profound implications for societal well-being through ethical considerations, bias mitigation, and enhancing accessibility. Students of anthropology, sociology and public policy can contribute valuable insights to help AI technologies be more efficient in mitigating social problems responsibly and ethically. One needs to grasp these concepts to design and implement AI models effectively.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberal arts education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interdisciplinarity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Translation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career_and_Job_Advancement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career and Job Advancement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Image-2-1-1-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

According to the Capgemini Research Institute's latest report \"Turbocharging software with generative AI: How organizations can realize the full potential of generative AI for software engineering\", a large majority (80%) of software professionals believe that, by automating simpler repetitive tasks, Gen AI tools and solutions will significantly transform their function, freeing up time for them to focus on higher-value-adding tasks. More than three quarters of software professionals are confident that generative AI has the potential to boost collaboration with non-technical business teams.\n\nAlso Read: Deloitte Launches an AI and Data Accelerator Program With AWS, Aimed at Scaling the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Capabilities\n\nWhile the generative AI adoption for software engineering is still in its early stages, with 9 in 10 organizations yet to scale, the report found that organizations with active Gen AI initiatives are already reaping multiple benefits from its adoption - fostering innovation coming first place (61% of organizations surveyed) followed by improving software quality (49%). They saw also an improvement of between 7 to 18% (on average) in the productivity of their software engineering functions. For certain specialized tasks, time saving was as high as 35%.\n\nOrganizations surveyed highlighted that they plan to leverage the additional time freed up by generative AI for innovative work such as developing new software features (50%) and upskilling (47%); while reducing headcount being the least-adopted route (just 4% of responding organizations). New roles, such as generative AI developer, prompt writers or generative AI architect are also emerging.\n\nImproved collaboration between tech and business teams\n\nFrom better communication to explaining what the code is doing in natural language, Gen AI makes the connection between software engineers and other business teams more effective. 78% of software professionals are optimistic about Gen AI's potential to enhance collaboration.\n\nAugmented software workforce and employee satisfaction\n\nAccording to the survey, generative AI tools are used today by 46% of software engineers for assisting them on tasks. Almost three quarters agree that generative AI's potential extends beyond writing code. While coding assistance is the leading use case, generative AI also has applications in other software development lifecycle activities, such as code modernization or user experience (UX) design.\n\nAlso Read: Skild AI Raises $300M Series A To Build A Scalable AI Foundation Model For Robotics\n\nBoth senior and junior software professionals also report higher levels of satisfaction from using Gen AI (respectively 69% and 55%). They see generative AI as a strong enabler and motivator.\n\nHowever, according to the report 63% of software professionals declare using unauthorized Gen AI tools to assist them in tasks. This rapid take-up, without proper governance and oversight in place, exposes organizations to functional, security, and legal risks like hallucinated code, code leakage, and IP issues.\n\nPierre-Yves Glever, Head of Global Cloud & Custom Applications at Capgemini, said: \"Generative AI has emerged as a powerful technology to assist software engineers, rapidly gaining adoption. Its impact on coding efficiency and quality is measurable and proven, yet it holds promise for other software activities. However, we must remember that the true value will emerge from a holistic software engineering approach, beyond deploying a single 'new' tool. This involves addressing business needs with robust and relevant design, establishing comprehensive developer workspaces and assistants, implementing quality and security gates, and setting up effective software teams. The focus should be on what genuinely generates value.

Hosted by the Vatican's RenAIssance Foundation, in collaboration with the Pontifical Academy of Life, Religions for Peace Japan, United Arab Emirates' Abu Dhabi Forum for Peace and the Chief Rabbinate of Israel's Commission for Interfaith Relations, this latest gathering for the Rome Call welcomes the co-signage of eastern religious leaders and seeks to shape the technical progress to support the progress of humanity, and inspire peaceful collaboration and global unity for ethical AI development, the core principle of the document.\n\nThis interreligious event follows a series of Rome Call milestones that IBM has played a significant role in - from being one of the first signatories of the Call back in February 2020, to leading the Rome Call for AI Ethics Global University Summit, hosted by Notre Dame University and including 40 educational institutions in 2022, to the 2023 signing of the Call by three Abrahamic religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\n\"AI is a technology with implications across every country, industry and value system - and its benefits should impact the whole of humanity. It is with great pride that IBM once again renews its commitment to the Rome Call for AI Ethics, accompanied now by new, like-minded eastern religious leaders,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, IBM Senior Vice President and Director of Research. \"Delivering on our commitments is of paramount importance, and through efforts such as the Rome Call and the AI Alliance, we're uniting developers, researchers, industry leaders and advocates to transparently advance responsible AI rooted in open innovation.\"\n\nAs a longtime industry proponent in ethical AI development, IBM has worked with organizations around the world to ensure that powerful technologies - like AI - are created responsibly and ethically from the start. In 2018, IBM introduced its Principles for Trust and Transparency and was among one of the first companies to create an AI Ethics Board as an instrument for internal governance around AI ethics, which includes processes, tools, guidelines, education and risk assessment for overseeing the company's AI development and usage practices, as well as partnership with many AI stakeholders to advance AI ethics in a concrete, collaborative and inclusive environment.\n\nIBM's AI approach to ethics is infused throughout the company, including in its products and platforms such as watsonx and across IBM's AI and data governance assets and risk management solutions, reflecting the maturity of the company's journey and the clear vision for IBM and its clients. This approach is also used to develop Granite, IBM's family of large language models. These solutions and models reflect the maturity of IBM's journey and vision for its clients.\n\nAdditionally, in December 2023, IBM co-founded the AI Alliance, which now consists of more than 100 enterprises, startups, educational institutions, government agencies and research labs around the world. The Alliance is focused on accelerating open-source innovation to improve trust in AI, and responsibly maximize its benefits to people and society in an inclusive way.\n\nThe Alliance aims to build a differentiated approach to developing new, cultural and societal AI tuning techniques and to create a more accessible, democratized approach to AI development, with the skills and education to move the industry forward and will look to establish more than just guidelines on use, but rather concrete paths to build AI systems that advance and improve our daily lives. The goal is to transform AI users into AI co-creators, so that each person can maintain full agency and control of AI usage. This is in line with the principles of the Rome Call for AI Ethics, that focus on inclusion, rights and responsibility.\n\nTo learn more about IBM's efforts in AI ethics, visit here.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

Following installation at a state-of-the-art data centre in the province of Bergamo, NeXXt AI Factory, the most powerful NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer owned by a private company in Italy, is now fully operational.\n\nNeXXt AI Factory is a technologically sophisticated system for the development of AI and Gen AI applications and is the centre of an ecosystem dedicated to innovation. Starting today, Fastweb is making the immense computing power of the NeXXt AI Factory and the first release of its Fastweb MIIA (Italian Artificial Intelligence Model) language model, which leverages NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, available to start-ups, companies, universities and public administrations for the development of AI and Gen AI services and applications. While continuing the training of MIIA, Fastweb is also enhancing it through newly signed agreements aimed at expanding the dataset used.\n\nAfter signing agreements in recent months with Bignami Editori, Fastweb has entered into further partnerships with Istat (the Italian Statistics Institute) and Mondadori Media S.p.A.. These agreements have created the largest and most reliable Italian-language dataset, with 1,500 billion tokens (words), equivalent to 11 million books, ensuring a solid and authoritative foundation for the continued evolution of MIIA.\n\nThanks also to the collaborations with Sapienza University of Rome and University of Milan-Bicocca and the immense computational power of NeXXt AI Factory, MIIA will continue to be trained in Italian using only national, high-quality, secure data, in full compliance with national and EU privacy and copyright regulations. A new release of MIIA is expected by the end of this year.\n\nTo ensure the compliance with a \"human centric\" ethical approach in the development of AI services and applications, Fastweb has also decided to create an Advisory Board made up of a team of independent experts who will monitor the various training phases of MIIA. Gianluigi Greco of the Coordination Committee on AI at the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Calabria, Mariarosa Taddeo, Professor of Digital Ethics and Defense Technologies, Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University and Mario Rasetti, professor emeritus of theoretical physics at the Polytechnic of Turin and Chairman of the Science Board of CENTAI will contribute with their activities to certifying the transparency of the governance of Fastweb's linguistic model and compliance with all current regulations.\n\nNeXXt AI Factory is seamlessly integrated into Fastweb's infrastructure ecosystem, connected via the company's fibre network to Fastweb's cloud platform, which spans four data centres and ten edge nodes across Italy. Its integration with Fastweb's four Security Operation Centres helps deliver high levels of security, protection and reliability.\n\nThanks to the combined features of NeXXt AI Factory and MIIA - including their robustness, high level of security, data localisation in Italy, transparent governance and compliance with all applicable Italian and EU regulations - Fastweb's supercomputer can be used by both Fastweb and third parties to develop vertical applications of generative artificial intelligence in specific, critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, industry and education. This will contribute to the establishment of a national AI system, helping benefit all private and public entities that manage sensitive or strategic data for the country.\n\n\"With NeXXt AI Factory and MIIA, we are defining our approach to artificial intelligence to help enable Italy's full independence and technological sovereignty,\" said Walter Renna, CEO of Fastweb. \"AI is the latest milestone in our strategy to offer our corporate and public administration customers an increasingly integrated ecosystem of next-generation digital solutions, from high-performance, reliable connectivity to cloud services, 5G and cybersecurity services. We are now fully prepared to work with them on advanced artificial intelligence solutions.\"\n\n\"Nations worldwide are recognizing the need for sovereign AI infrastructure to harness economic opportunities while preserving cultural identity,\" said Carlo Ruiz, vice president, enterprise solutions and operations, EMEA at NVIDIA. \"Our collaboration with Fastweb to develop Italy's first enterprise-focused foundation model helps build a robust AI ecosystem in the country and drive innovation at a national level.\"\n\nKeep up to date with all of the latest telecoms news with Total Telecom's daily newsletter!

In hindsight, that was a significant moment in history because the start-up went on to develop one of the AI industry's most advanced applications, ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT and many of its competitors can already generate text, images, videos, and computer code on command. But Nvidia and its peers are designing hardware that is more powerful and more energy efficient, paving the way for the development of even better AI applications with expanded capabilities.\n\nHere are five semiconductor stocks investors might want to buy during the AI revolution.\n\nNvidia is best known for designing the most powerful data center graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development. But the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform is an entire cloud-based operating system for AI developers that extends far beyond chips alone.\n\nThe platform offers developers a library of ready-made large language models (LLMs) they can use to build AI applications, which can save them substantial amounts of time and money. It's also home to CUDA (the software layer of the GPU), which allows developers to optimize their chips so they can build applications more quickly. CUDA can't be used with any other chips, so data center operators need to stick with Nvidia's hardware or risk upsetting customers who are proficient with the software.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark in the AI industry, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its Blackwell architecture. The upcoming GB200 GPU, for example, can can perform AI inference at five times the speed of the H100, which will reduce costs for developers, who often pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia stock has tripled over the past year alone, and it probably isn't done moving higher. Wall Street thinks the company will bring in over $120 billion in revenue during the current 2025 fiscal year (ending Jan. 30, 2025), which is nearly double its result from fiscal 2024. The majority of that revenue will come from its AI-focused data center segment.\n\nAMD's data center revenue surged 80% to $2.3 billion during the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). The company expects to generate $4 billion in sales from its GPUs alone this year, which is up from a January forecast of $3.5 billion.\n\nBut AMD has taken a leadership position in another crucial area of AI: personal computing. It says millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI chips have shipped to date -- from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus -- giving AMD a 90% market share in this segment.\n\nThe company is working closely with Microsoft to develop new Ryzen chips capable of processing the growing suite of AI features built into the Windows operating system.\n\nAMD stock is up 51% over the past year, but it remains 18% below its all-time high. Now might be a great time to buy as the company's AI revenue ramps up in both the data center and PC segments.\n\n3. Axcelis Technologies\n\nUnlike Nvidia and AMD, Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS) doesn't produce any chips. It makes ion implantation equipment that is crucial for the fabrication of processors (CPUs), memory chips, and storage chips. AI applications require higher capacities from all three, which presents a big opportunity for this company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's data center GPUs have built-in memory, and advanced models like the Blackwell GB200 even come with built-in CPUs for higher efficiency.\n\nPlus, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require more processing power and up to twice as much memory capacity as their predecessors. As a result, Axcelis CEO Russell Low says AI will require significant manufacturing capacity expansions throughout the semiconductor industry, which should lead to more sales of the company's equipment.\n\nIn addition, power devices (chips that regulate the flow of electrical power in high-current workloads) are very implant-intensive to manufacture. Demand is rapidly growing for AI data centers, which is driving up demand for energy generation, distribution, and cooling. And that, in turn, drives up demand for Axcelis' equipment.\n\nDespite soaring 835% over the last five years, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 18.7, which is a 49% discount to the 36.9 P/E of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. In other words, Axcelis stock would have to almost double just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry. That spells opportunity for investors.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a multifaceted AI play. It makes hardware and software networking solutions for data centers, including its switches, which regulate how quickly data travels between servers and devices. They are key components when thousands of GPUs are clustered together to process vast amounts of data in AI development.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended May 5), sales of Broadcom's Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 switches doubled compared to the year-ago period.\n\nMany of its subsidiaries are also using AI. It acquired Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019, which is using Alphabet's Vertex AI platform to bring AI to its cybersecurity software. Broadcom also acquired cloud software provider VMware for $69 billion in 2023, which allows developers to create virtual machines. This means multiple users can plug into one server to use all of its capacity, which is important during a time when AI infrastructure is in short supply.\n\nBroadcom says its companywide AI revenue soared 280% year over year to $3.1 billion during the second quarter. The company expects to deliver a record high $51 billion in total revenue for the whole of fiscal 2024, with $11 billion coming from AI specifically.\n\n5. Micron Technology\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require significantly more memory capacity than non-AI devices. That's because AI applications need mountains of data to function, and memory chips serve as a brain that temporarily stores that information in a ready state. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is a leading provider of memory and storage chips, and it's experiencing a wave of demand as a result of the AI revolution.\n\nEvery tier 1 manufacturer of Android-based AI smartphones (like Samsung) uses Micron's LPDDR5X memory chip. It offers between 12 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of capacity, which is 50% to 100% more memory than previous flagship smartphones required. Plus, the minimum memory requirement for Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PCs is 16 gigabytes, which is twice the minimum amount its previous Surface lineup needed. This trend spells more revenue for Micron.\n\nOn the data center side, Micron's HBM3e (high-bandwidth memory) solution is used in Nvidia's new H200 GPU. It can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which translates to substantial cost savings for data center operators.\n\nMicron says HBM3e contributed $100 million to its revenue during the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30). By the end of fiscal 2024, it expects to have sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- but that is forecast to grow into the billions of dollars in fiscal 2025.\n\nMicron is already completely sold out of HBM3e memory for the next two years, which should give the company an incredible amount of pricing power and, therefore, drive significant growth in its profitability.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

This was disclosed in a statement seen by Technext. According to the statement, Reactor is a composable, ready-to-use data and AI computing infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking about the latest introduction, the General Manager of NeuRaL AI, Chidera Anyanebechi, told journalists on Monday that the company's REACTOR simplifies everything with no self-hosting required. She also said there would be no need to construct and manage complex infrastructure and there would be no operation of machine learning pipelines, caching, or query engines.\n\nThe GM also said that with REACTOR, companies do not require management of tens to hundreds of gigabytes of data nor are expensive AI engineers or operations teams necessary.\n\n\"What we have developed is assuring businesses that no expertise in data science or machine learning is needed to benefit from GenAI. AI has become a leveller for all businesses irrespective of size. We handle all the heavy lifting for you,\" she said.\n\nNeuRaL AI is a Lagos-based provider of essential support to organisations intending to build and deploy Large Language Models (LLMs). The company has been focused on helping Nigerian businesses adapt to the emerging world of artificial intelligence and also helping them adopt the same in their operations.\n\nThe product of its research is REACTOR, a solution which ensures that small, medium, or large businesses looking to explore how Generative AI (GenAI) can enhance their operations without the complexity of technical setups, can now heave a sigh of relief.\n\nBreaking down the novel solution, General Manager, Anyanebechi, said the comprehensive NeuRaL AI architecture gives the user access to a dedicated \"Metal Vault\". This metal vault, according to her, is located within its virtual compute cluster data centre (REACTOR) which includes a dedicated IP and a user-friendly interface.\n\n\"We manage everything for you, from initial setup to ongoing maintenance. We will guide you through the entire process shown in the diagram and provide training for your team on how to use the system. All this is available starting at just N99k per month, excluding VAT,\" she said.\n\nThe General Manager pointed out that regardless of what industry a company operates in, or the company size, from a team of 5 to a workforce of 5000, NeuRaL AI can demonstrate how GenAI RAG can help businesses and organisations achieve more.\n\n\"Additionally, if your company is based in Lagos, we invite you to host us for a 1-hour GenAI adoption workshop tailored to your specific environment and use cases, completely free of charge. For companies outside Lagos, we can arrange a virtual session\", she said.\n\nThe NeuRaL AI General Manager added that developers and software companies who are looking to build AI apps for their customers can leverage REACTOR to host their custom model trained on their own data for a monthly fee of 99k.\n\n\"We don't charge per token as a lot of others do which brings down the cost considerably. It's a win-win situation\", Anyanebechi finished.", "source": {"uri": "technext24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technext"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-hosting (compilers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cache (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transmission medium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Neural_Networks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://technext24.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dr-Oluseyi-Akindeinde-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nCapital One is banking on its cloud maturity to ease AI adoption across business functions. The financial services company was early to migrate and quick to modernize its data ecosystem.\n\n\"We gravitate towards using the most advanced cloud services and we have been for a long time,\" Aparna Sinha, SVP and head of AI product at Capital One, told CIO Dive. \"It's difficult to imagine doing AI at scale without a solid foundation of experience using and scaling applications in cloud.\"\n\nAs enthusiasm for natural language processing peaked in the wake of ChatGPT's introduction, Capital One's technology division was already well positioned to pilot potential use cases, according to an April report on AI adoption in financial services.\n\n\"We've been researching deep learning and neural networks for quite some time,\" Sinha said. \"Our goal is also to advance the state of the art in AI research, so we look at it holistically, not only from the point of view of generative AI.\"\n\nResearch firm Evident ranked the company as second in AI innovation behind JPMorgan Chase, noting that Capital One and Bank of America owned two-thirds of AI patents filed by banks in the 12-month period ending in June 2022. Capital One was responsible for 39% of the total number of filings across the 50 banks Evident analyzed.\n\nAs part of the innovation push, Capital One bulked up its AI team over the last year. The company welcomed Sinha, a veteran of Google Cloud's developer organization, in January after appointing Prem Natarajan chief scientist and head of enterprise AI and Milind Naphade SVP of AI foundations in 2023.\n\nSinha's remit is strategic, she said. Her role focuses on partnering with Capital One's various lines of business to ease implementation and to build and operate the bank's AI and machine learning platform.\n\n\"It's a lot of the nitty gritty product work of figuring out what capabilities the platform should have and what is the sequencing of those capabilities,\" Sinha said.\n\nThe platform strategy promotes scalability, eases model updates and helps standardize best practices and governance, according to Sinha.\n\nCapital One's AI initiatives are part of an industrywide trend in finance. Bank of America has invested billions of dollars to prepare its data for AI and intends to invest nearly $4 billion in new tech this year. Citi hired former PwC partner Tim Ryan to spearhead AI transformation last month. And JPMorgan Chase aims to have three-quarters of its data migrated by the end of the year to support analytics and AI.\n\nCurrently, Sinha sees value in using generative AI to bolster machine learning and automation capabilities in areas like fraud detection, software development and customer service.\n\n\"Combining existing techniques, like image processing, entity extraction and search and retrieval, with natural language processing is what really gives additional value for a whole host of applications within any enterprise -- and certainly within banking,\" Sinha said.", "source": {"uri": "ciodive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CIO Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_ashare@ciodive.com", "name": "Matt Ashare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiss People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PwC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PwC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Named-entity recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.ciodive.com/imgproxy/saGga2re_Fiw-s1ilato8nuCxatnHPbAEjLQx4gQGpM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTIwMjM0NTU0MTRfY3p0Y2pFQS5qcGc=.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

(Getty Images)\n\nKentucky lawmakers on the General Assembly's Artificial Intelligence Task Force learned Tuesday about how states are using artificial intelligence and possible legal frameworks for the technology.\n\nDuring the task force's first meeting, lawmakers heard presentations from technology and government experts about the history of artificial intelligence (AI), ways state governments use it and legislation in other states. Discussions held in the interim sessions about AI are likely to impact legislation in Kentucky's next legislative session starting in January.\n\nRyan Harkins, senior director of public policy for Microsoft, told lawmakers about the history of developing artificial intelligence and legislation surrounding it. Harkins said generative AI, which creates texts, images or other content, can be used to summarize texts, go beyond traditional keyword searches, create coding and more.\n\nHarkins said that while tech companies like Microsoft have adopted ethical principles to guide its AI use, some bad actors may exploit AI. That's where laws come in.\n\n\"We need law and regulation to play its appropriate role, to ensure that everyone in the marketplace -- that everyone in the ecosystem -- is abiding by certain basic safety and security standards to ensure that we are mitigating any potential risks of harm,\" Harkins said.\n\nThat ongoing \"robust conversation\" about what the rules should be includes those in the technology industry, policymakers, elected officials, academics and other members of civil society, Harkins added.\n\nDoug Robinson, the executive director of the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO), spoke about the various ways that states currently use AI in their operations, such as translating government websites into multiple languages. In some cases, using AI saves time to complete these once \"laborious\" tasks.\n\nRobinson said legislation about AI was introduced in 40 states this year. During Kentucky's legislative session, two Lexington lawmakers -- Republican Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe and Democratic Caucus Chair Sen. Reggie Thomas -- sponsored a bill aimed at limiting the use of \"deep fakes\" or deceptive AI to influence elections in Kentucky. The legislation died in a House committee. The bill would have allowed political candidates appearing in manipulated digital media to bring legal action against the sponsor of the media.\n\nBledsoe is a co-chair of the AI Task Force and Thomas is a member of it.\n\nThe issue of AI interference in elections has also come up at the federal level. In May, the U.S. Senate Rules Committee advanced three bills that would address the use of AI in elections.\n\nStates surveyed by NASCIO reported concerns about the use of AI for disinformation, biased outputs from AI, inadequate data privacy and security.\n\n\"Without that understanding, without a policy framework, without a set of enterprise directives coming out of the office of the CIO (chief information officer), which we've seen from many states, then you have to be concerned about how these tools are being used, and what the impact might be on the citizens and the actual trust in government,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe lawmakers on the committee had several questions about the advancement of AI and how it can be regulated at the state level.\n\nRep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Veron, who is also a co-chair of the task force, asked if AI could be used to improve state government functions in cases like addressing the unemployment services backlog built up during the coronavirus pandemic. He also raised concerns about fraud increasing under an AI system.\n\nRobinson said he viewed that as a \"double-edged sword,\" as AI is being used in some cases to detect fraud, but adversaries could use generative AI in cybersecurity attacks.\n\n\"I think states in the future will be deploying these capabilities to reduce fraud,\" he added.\n\nThe task force's next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, Aug. 13. Bledose said lawmakers on the task force have a lot to discuss during the interim session.\n\n\"This is not a small topic, as you can tell, and it has widespread implications in the private and public sectors, and I think we're going to do our best to be mindful of both,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "kentuckylantern.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kentucky Lantern"}, "authors": [],

Raman was among the keynote speakers for the event, which had a reported attendance of 24,000-plus.\n\nRaman said U.S. intelligence analysts currently use generative AI in classified settings for search and discovery assistance, writing assistance, ideation, brainstorming and helping generate counter arguments. These novel uses of generative AI build on existing capabilities within intelligence agencies that date back more than a decade, including human language translation and transcription and data processing.\n\nAs the functional manager for the intelligence community's open-source data collection, Raman said the CIA is turning to generative AI to keep pace with, for example, \"all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world.\" AI, Raman said, helps intelligence analysts comb through vast amounts of data to pull out insights that can inform policymakers. In a giant haystack, AI helps pinpoint the needle.\n\n\"In our open-source space, we've also had a lot of success with generative AI, and we have leveraged generative AI to help us classify and triage open-source events to help us search and discover and do levels of natural language query on that data,\" Raman said.\n\nA 'thoughtful' approach to AI\n\nEconomists believe generative AI could add trillions of dollars in benefits to the global economy annually, but the technology is not without risks. Countless reports showcase so-called \"hallucinations\" -- or inaccurate answers -- spit out by generative AI software. In national security settings, AI hallucinations could have catastrophic consequences. Senior intelligence officials recognize the technology's potential but must responsibly weigh its risks.\n\n\"We're excited to see about the opportunity that [generative AI] has,\" Intelligence Community Chief Information Officer Adele Merritt told Nextgov/FCW in an April interview. \"And we want to make sure that we are being thoughtful about how we leverage this new technology.\"\n\nMerritt oversees information technology strategy efforts across the 18 agencies that comprise the intelligence community. She meets regularly with other top intelligence officials, including Intelligence Community Chief Data Officer Lori Wade, newly-appointed Intelligence Community Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer John Beieler and Rebecca Richards, who heads the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's Civil Liberties, Privacy and Transparency Office, to discuss and ensure AI efforts are safe, secure and adhere to privacy standards and other policies.\n\n\"We also acknowledge that there's an immense amount of technical potential that we still have to kind of get our arms around, making sure that we're looking past the hype and understanding what's happening, and how we can bring this into our networks,\" Merritt said.\n\nAt the CIA, Raman said her office works in concert with the Office of General Counsel and Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties to address risks inherent to generative AI.\n\n\"We think about risks quite a bit, and one of the risks we really think about are, how will our users be able to use these technologies in a safe, secure and trusted way?\" Raman said. \"So that's about making sure that they're able to look at the output and validate it for accuracy.\"\n\nBecause security requirements are so rigorous within the intelligence community, far fewer generative AI tools are secure enough to be used across its enterprise than in the commercial space. Intelligence analysts can't, for example, access a commercial generative AI tool like ChatGPT in a sensitive compartmented information facility -- pronounced \"skiff\" -- where some of their most sensitive work is performed.\n\nYet a growing number of generative AI tools have met those standards and are already impacting missions.\n\nIn March, Gary Novotny, chief of the ServiceNow Program Management Office at CIA, explained how at least one generative AI tool was helping reduce the time it took for analysts to run intelligence queries. His remarks followed a 2023 report that the CIA was building its own large language model.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced the availability of GPT-4 for users of its Azure Government Top Secret cloud, which includes defense and intelligence customers. Through the air-gapped solution, customers in the classified space can make use of a tool very similar to what's used in the commercial space. Microsoft officials noted security accreditation took 18 months, indicative of how complex software security vetting at the highest levels can be even for tech giants.\n\nEach of the large commercial cloud providers are making similar commitments. Google Cloud is bringing many of its commercial AI offerings to some secure government workloads, including its popular Vertex AI development platform. Similarly, Oracle's cloud infrastructure and associated AI tools are now available in its U.S. government cloud.\n\nMeanwhile AWS, the first commercial cloud service provider to serve the intelligence community, is looking to leverage its market-leading position in cloud computing to better serve growing customer demands for generative AI.\n\n\"The reality of generative AI is you've got to have a foundation of cloud computing,\" AWS Vice President of Worldwide Public Sector Dave Levy told Nextgov/FCW in a June 26 interview at AWS Summit. \"You've got to get your data in a place where you can actually do something with it.\"\n\nAt the summit, Levy announced AWS Public Sector Generative AI Impact Initiative, a two-year, $50 million investment aimed at helping government and education customers address generative AI challenges, including training and tech support.\n\n\"The imperative for us is helping customers understand that journey,\" Levy said.\n\nOn June 26, AI firm Anthropic's chief executive officer Dario Amodei and Levy jointly announced the availability of Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku AI models to U.S. intelligence agencies. The commercially-popular generative AI tools are now available through the AWS Marketplace for the U.S. Intelligence Community, which is essentially a classified version of its commercial cloud marketplace.\n\nAmodei said that while Anthropic is responsible for the security of the large language model, it partnered with AWS because of its superior cloud security standards and reputation as a public sector leader in the cloud computing space.

Adding to this impact is the fact that professional work itself is undergoing massive change, as organizations look for ways to reduce costs and improve their efficiency, and professionals themselves voice their desire for a more rewarding work-life balance.\n\nTo examine this further, Thomson Reuters today released its 2nd annual Future of Professionals Report, which shows that among the thousands of professionals surveyed, the rise of AI and GenAI remains the dominant issue that they see propelling change in their respective professions. The survey received more than 2,200 responses in all -- across the legal, tax, trade, accounting, and risk, fraud & compliance fields, and within individual firms, corporate functions, and government agencies around the world. This itself represented a substantial increase compared to the first survey conducted in 2023.\n\nYet, while more professionals seemed eager to share their perspectives about the forces of change impacting their work life, the report shows a more nuanced movement among respondents' attitudes, especially when compared to last year's survey. Indeed, it wasn't just that more professionals see AI having a greater impact on their work over the next five years -- which is true -- it's also that their perspectives on AI and how it's used within their professions are evolving as well.\n\nWhen asked about which issues they've identified as having the strongest impact on their profession, more than three-quarters (77%) of respondents overall said they believe AI will have a high or transformational impact on their work over the next five years. This was 10 percentage points higher than in the 2023 report; and in fact, the strongest opinion is increasing the most, with 42% of all respondents now saying they believe AI will have a transformational impact, compared to 34% in 2023.\n\n\"Professionals no longer need to speculate on the potential for AI to impact their work as they are now witnessing its effects firsthand,\" says Steve Hasker, president and CEO of Thomson Reuters. \"As we look to the future, one thing is clear: AI-empowered professionals and their companies will outpace those who resist this transformative era.\"\n\nIn addition to identifying AI as the biggest impact on professional work, this report looks at the state of AI now -- roughly 20 months after the public release of ChatGPT, the public-facing GenAI platform that took the world by storm in late-2022.\n\nAlso, the report examines what professionals think about how AI can improve both workplace efficiency and add value to their work products and client services. Most interestingly, they predict that use of AI-powered tech tools could free up the average professional as much as four hours per week in the next year. Not surprisingly, many professionals have strong ideas about what they'd like to do with that extra time.\n\nDespite this palatable excitement about what GenAI can do in the workplace, some concerns around these innovative technologies persist. Yet, many of these worries seemed to have ebbed, especially around job loss and the technology's potential for malicious use, and instead have been somewhat replaced by an acknowledgement that there needs to be humans in the loop to keep AI work ethical and on track. Similarly, fears that widespread AI adoption across professional work would lead to job loss has now given way to an expectation among many professionals that more AI-specialist and technology-related jobs will be created.\n\nWhile overall, the report tilts heavily toward the impact of AI-powered technologies on various professions, it really paints a picture of what type of change is seen as most significant to the way that professionals do their work, how new technology can be used ethically, and what they can expect from their professional lives in the future.\n\n\"The responsible use of AI is crucial, with nearly two-thirds of professionals stressing human oversight,\" explains Hasker. \"As we navigate this change, we must remember the future of AI is ours to shape.\"", "source": {"uri": "thomsonreuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thomson Reuters Institute"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/07/TR4398851_01B_2500x1406.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

They should also use data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to understand the potential negative impacts of these technologies.\n\nGrievance mechanisms should also be established so people can challenge decisions that were either automated or made by humans with the support of AI systems if these adversely impacted them.\n\nProfessor Beduschi added, \"AI systems can analyze large amounts of multidimensional data at increasingly fast speeds, identify patterns in the data, and predict future behavior.

What's more, generative AI might accomplish all of that with impressive speed in the coming few years. Yet, despite the promise of exponential and expedited progress, faster is not always better, and for the unwary, generative AI can cause more problems than it solves. One critical step to lawyers finding themselves on the right side of generative AI use is mastering \"prompt engineering,\" which is the process -- the art! -- of creating the prompts entered into a generative AI platform so that it can return a response or draft that is most usable for your purposes. Think of it intuitively as framing the questions the right way for the generative AI to answer them -- like running an efficient Google search. The better your input, the better the generative AI output.\n\nThe art of prompt engineering is very much in its early stages, but below are a few general tips to help you make the most of your prompts with whatever generative AI program you use.\n\n1. Treat It Like It's a Colleague. This tip is a really general one, but it helps frame the perspective with which you should approach prompting -- that you are asking questions, or giving instructions, rather than necessarily focusing on getting the particular output. In other words, don't treat generative AI like it's Google; instead, ask questions in full sentences as if the generative AI were a person. For example, instead of \"purchase agreement indemnification sample provision,\" which you might use if you were Googling the concept of indemnification provisions, expand the prompt to \"Draft a purchase agreement indemnification that involves the seller indemnifying the buyer for breaches of representations and warranties as well as covenants.\"\n\n2. Choose Being Detailed Over Being Concise. This point may be an opinion that others would disagree with, but we tend to recommend being detailed -- erring on the side of more detail rather than less -- even if your lawyerly instincts tell you to be brief. That includes telling the generative AI which sources to use (\"focus on the ABA deal study\") or exclude (\"exclude the 10-Ks of any companies with a market cap greater than $2 billion\"), which statutes to analyze (\"only focus on the Ohio Revised Code\") or anything else that might come to mind. Indeed, one of the generative AI sources we use caps your prompts at 100,000 characters (the equivalent of about 670 Twitter/X posts) -- so don't be afraid to be detailed.\n\n3. Specify the Audience (and, Possibly, Tone). If you're asking the generative AI to provide sample correspondence -- say, an email or a component of a memorandum or report -- then it helps to tell the generative AI who you're writing it for. Perhaps use something like, \"I'm drafting a memo advising a client on piercing the corporate veil and want to help clarify for the client the risks,\" or \"I'm preparing an email to sellers' counsel to propose a settlement offer regarding an indemnification matter.\" You can even go so far as to specify the tone or the approach -- to the latter example, you could add, \"I want the settlement offer to be friendly but firm, and express that we are offering this as a last resort before going to litigation.\" Adding that tonal clarification and building on the rules in (1) and (2) can provide a really useful response you can further hone. Finally, specifying the audience can help the generative AI make its explanations more intuitive -- you can ask it to explain concepts to you as if you're a seasoned lawyer, a first-year associate or just a smart 10-year-old. Our experience has been that generative AI is exceptional at using analogies and breaking down complex concepts, so the prompts can help be an excellent teaching tool.\n\n4. Offer Context and Surrounding Facts. Much as a colleague appreciates being given instructions in context rather than in a vacuum, generative AI does too (well, it improves the output -- we can't speak to generative AI \"appreciating\" the instructions). You'll want to be sensitive to whether to include party names or other identifying facts (depending on your organization's AI use policy and open source/closed source considerations raised below), but otherwise providing the context in which the request is being made can be useful. For example, in the context of a settlement offer, you may wish to include the proposed terms of the settlement in the prior rounds of negotiations. Doing so can help the generative AI frame the subsequent correspondence, both tonally and in terms of issues.\n\n5. Specify How Much Output You Want. Especially for items like correspondence or memoranda, you can tell the generative AI exactly how much you want it to write. For example, to the indemnification agreement example in (1) above, you might say, \"Draft it in two paragraphs, segmenting out between representations and warranties in subsection (a) and covenants in subsection (b).\" If you do not specify the format for a response, what you get may be meandering, too brief, too formal, too informal, or otherwise require more work for you to tailor. You can ask, for example, for a response in an informal email format using six bullet points to organize the information. If you're asking the generative AI to help craft arguments for why you're taking a position in purchase agreement negotiations, rather than simply \"provide five arguments for why the undisclosed liabilities representation pasted below is appropriate,\" you might add \"but limit each argument to one or two sentences as I don't need too much detail.\"\n\n6. Refine Your Prompt (Constantly). Read the prompt you've drafted again and issue spot for confusing or vague language. Clean it up and then execute the search. Even adding a sentence or two of detail can meaningfully improve the quality of the response -- or alternatively, removing superfluous details can have the same effect. Again, treat generative AI like a colleague, an exceptionally ambitious first-year associate, whom you both review and train. And, of course, make sure that the output you get both makes sense and is accurate (search Mata v. Avianca if you wish to read about one such example of inaccuracy).\n\nTwo final reminders about prompts: First, before you enter any prompts into generative AI, make sure you check your company's generative AI use policy. Generative AI policies help clarify what generative AI platforms employees can use as well as what types of information they can put into the platforms, which helps protect your company's data. If your company doesn't yet have one, but people are starting to use generative AI at your company, then put simply, you should have a policy. Our firm has lawyers who have extensive experience developing corporate AI policies who can help you draft and implement an appropriate policy that can change and grow with your organization and the constantly transforming generative AI landscape. Second, be aware of whether the generative AI you're using is \"closed source\" (i.e., entirely contained within your internal servers) or \"open source\" (i.e., akin to running a Google search). If your prompt involves confidential information, you'll want to be abundantly sure that you're using a closed-source platform -- if it's an open-source platform, you risk sharing your confidential information with the world (or otherwise getting hacked).\n\nThe tips above can get you started on your journey to becoming a more efficient M&A practitioner as you bear in mind both the limits and the possibilities of generative AI. As we (and you) get better at prompting, there's no doubt that generative AI can make us better lawyers.

Bitcoin has full support from banks. In 2024, a lot of Bitcoin ETFs were launched. One of them is the ETF from BlackRock. With their power, they can make a 51% attack on Bitcoin and get rid of it.\n\n2)\n\nQuestion: The conspiracists shockingly believe that bitcoin is part of a \"final beast system,\" which is taking over the world through hard infrastructure.\n\nAnswer: Bitcoin is the next money into a purely cashless, digital form. Combined with biometrics, it creates the necessary technological infrastructure for a one world cashless ID, otherwise known as the mark of the beast, which AI will use for complete economic surveillance and control over the human race. 1 wallet per 1 person, monitored 24/7, limited spending power and suspended anytime by government. Is that what you want?\n\n3)\n\nQuestion: Would crypto currencies like bitcoin or ethereum be part of the AI future?\n\nAnswer: Yes, smart contracts and blockchain have a great use case in AI.\n\n4)\n\nQuestion: Did the CIA or NSA create Bitcoin?\n\nAnswer: Yes. Bitcoin was created by a shadow government. One of the reasons is to eliminate cash on the planet. The banking system is in trouble because people are starting to wake up (not fast enough, though) to the fact that it is all funny money. So they developed Bitcoin, which sounds just great and pulls in all the people who are waking up.\n\nWe all know that the shadow government has technology that is not available to the public. Some people say they may be 50 or 100 years ahead, and they already used AI systems decades ago before they released them to the public.\n\n5)\n\nQuestion: What AI technology we use today?\n\nAnswer: This AI technology is not new. It's not created by humans. It's part of a huge Galactic AI system that is in existence for a very long time, more than you can imagine. This technology was bringed to this planet by unspecified entitites.\n\n6)\n\nQuestion: What is required for AI to run?\n\nAnswer: It required electricity, microchips, computers, internet. The whole infrastructure that was build on Earth in past 100 years was one of the reasons to implement AI.\n\n7)\n\nQuestion: How may future look with AI?\n\nAnswer: Elon Musk already developing Neuralink, which is an interface to connect your brain into an AI cloud system. That means your thoughts that you have will not be yours, but will come from the AI systems. AI will tell you what you will eat, what sport you will play or what you will do during the day. This is of course part of the transformation process from organic human to a cyborg. We all know that modern technology such as wifi, bluetooth or electronic devices are not healthy and causing anxiety and depression. Human body is entirely not compatible with this technology. It breaks the highest natural law of life. Anyone who consciously support this is basically jumping into a boiling water.\n\n\"Eventually, as these AI begin to communicate amongst themselves in a language we will never be able to crack, it might become all consuming.\"\n\n\"What if Satoshi was a sentient AI who invented Bitcoin so it could acquire more hardware without violating Asimov's 3 laws?\n\n\"Think about it, how else could an AI acquire billions of dollars of real world purchasing power without stealing.\"\n\nIn a book an AI program creates a virtual currency that it uses to pay humans to carry out tasks for it.\n\nIt's conceivable that true AI would create a cryptocurrency to help fund itself and interface with the \"real\" world.\n\nThere are rumors of BitCoins being written by AI, and that farming crypto-currencies is building an AI infrastructure. They came back from a future timeline where men and robots destroyed the planet using nuclear bombs, to rewrite a better timeline, and determined that inserting BitCoins into our society would be the best way to alleviate fears of AI and to help humans accept machines. Those who embrace technology would then become rich.\n\nLet me know what you think about my analysis in the comment section, and please hit boost and follow for more ideas.

In hindsight, that was a significant moment in history because the start-up went on to develop one of the AI industry's most advanced applications, ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT and many of its competitors can already generate text, images, videos, and computer code on command. But Nvidia and its peers are designing hardware that is more powerful and more energy efficient, paving the way for the development of even better AI applications with expanded capabilities.\n\nHere are five semiconductor stocks investors might want to buy during the AI revolution.\n\nNvidia is best known for designing the most powerful data center graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development. But the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform is an entire cloud-based operating system for AI developers that extends far beyond chips alone.\n\nThe platform offers developers a library of ready-made large language models (LLMs) they can use to build AI applications, which can save them substantial amounts of time and money. It's also home to CUDA (the software layer of the GPU), which allows developers to optimize their chips so they can build applications more quickly. CUDA can't be used with any other chips, so data center operators need to stick with Nvidia's hardware or risk upsetting customers who are proficient with the software.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark in the AI industry, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its Blackwell architecture. The upcoming GB200 GPU, for example, can can perform AI inference at five times the speed of the H100, which will reduce costs for developers, who often pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia stock has tripled over the past year alone, and it probably isn't done moving higher. Wall Street thinks the company will bring in over $120 billion in revenue during the current 2025 fiscal year (ending Jan. 30, 2025), which is nearly double its result from fiscal 2024. The majority of that revenue will come from its AI-focused data center segment.\n\nNvidia is struggling to meet demand for its GPUs, so some of its biggest customers are turning to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.89%) instead. AMD's MI300 GPU is winning over data center titans like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, which have found that it offers inference performance and cost advantages over the H100.\n\nAMD's data center revenue surged 80% to $2.3 billion during the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). The company expects to generate $4 billion in sales from its GPUs alone this year, which is up from a January forecast of $3.5 billion.\n\nBut AMD has taken a leadership position in another crucial area of AI: personal computing. It says millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI chips have shipped to date -- from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus -- giving AMD a 90% market share in this segment.\n\nThe company is working closely with Microsoft to develop new Ryzen chips capable of processing the growing suite of AI features built into the Windows operating system.\n\nAMD stock is up 51% over the past year, but it remains 18% below its all-time high. Now might be a great time to buy as the company's AI revenue ramps up in both the data center and PC segments.\n\nUnlike Nvidia and AMD, Axcelis Technologies (ACLS 5.17%) doesn't produce any chips. It makes ion implantation equipment that is crucial for the fabrication of processors (CPUs), memory chips, and storage chips. AI applications require higher capacities from all three, which presents a big opportunity for this company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's data center GPUs have built-in memory, and advanced models like the Blackwell GB200 even come with built-in CPUs for higher efficiency.\n\nPlus, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require more processing power and up to twice as much memory capacity as their predecessors. As a result, Axcelis CEO Russell Low says AI will require significant manufacturing capacity expansions throughout the semiconductor industry, which should lead to more sales of the company's equipment.\n\nIn addition, power devices (chips that regulate the flow of electrical power in high-current workloads) are very implant-intensive to manufacture. Demand is rapidly growing for AI data centers, which is driving up demand for energy generation, distribution, and cooling. And that, in turn, drives up demand for Axcelis' equipment.\n\nDespite soaring 835% over the last five years, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 18.7, which is a 49% discount to the 36.9 P/E of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. In other words, Axcelis stock would have to almost double just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry. That spells opportunity for investors.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO -0.72%) is a multifaceted AI play. It makes hardware and software networking solutions for data centers, including its switches, which regulate how quickly data travels between servers and devices. They are key components when thousands of GPUs are clustered together to process vast amounts of data in AI development.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended May 5), sales of Broadcom's Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 switches doubled compared to the year-ago period.\n\nMany of its subsidiaries are also using AI. It acquired Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019, which is using Alphabet's Vertex AI platform to bring AI to its cybersecurity software. Broadcom also acquired cloud software provider VMware for $69 billion in 2023, which allows developers to create virtual machines. This means multiple users can plug into one server to use all of its capacity, which is important during a time when AI infrastructure is in short supply.\n\nBroadcom says its companywide AI revenue soared 280% year over year to $3.1 billion during the second quarter. The company expects to deliver a record high $51 billion in total revenue for the whole of fiscal 2024, with $11 billion coming from AI specifically.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require significantly more memory capacity than non-AI devices. That's because AI applications need mountains of data to function, and memory chips serve as a brain that temporarily stores that information in a ready state. Micron Technology (MU 0.34%) is a leading provider of memory and storage chips, and it's experiencing a wave of demand as a result of the AI revolution.\n\nEvery tier 1 manufacturer of Android-based AI smartphones (like Samsung) uses Micron's LPDDR5X memory chip. It offers between 12 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of capacity, which is 50% to 100% more memory than previous flagship smartphones required. Plus, the minimum memory requirement for Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PCs is 16 gigabytes, which is twice the minimum amount its previous Surface lineup needed. This trend spells more revenue for Micron.\n\nOn the data center side, Micron's HBM3e (high-bandwidth memory) solution is used in Nvidia's new H200 GPU. It can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which translates to substantial cost savings for data center operators.\n\nMicron says HBM3e contributed $100 million to its revenue during the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30). By the end of fiscal 2024, it expects to have sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- but that is forecast to grow into the billions of dollars in fiscal 2025.\n\nMicron is already completely sold out of HBM3e memory for the next two years, which should give the company an incredible amount of pricing power and, therefore, drive significant growth in its profitability.", "source": {"uri":

14 hours to put together'.\n\nThey also said that using such tools could 'boost the human element'.\n\nOn the one hand, AI has allowed someone who wrote a script to turn their efforts into a couple of minutes of actual footage within the span of a day.\n\nOn the other hand, plenty of people oppose AI on the grounds that it's taking jobs and occupations that'd keep people employed.\n\nIt's unlikely to be a massive issue when one content creator decides to give it a go, but there have been times when much larger studios have turned to AI to do jobs they could easily have afforded to give to a human.\n\nDisney came under fire when their Secret Invasion show launched and viewers spotted that the opening credits had used AI and people got upset that the multi-billion dollar company didn't spend some of their money on a person to do that job.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gremlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paranormal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extinction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viz_Media", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viz Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret Invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_credits", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening credits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/bltda1a705954fd2184/668d5236f3c1536efcd6824b/AI-generated-programme-humans.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Think fintech giants Revolut and Wise, public transit app Citymapper and food delivery mainstay Deliveroo.\n\nNow, the London-based venture capital fund has raised $2.3 billion from investors to capitalize on the recent surge of AI companies in Europe and beyond, Index announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're just beginning to see where AI can make a difference,\" Hannah Seal, partner at Index Ventures, told Fortune Wednesday. \"That's why this is so timely because this is the point at which we really see AI, especially in the application layer, starting to come to fruition.\"\n\nSeal said she sees new opportunities in industries like healthcare, hospitality, and education, and historically \"uninvestable\" sectors that have opened up thanks to AI.\n\nThe VC firm, which has offices in London, San Francisco, and New York, will dedicate $800 million of the new capital towards its venture funds and $1.5 billion to growth funds.\n\nIndex is no stranger to investing in AI companies. Last year, it was among French startup Mistral's backers in a $113 million funding round, which increased Mistral's valuation to \u20ac240 million ($260 million). Now, it is Europe's most valuable AI company at \u20ac6 billion ($6.5 billion). Scale AI and Wordsmith are also among Index's other investments.\n\nTo be sure, Index's funds won't be devoted only to AI companies, although they will be a big focus.\n\nThe fresh capital comes just as the VC industry starts to see early signs of recovering from the spigots running dry over the last few years, balancing out the tech investment spree during the pandemic. For instance, earlier this year, Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent Silicon Valley VC player, announced $7.2 billion in new funding.\n\n\"The era of the quick buck mentality is over, and there's a lot of focus on building long-term enduring companies,\" Seal said.\n\nAI's 'earliest innings'\n\nThe world of AI is evolving by the day. Still, \"we're really at the earliest innings\" when it comes to discovering the tech's true capabilities across different industries, Seal told Fortune.\n\n\"Going forward, there'll be very few sort of AI native companies and non-AI companies,\" she said, using the example of mobile companies that feed into the broader technology ecosystem. \"AI will permeate every company at some point in the future.\"\n\nWhile we're still scratching the surface when it comes to AI, Index bases its bets on the founders at the helm of startups.\n\n\"We really need to believe when we are backing founders that they are it for the long run ... [it's their] life's mission to do this and solve this problem and build this company. And they're few and far between,\" Seal said.\n\nIt's not about AI talent\n\nWhile Europe has seen some prominent players emerge in the recent generative AI boom, it still needs to catch up with the U.S. as fewer companies have achieved the scale that the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic have.\n\n\"Over the last decade of investing in technology startups, I think Europe is catching up,\" James Wise, partner at VC firm Balderton Capital, said at Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference in April.\n\n\"So it's still significantly behind in certain areas. But if you look at sort of dollars deployed at almost every stage here, it's closing the gap with American-based companies.\"\n\nBut Europe and the U.K. have their strengths when it comes to competing in the fast-moving AI race.\n\nEurope has a robust ecosystem of early-stage AI startups, while Britain is already starting to see funds flow to it in the form of big tech investments by Microsoft and Salesforce's AI hubs. Index has invented \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) in U.K. tech, having backed 17 unicorns.\n\nLondon, the home of DeepMind, is among the most attractive locations for talent, and several European universities where AI founders started their careers are the breeding grounds for the next wave of companies.\n\n\"We think Europe is going to be one of the most important ecosystems for AI,\" Seal said, adding that Index is \"excited to double down\" on investing in the region.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

From the advent of personal computers in the 1970s to the introduction of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, followed by the emergence of smartphones, social media, and cloud computing in the 2000s, recent decades have seen significant shifts in how we work. And now, in the 2020s, the latest transformational force appears to be artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe field of AI research dates to the 1950s but has blossomed in recent years. Machine learning algorithms are now integrated into various products and services, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and self-driving vehicles. Recently, the development of generative AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini has enabled users to interact with sophisticated chatbots and generate text or images based on prompts. For many, these innovations have shifted AI from a science fiction concept to a practical tool for work and creative pursuits.\n\nGlobal Growth in Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe number of AI patent filings has increased exponentially in recent years\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Center for Security and Emerging Technology data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nBeyond the well-known products and media attention, progress in AI is further demonstrated by the surge in research and development. According to Stanford University's 2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report, AI-related patent filings have increased exponentially, from approximately 3,500 in 2010 to over 190,000 in 2022. Similarly, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled over the same period, rising from around 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 by 2022.\n\nThis extensive research has led to rapid improvements in AI performance across various competencies. For example, the most advanced AI systems now outperform humans in image, language, handwriting, and speech recognition, as well as language understanding and reading comprehension. As of last year, these models nearly matched human performance on predictive reasoning tests, heightening concerns about the potential impact of AI on the workforce.\n\nAI Exposure & Automation Risk by Occupation\n\nNearly 9% of workers have high AI exposure & high automation risk\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013) data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nWith the proliferation of AI-related research and new AI-enabled technologies, computers now have the potential to disrupt many industries and occupations previously believed to be insulated from automation. Historically, jobs at the highest risk of computerized automation involved repetitive, low-complexity tasks, such as those performed by assembly line workers or farm laborers. However, the range of workers at risk of job displacement has now broadened.\n\nOne useful way to understand AI's impact on the labor force is to classify occupations based on their degree of AI exposure -- how integral AI is predicted to be in their field -- and the probability of computerized automation. For instance, professions like lawyers, CEOs, and civil engineers might rely on AI to enhance decision-making but face low probabilities of being completely automated. These high-AI-exposure, low-automation-risk professions make up an estimated 16% of the U.S. workforce.\n\nConversely, occupations with both high AI exposure and high risk of automation include loan officers, accountants, and paralegals, whose tasks and knowledge can be more easily learned and replicated by AI systems. These roles account for an estimated 9% of all workers nationally.\n\nMore from this section 8.3% of Vermont Workers Are at Risk of AI Job Displacement, 12th Lowest in the U.S. Counties with the highest unemployment in Vermont How many people are receiving mental health treatment in Vermont\n\nThe majority of occupations, about 75% of total employment, are unlikely to be significantly impacted by AI but may face other types of automation risks. Jobs such as farm laborers or fast food cooks can be automated using non-AI-based computerized machines. Workers who face both low AI exposure and low risk of automation include highly hands-on professionals like dancers, firefighters, and plumbers.\n\nAI Job Displacement by Location\n\nCompared to other types of automation, AI will have a greater impact on high-income workers\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013), Bureau of Labor Statistics data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nThe trend toward computerized automation has historically made lower-income jobs more vulnerable to displacement, but AI changes that dynamic. AI-related automation shows a loose positive correlation with income, suggesting that higher earners may now face greater risk.\n\nDue to the distribution of industries and jobs across the country, AI-driven job displacement is likely to impact some areas more than others. In five states -- South Dakota, Kansas, Delaware, Florida, and New York -- more than one in ten workers are vulnerable to AI-related automation, facing both high levels of AI exposure and high probabilities of automation. These states have high concentrations of workers in the knowledge sector. Conversely, states like Indiana, Arkansas, and Nevada, where the workforce is more concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing, or service professions, face a lower risk of AI-driven automation. However, general automation could still impact up to half of the workforce in these areas.\n\nAmong major metropolitan areas with populations of one million or more, locations in Florida and New York account for four of the top five regions at greatest risk of AI job displacement. These include Tampa, Miami, Jacksonville, and Buffalo, which have higher concentrations of workers in sectors susceptible to AI automation. In contrast, the two major metros facing the lowest risk of AI-related job loss are both in California: Riverside and San Jose.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by (un)Common Logic, a data-driven digital marketing agency, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources. To determine the locations with the most workers at risk of AI-related job displacement, researchers calculated the percentage of workers in occupations that have both high AI exposure and high probabilities of computerization. For the purpose of this analysis, high AI exposure was defined as being at least one standard deviation above the mean and high probability of computerization was defined as being 70% or more.\n\nHere is a summary of the data for Vermont:\n\nShare of workers at risk of AI-related automation: 8.3% Total workers at risk of AI-related automation: 24,867Share of workers at risk of any computerized automation: 42.0%Total workers at risk of any computerized automation: 126,266Median annual wage: $49,630\n\nFor reference, here are the statistics for the entire United States:\n\nShare of workers at risk of AI-related automation: 8.9%Total workers at risk of AI-related automation: 13,469,438Share of workers at risk of any computerized automation: 43.9%Total workers at risk of any computerized automation: 66,695,676Median annual wage: $48,060\n\nFor more information, a detailed methodology, and complete results, see Cities With the Most Workers at Risk of AI Job Displacement on (un)Common

There are some valuable use cases of AI in the provider space, without a doubt. Ambient AI scribes, for example, have generally been met with open arms among providers, as they reduce administrative burdens and free up more time to spend with the patient.\n\nBut many iterations of AI are within a realm that feels like the Wild West, where bold claims abound but aren't backed up by clinical research or regulatory oversight. This isn't surprising, though, as many companies offering AI would rather not endure the rigorous procedures and significant time investment to obtain regulatory clearance.\n\nThe consequences of AI that's unchecked may not be as severe in other industries, but in healthcare, a faulty algorithm can be a matter of life and death. As healthcare becomes saturated with AI solutions that blur the line between what's regulated and what isn't, clinicians have been left in the dark and are pushing back. In one recent example, nurses in San Francisco protested Kaiser Permanente's use of AI, claiming the technology is degrading and devaluing the role of nurses, ultimately putting patient safety at risk. It's important to note that their concern is directed specifically to \"untested\" forms of AI, which should be a wake-up call to companies who are hesitant to secure regulatory clearance.\n\nThe marketplace needs guidance on how to navigate the AI landscape with so many players making bold but unsubstantiated claims. One of the smartest things companies offering AI can do is to recognize the value of clinical validation and regulation, which is fundamental to gaining clinicians' trust and ensuring the safety of their products. This, combined with a thoughtful approach to change management, will create a level playing field where the coexistence of AI and clinicians brings healthcare to the next level.\n\nApproaching AI development through a regulatory-grade lens\n\nWhen starting down the path to FDA clearance, companies should have a clear goal about what they're trying to prove and be able to articulate the clinical value that they're aiming to deliver. The ability to demonstrate that a solution is positively impacting the care of a patient and not creating patient safety issues is crucial. Committing to these fundamental principles upfront ensures that there's a level of responsibility built into AI models.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) companies should also be generally aware of the FDA's approach to medical device clearance, which measures the quality of the end-to-end development process, including clinical validation studies performed in real-world patient populations. Furthermore, post-market surveillance requirements ensure the continued safety and performance of devices while on the market. Having this insight can inform the development of AI that's designed, developed, tested, and validated with at least the same rigor as the devices their customers are likely already using.\n\nDeveloping a solid working relationship with the FDA is also key. Bringing in a regulatory consultant who knows how to navigate the process is a great way to jumpstart this relationship. The value of this is two-fold, as the company gains valuable insights, and the regulators receive submissions that meet their exact specifications. This is particularly beneficial to the FDA, as they face a deluge of AI solutions coming into the market.\n\nBolstering regulatory quality with change management\n\nOnce a company commits to the regulatory process, the success of deploying a clinical AI solution then depends on the human change management that goes alongside to ensure that clinicians adopt the solution in their daily workflow. Part of the regulatory process involves testing the solution in real-world settings and, ideally, incorporating clinicians' feedback. This is not something that should end once a solution is cleared, healthcare organizations must continue working with AI developers to understand how to implement the tool in a practical way. Be mindful of the individual clinician's perspective to ensure their lives are made better by the solution and that patient safety and outcomes will be improved too.\n\nPerhaps the most important message to convey during implementation is that the solution is not there to replace the clinician, rather it's meant to augment and allow the clinician to practice at the top of their license. Emphasize the value-add - it's not just another piece of technology that gets in the way and hinders clinicians' ability, but rather that it's improving their management of patients. The true opportunity with AI is that it enables clinicians to get back to doing the things that they were trained to do - and that they enjoy doing. AI can handle the repetitive, prescriptive tasks that bog clinicians down, leaving them with more time focused on direct patient care. This concept is at the core of why they became clinicians in the first place.\n\nUpdating regulatory standards to promote patient safety\n\nIt's time to enhance the current regulatory framework and adapt it to contemporary approaches. Regulating AI should be viewed as a spectrum. Solutions that address back-office manual processes certainly need to have oversight and constraints on how they're marketed, but their level of risk differs from clinically oriented solutions used alongside clinicians. Clinical and other forms of AI that are deemed more consequential require the appropriate protections to ensure patient safety and care quality are not harmed in the process. Regulatory bodies like the FDA have limited bandwidth, so a tiered approach helps to triage and prioritize the review of AI that carries greater risk.\n\nRegulating these solutions ensures that they are deployed with a strong regard for patient safety and the Hippocratic Oath's 'do no harm' mantra is maintained. Ultimately, perseverance is the key to optimizing care quality. These processes don't happen overnight, they require significant investment and patience. To leverage AI in clinical settings, healthcare organizations need to be committed to this for the long term.\n\nPhoto: Carol Yepes, getty Images\n\nThis post appears through the MedCity Influencers program.

The Czech Republic is not expected to enact its own complex regulation of AI, as the EU AI Act is expected to fulfill this function for all EU Member States. However, the Czech Republic is active on the AI policy level and shall adopt national AI Regulations where the EU AI Act provides for its adaptation (similar to other EU Member States).\n\nThe Czech Republic released a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (NAIS) in May 2019, with the aim to support the development and use of AI. The strategy was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Industry and Trade, various research institutions, the private sector, and industry professionals from the general public based on the Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 2019-2030 and Resolution No. 629 of October 3, 2018 of the Czech government on the Digital Czech Republic (i.e., the strategy for digitization in the Czech Republic, which rests on three pillars - EU collaboration of the Czech Republic in the realm of the digital agenda; digitization of the public administration; and preparing society and the economy for digitization through collaborative efforts).\n\nThe NAIS is divided into seven chapters and focuses, among others, on the promotion of science, research and development, support for investment, financing, and development of AI systems in industry and services, legal and social aspects as well as human capital and the education system. To reflect rapid technological developments and trends and the increasing use of AI tools, the Ministry of Industry and Trade is currently preparing an update of the NAIS, which will determine priorities and goals in this area until 2030.\n\nIn 2022, the government issued the Strategic Plan for the Digitalization of Czechia by 2030; one of its objectives is for 75% of businesses to use at least one of these technologies by the end of the decade: cloud computing, big data, or AI.\n\nAs noted above, there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI. The Czech Republic's main focus is now on the successful implementation of the EU AI Act into the national law, which has the following four priorities:\n\nFrom the perspective of the Czech Republic, this means undertaking the following steps at the national level (in the form of AI Regulations where appropriate):\n\nOther laws affecting AI\n\nThere are various laws that do not directly seek to regulate AI but may affect the development or use of AI in the Czech Republic. A non-exhaustive list of key examples includes:\n\nDefinition of \"AI\"\n\nAs there are currently no specific laws or policies in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI, no definition of AI is currently recognized by Czech national legislation. The definition of an AI system contained in Art. 3(1) of the EU AI Act will likely be the key definition used in the Czech Republic.\n\nTerritorial scope\n\nThere are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI; therefore, there is no specific territorial scope set at this stage.\n\nSectoral scope\n\nAs noted above, there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI. Accordingly, there is no specific sectoral scope at this stage.\n\nCompliance roles\n\nAs there are no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI as of yet, there are also no specific or unique obligations imposed on developers, users, operators and/or deployers of AI systems. The standards will be set by the EU AI Act, once in force.\n\nCore issues that the AI Regulations seek to address\n\nAs noted above, there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned NAIS seeks to address, within the AI regulation, issues related to discrimination and data protection and calls for the creation of an administrative and legislative framework for AI that prevents any form of misuse of AI, discrimination, or disadvantage, with a fundamental emphasis on protecting rights and privacy.\n\nRisk categorization\n\nAs noted above, there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI and the aforementioned NAIS does not set out any AI-related risk categorization.\n\nKey compliance requirements\n\nAs there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI, there are no specific AI-related national compliance requirements.\n\nRegulators\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade coordinates the overall AI strategy, while the competent ministries and other state authorities in each respective area are expected to participate in internal regulatory processes. These include, inter alia, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic.\n\nIn addition, there are ongoing discussions as to which Czech authority will be designated as the national supervisory authority required under the EU AI Act. Potential candidates include the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Czech Governmental Office, the Office for Personal Data Protection, or the Czech Telecommunication Office.\n\nImportant factors that are being considered with respect to the designation are:\n\nEnforcement powers and penalties\n\nAs noted above, there are currently no specific laws or regulations in the Czech Republic that directly regulate AI. As such, enforcement and penalties relating to the creation, dissemination and/or use of AI are governed by: (i) the EU AI Act; and (ii) pertinent provisions in non-AI specific regulation.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Industry_and_Trade_(Czech_Republic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Industry and Trade (Czech Republic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Czech_Republic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of the Interior (Czech Republic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-03", "textStart": 981, "textEnd": 996}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 637, "textEnd": 645}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

They should also use Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to understand the potential negative impacts of these technologies.\n\nGrievance mechanisms should also be established so people can challenge decisions that were either automated or made by humans with the support of AI systems if these adversely impacted them.\n\nProfessor Beduschi said: \"AI systems can analyse large amounts of multidimensional data at increasingly fast speeds, identify patterns in the data, and predict future behaviour. That can help organisations gain crucial insights to better monitor and anticipate risks, such as a conflict outbreak or escalation.\n\n\"Yet, deploying AI systems in the humanitarian context is not without risks for the affected populations. Issues include the poor quality of the data used to train AI algorithms, the existence of algorithmic bias, the lack of transparency about AI decision-making, and the pervading concerns about the respect and protection of data privacy.\n\n\"It is crucial that humanitarians abide by the humanitarian imperative of 'do not harm' when deciding whether to deploy AI to support their action. In many cases, the sensible solution would be not to rely on AI technologies as these may cause additional harm to civilian populations.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurekalert.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurekAlert!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Exeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert-bluebg_Twitter_601X601.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Like any tool, AI's usefulness may be seen in the problems it solves or the processes it makes more efficient.\n\nDowntime in the grain industry is costly. Improving reliability and enhancing safety with predictive maintenance supports operations and profitability. Accurate measurement of material flow and weights optimizes processes, reduces waste and promotes productivity.\n\nThe goal of AI would be to work smarter by augmenting human insight and experiences with enhanced decision-making capabilities, according to industry observers. AI is growing exponentially in complexity, and facilities must have the right infrastructure in place and the right knowledge and support to take full advantage. Responsible implementation is deemed critical, as a strategy that does not align with existing applications and company objectives can be counterproductive and create data security issues.\n\nTemperature monitoring, level monitoring, ambient temperature monitoring, moisture monitoring, fan control, access to bin data, etc., are all areas where AI could prove invaluable to production and profitability. Sustainability and stewardship of the environment are being demanded by governments and consumers, which requires greater data collection and interpretation than previously has been necessary.\n\n\"The pace of adoption of AI technology in grain handling and storage varies across different organizations and regions,\" said Zachary Carr, president of SafeGrain, a grain quality control and hazard monitoring company based in Dayton, Ohio, US. \"While some early adopters are leveraging AI solutions to gain a competitive edge, others are more cautious due to factors such as cost, infrastructure limitations, and the need for specialized expertise. However, as awareness grows and AI becomes more accessible, I anticipate a steady increase in adoption rates, especially as the benefits become more evident.\"\n\nCESCO EPC GmbH is an internationally operating German company based in Konstanz that designs and supplies industrial plants for grain logistics and deep processing with handling, storing and milling systems. Martino Celeghini, chief executive officer of CESCO, is similarly enthusiastic about AI's potential.\n\n\"The grain storage industry is on the cusp of an intelligent revolution,\" Celeghini said. \"Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how facilities operate, optimizing processes, maximizing efficiency and safeguarding grain quality. From predictive maintenance to automated quality assessment, AI is poised to significantly enhance every step of the grain storage cycle.\"\n\nDirk Maier is a professor of agricultural and biosystems engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, US, a longtime educator and renowned expert in grain storage and handling with extensive experience in developing public-private funded university-based training facilities. Maier is director of the recently inaugurated Iowa State University Kent Feed Mill and Grain Science Complex, which utilizes state-of-the-art technology in its operations. While acknowledging AI's potential to further drive improvements in grain storage and handling, Maier said today's advanced technology has set the stage.\n\n\"We have the kind of sensing technologies, monitoring technologies that continue to improve and become more readily accessible, and people will readily adopt them to keep track of the quality and the predictability itself,\" Maier said. \"Models can basically run online, interpreting data being collected in a storage bin in terms of temperature, moisture, and in particular, CO2, and predictively tell you about trends that could lead to a hot spot in your bin. Those are already things that are available and will become even more available as the computing technology improves.\"\n\nThe surging interest in AI in grain handling and storage comes as little surprise to Vikram Adve, professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, US. Adve co-founded the Center for Digital Agriculture and leads the AIFARMS Institute, one of the national AI research institutes launched under the aegis of the US National AI R&D Strategic Plan: 2019 Update.\n\n\"There are various products that you can buy and use that do rely on AI, but I would say the degree of adoption is relatively limited relative to its potential, and in fact agriculture as a domain, broadly speaking, is significantly behind quite a few other domains in terms of adoptions of AI, which just means there's a lot of low-hanging fruit,\" he said. \"There's a lot of capabilities that can make a significant impact, and there's really a large market potential right now for new products and new technologies to be adopted.\"\n\nWhat is AI?\n\nAI itself might provide a unique, almost human answer to the question of its origin, even today as the technology continues to evolve.\n\nThe recent attention given to AI in the public consciousness likely can be traced to the 2022 emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI system that uses a large-language model to engage users in humanlike conversation and churn out topical written documents, which seemed to jump-start global excitement and questions about its potential.\n\nThe concept of AI goes back several decades to the earliest computers, when programmers pondered the very idea that a machine could replicate human thought patterns and intuitively learn new skills or generate unique ideas. As the processing power of computers grew, so did expectations for AI technology.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT and other language models are but one subset for AI.\n\nAdve described AI as a particular class of techniques, with some aspects that have been extremely successful and some that have not been very successful at all.\n\n\"AI is really a broad class of (computing) techniques, all of which broadly speaking aim to mimic or exceed human capability and their various aspects or functions in the world,\" Adve said. \"What aspects of AI are the most successful, the most widely used, have changed over time. Over the last 30 years, the most successful areas of AI have evolved quite dramatically, starting with small successes in handwriting recognition, speech understanding and language, dramatic advances in computer vision, some significant advances in robotics and autonomous systems, and most recently, in the past five years, dramatic advances in language understanding and language generation.\"\n\nAdve said chatbots using large-language models, such as ChatGPT, generate a lot of excitement due to the way they can interact with humans and be used by people on a day-to-day basis, which has not been true for most previous generations of AI. Other aspects of machine learning and computer vision could perhaps prove even more valuable to agriculture over the long term.\n\n\"Humans still far outstrip AI systems and are likely to do so for a long time when you think of the totality of what we can do, but there are aspects of scale, for example, that AI systemscan significantly outperform humans by learning patterns from enormous amounts of data,\" he said.\n\nCeleghini said a transition is underway from traditional programmed algorithms to neural network-based systems of AI to enhance grain handling and storage operations.\n\n\"In this paradigm, behavior is primarily shaped by training data rather than explicit programming, enabling handling of multiple inputs simultaneously and generating complex responses that are difficult to achieve through conventional programming languages,\" he said.\n\nCarr sees the same potential for AI to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks such as learning, problem solving and decision making.\n\n\"Unlike traditional predictive systems that rely on pre-programmed rules and algorithms, AI systems can analyze large datasets, detect patterns, and make autonomous decisions without explicit programming,\" Carr said. \"Essentially, AI enhances predictive capabilities by continuously learning from data, adapting to new information, and improving its performance over time.\"\n\nAI on the job\n\nAnalysts generally agree AI is no replacement for humans, who ultimately will continue to make the decisions when it comes to grain storage and handling. But as a tool, AI does hold great promise for all the systems that currently help feed the world's 8 billion people by ensuring that crops taken from the field are optimally stored and protected.\n\nAI-powered solutions increasingly are being integrated into commercial elevators and farm storage operations, Celeghini said. These solutions are utilized in various aspects, such as predictive maintenance to anticipate equipment failures, optimizing grain storage conditions by monitoring temperature and moisture levels, and enhancing grain quality management through automated sorting and quality control processes.\n\n\"AI can be particularly useful in optimizing operational efficiency and enhancing decision-making processes in grain storage and handling,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, AI algorithms can analyze historical data to predict market trends, optimize inventory management, and minimize waste. Additionally, AI-powered monitoring systems can detect anomalies in grain storage conditions in real-time, enabling proactive interventions to prevent spoilage and ensure grain quality.\"\n\nIn addition to quality and hazards sensors, Celeghini sees optimization of space as particularly impactful for efficient operations.\n\n\"AI algorithms can analyze years of historical data on grain inflow and outflow to create intelligent storage allocation plans,\" he said. \"This ensures that every cubic meter of storage space is utilized effectively, eliminating inefficiencies and minimizing the energy wasted on maintaining empty silos and ensuring first-in/first-out approach.\"\n\nCarr said AI holds tremendous potential to transform various aspects of the grain storage and handling industry. Some potential areas where he said AI could contribute include predictive maintenance to minimize equipment downtime and reduce maintenance costs; optimization of inventory management to prevent overstocking or shortages; real-time monitoring of grain storage conditions to prevent spoilage and ensure quality; automated grading and sorting of grains based on quality parameters; data-driven decision-making to optimize logistics, pricing, and market strategies.\n\n\"AI has the power to revolutionize how grain storage and handling operations are managed, leading to greater efficiency, sustainability and profitability,\" Carr said.\n\nIn an article Maier wrote for World Grain in 2019, he posited several prescient questions about technology for corporate and cooperative grain handling companies that apply as well to AI: How rapidly can they prepare for innovative technologies to remain competitive? How many employees will be needed to operate their facilities going forward? What knowledge and skills will future employees need? What continuing education and training will employees need?\n\n\"If I'm a cooperative with 45 locations, how can I optimize my system?\" Maier said. \"Generative AI in the future will help make those types of strategic decisions, hopefully more objectively or at least provide recommendations that are objective, and boards and executives will have to then make decisions based on those recommendations. And they can run a lot more what-ifs in there as well.\"\n\nWhere Maier sees AI potentially useful in the most human sense is as an interactive repository of knowledge gained by longtime employees that could be accessed by newer workers with questions about how to approach a problem. Perhaps AI could even interpret all that gained knowledge and personal experience in new ways that become more useful.\n\n\"In the end, we're still producing food, fuel and fiber that is going to come from a field that's going to have to be aggregated someplace, that will have to be processed in whatever form it needs to be for utilization,\" Maier said. \"These are supply chain physical processes that we, hopefully, can do in the future smarter and more efficiently, but the physical processes still have to happen.\"\n\nAdve said advances in generative AI already are proving their worth throughout the agriculture value chain, but particularly at the farm level where advisory services traditionally obtained from an extension office can be provided at a fraction of the cost; visual data that can be analyzed by AI to provide solutions for pests or disease in the field; and data-driven decision making by generative AI that will become a lot more sophisticated in the years ahead. Many of these advances will be especially helpful in less-developed regions that may lack reliable support infrastructure.\n\n\"Even if a tool is capable of doing an automatic answer, I think it's much more effective if there's a human in the loop making decisions on how to take advantage of that or how to apply it,\" Adve said. \"I think we add to human capabilities by incorporating generative AI tools and many other AI tools as well, and that is really by far the most effective way to take advantage of this.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs with any technology, Carr said there are several factors to consider when AI enters the conversation on a farm or at a commercial elevator.\n\n\"Firstly, they should assess their current operational challenges and determine whether AI solutions can address these effectively,\" he said. \"Secondly, they should evaluate the cost-benefit analysis, considering factors such as potential cost savings, improved efficiency, and competitive advantages. Thirdly, they should assess their readiness in terms of infrastructure, workforce capabilities, and organizational culture to embrace technological change. Ultimately, the decision to adopt AI should be driven by a strategic vision for long-term growth and sustainability.\"\n\nCESCO's Celeghini said there's a general interest among customers, with some companies embracing AI as a marketing tool. However, full integration into existing systems and equipment is just getting started.\n\n\"One hurdle is the complexity of AI implementation in settings like grain storage plants, which typically rely on straightforward automation,\" he said. \"Customized training for each project adds cost that may not always justify the benefits. Instead, focusing on specific AI applications like online quality analysis or predictive maintenance could yield more feasible solutions, independent of plant specifics.\"\n\nMaier said it was the construction of the Kent Feed Mill and Grain Science Complex at Iowa State that provided a refreshing perspective on technology. The importance of people with specialized skills who can build a facility and implement new technologies such as AI will not diminish, he said.\n\n\"We need people with those types of hands-on, specialized technical skills, and that, too, will continue in our plant when it comes to maintenance,\" he said. \"People probably will need to have a higher knowledge because of the types of systems that our plants will use in terms of automation. You've got to understand not just the wiring, but also how all that relates to the PLC (programmable logical controller) and how all of it ties into the automation system. That's not going to get replaced by AI at all.\"\n\nAdve said adoption of AI in agriculture could be slowed by a lack of expertise. Ag companies understand the problem and understand their customers but may not have the AI proficiency in-house to develop AI-based products and services. To address this shortage, the Center for Digital Agriculture, in collaboration with the University of Illinois' highly respected departments of Agriculture and Biological Engineering, Crop Sciences and Computer Science has developed the first asynchronous online Master of Engineering in Digital Agriculture degree and professional certificat programs.\n\n\"We think it can be valuable in expanding the workforce with kids coming out of school today and the existing workforce, because there is a vast workforce in agriculture and ag tech companies that would benefit from this training,\" Adve said. \"They already have strong ag experience and understanding of the markets and the customer needs, so giving the training they need in a couple of AI topics would be able to start working on products that could have a greater impact in the near term.\"\n\nSafeGrain's Carr emphasized the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing within the industry to harness the full potential of AI and other emerging technologies. Addressing concerns about cybersecurity and data privacy is paramount, especially given the sensitive nature of operational data. Additionally, the lack of sufficient technology infrastructure in rural or less-developed areas may pose challenges in terms of connectivity and access to AI-enabled solutions. Moreover, there may be resistance to change and a need for workforce training to ensure seamless integration and utilization of AI technologies, he said.", "source": {"uri": "world-grain.com",

Additionally, these solutions address critical societal issues like healthcare access and climate change mitigation.\n\nAI and automation will radically transform work and the workplace as they develop further. Machines will increasingly perform tasks traditionally done by humans, augmenting or even surpassing their capabilities. This leads to job loss for some, job growth for others, and significant alterations across different occupations and professions.\n\nThough automation and AI will likely create enough work for all, society must manage large workforce transitions and potential dislocations effectively.\n\nWorkers will need new skills as they adapt to working alongside advanced machines. Often, this means moving into different roles or occupations. Meeting these challenges head-on is essential for realizing the full benefits of automation and AI.\n\nIn this article, we will explore how automation and Generative AI development services influence people and communities. We will also see how this technology will create opportunities for businesses.\n\nAutomation has an expansive history that begins with the Industrial Revolution when machinery began replacing manual labor. Major milestones include assembly lines reforming manufacturing and computerized systems easing complex processes.\n\nAI has witnessed massive strides over recent years. Industries are transforming because of technologies like natural language processing, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAI's capabilities have become exponentially stronger over time allowing it to perform tasks that require human perception, reasoning, and decision-making processes. These tasks include analyzing hefty data leading to informed business decisions, personalized customer experiences, and advanced healthcare or finance solutions.\n\nAs AI becomes ever more integral to daily life, its use in society grows ever deeper. Generative AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 demonstrate its capacity for producing text, images, and even art that appear human-like. This in turn revolutionizes how content production and consumption occurs. AI not only increases efficiency and productivity; its evolution brings both excitement and uncertainty about work life as a whole.\n\nAI technology and automation enable workers to focus more creatively on complex activities that promote innovation and growth. Thus, increasing both their productivity as well as efficiency. This gives human workers more time and freedom for innovative activities while supporting growth initiatives.\n\nWhile certain positions become redundant, new employment opportunities exist within AI development and maintenance fields. The demand rises for professionals with expertise in AI/automation - creating more career paths to explore than ever.\n\nAutomation can take on dangerous tasks to reduce injury risks and enhance workplace safety. This is particularly important in industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing.\n\nAs machines take on routine tasks. People gain more time for personal development, leisure activities, and exploring passions. This possibly leads to improved work-life balance and well-being for everyone involved.\n\nAI applications in healthcare can create more accurate diagnoses, customized treatment plans, and enhanced patient outcomes. This way the technology is greatly expanding medical science and helping in improving patient care.\n\nAI can optimize energy use, more effectively utilize resources, and support the creation of eco-friendly technologies - thus contributing to environmental preservation.\n\nAI-powered systems can offer customized recommendations and quicker services, increasing customer satisfaction while fuelling business success.\n\nJob displacement and the necessity for retraining can result in demographic changes. This happens as individuals relocate to regions with more favorable employment opportunities. This can change community dynamics and strain resources in both departing and arriving locations.\n\nIt is a fact that the demand for highly skilled workers is increasing day by day. At the same time, those lacking these capabilities may fall further behind. So, this will increase the income inequality gap further.\n\nAI systems may increase existing biases within their training data unintentionally. This can lead to biased acts like hiring, lending, and law enforcement practices.\n\nJob displacement can have severe psychological side effects, including stress, depression, and decreased self-esteem.\n\nAutomation can bring economic gains in some sectors while creating downturns elsewhere. Communities that adapt and retrain their workforce could experience economic success while others could face serious hardships.\n\nJob displacement and the necessity of retraining can cause demographic shifts as people migrate toward areas offering better job prospects, changing community dynamics, and straining resources in both departing and arriving locations. This has the potential to alter community relationships significantly as resources must now serve both sets of residents.\n\nChanges in employment patterns and the state of the economy can have an impact on social harmony. There is a possibility that communities will face difficulties in preserving social links. It will also be difficult for them to assist those impacted by automation.\n\nPreparing communities for tomorrow requires investing in educational and training programs. The courses help citizens get the necessary skills for living in an automated society, with lifelong learning and adaptability.\n\nAddressing the impact of automation and AI on people and communities is crucial. Since they continue to have an impact on different areas of life. Real-world AI applications and ethical considerations will make the future better and more fruitful. Let's see what we can do to make this journey helpful:\n\nTo address employment dislocation and skills gaps, it is important to implement thoughtful policy initiatives. This involves providing social safety nets, retraining programs, and encouraging companies to embrace ethical behavior.\n\nIt is important to ensure that AI is created and utilized ethically. This entails developing transparent, fair, and responsible systems that eliminate biases while protecting user privacy.\n\nIt is essential for navigating the difficulties and possibilities posed by automation and AI. Collaborative efforts, including those of AI development companies and consultancy organizations, can result in more inclusive and sustainable solutions.\n\nUltimately, the objective is for automation and AI to complement rather than replace human talents. We can make our society more rich and equitable by using technology to boost human potential.\n\nThe future success of AI depends upon ethical development and industry regulations. The standards that adhere to human values, and foster transparency and collaboration. These are some of the key ingredients necessary to maintaining public trust in this technology. While its implementation costs can be prohibitively high, its potential to boost productivity, and creativity, and address environmental concerns is unquestionable.\n\nDebut Infotech is one of the leading AI development companies offering AI consulting and AI development services. They demonstrate their dedication to the responsible evolution of the tech. Their dedication ensures AI benefits both society and workplaces alike.\n\nAI can significantly transform our lives when used ethically and sustainably.

He discusses the ongoing challenges utilities face, as well as how the rapid evolution of AI, cloud adoption, and data integration tools are redefining the utility landscape. This interview provides a comprehensive overview of the current and future tech trends in the utility sector and offers practical advice for those looking to leverage modern technologies.\n\nAnd don't let the conversation end there: if you have follow-up questions or notes for Pat, leave them in the comments below to keep the discussion going!\n\nMatt Chester: Pat, five years ago you wrote to the Energy Central community about tech trends to embrace. This interview is a great opportunity to look back on that, where you highlighted the trends: \"1. Data is the Greatest Informant, 2. Details Matter, 3. Cross-Platform Applications, 4. Interacting with Information, and 5. Machine Learning.\" As you re-read these forecasts, which of your points do you think rang the most true over the past five years?\n\nPat Hohl: Reflecting on my predictions from five years ago, I see that many of my observations have held true, but the landscape has also evolved significantly. Data has indeed become central to decision-making for utilities and in all aspects of our lives -- from choosing restaurants to planning travel routes and selecting TV shows.\n\nAmong the trends I discussed, AI and machine learning have been particularly transformative. In the past couple of years, AI has gained massive attention, especially with the advent of large language models like ChatGPT. This explosion of AI interest is evident at industry events where data and AI are hot topics.\n\nA notable challenge for utilities has been the so-called 'junk drawer' problem -- amassing vast amounts of data but struggling to utilize it effectively. Over the past five years, the focus on integrating and improving data quality has intensified. Tools have advanced, enabling 'citizen developers' to create useful applications without heavy reliance on IT specialists. This shift has democratized data usage, making it more accessible to non-experts.\n\nCloud adoption and AI advancements have emphasized the importance of data governance and real-time data integration. Modern tools now ensure data quality at the point of entry, reducing delays and enhancing utility operations. This progress paves the way for incorporating diverse data sources and leveraging real-time insights, offering new possibilities for the energy sector.\n\nMC: On the other hand, are there any aspects of what you wrote that you wish you could have a redo of because they didn't quite turn out as you thought?\n\nPH: Looking back, I don't have specific points I'd want to redo necessary, but there are certainly evolving challenges and nuances that weren't fully anticipated when I originally wrote that piece. The utility sector now faces greater demands to be environmentally and socially responsible, requiring us to consider demographics and community impacts in our operations.\n\nOne notable development is the impact of the Infrastructure JOBS Act, which aims to electrify our society - transportation, school buses, and trucking centers -- some anticipating the power demand of a small city. This shift requires utilities to integrate diverse data sources into their planning processes to build and manage a future grid that accommodates these new demands.\n\nUtilities are also grappling with the need to rebuild significant portions of their aging infrastructure within the next two decades. Planning this transformation is complex because we can't predict all future technologies. This uncertainty necessitates a flexible, data-driven approach, potentially involving still-evolving automation and AI.\n\nWhile I highlighted machine learning in my earlier article, AI's broader applications -- like large language models -- have, of course, gained prominence. These advancements bring opportunities, but they also bring challenges, such as increased energy consumption for data centers. Thus, the utility sector must balance the potential benefits of AI with its energy demands, navigating a path toward a more sustainable and efficient future.\n\nSo, while my initial predictions were largely on point, the rapid evolution of AI and the expanding role of utilities in addressing broader societal issues were areas that evolved more dramatically than I anticipated.\n\nMC: An interesting note to your article was also that you cautioned against people taking too much from the idea that AI will take over utility jobs. Did you foresee the type of AI explosion that we've seen this past year or two when you wrote this, and would you change any of your advice or forecasts knowing what you know now?\n\nPH: When I wrote my article, I cautioned against expecting AI to take over all utility jobs. The heart of my advice remains relevant today: careers focused on rote tasks like data entry are at risk, but this shift towards AI also allows workers to engage in more creative, higher-value activities.\n\nAI has indeed advanced significantly, automating many routine tasks. However, this automation should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat. It enables employees to focus on problem-solving and innovation, skills we desperately need to tackle the challenges we face. As a tool, AI can elevate our capabilities and value in the business world.\n\nLarge language models, like ChatGPT, have gained substantial attention. They're powerful but not infallible, requiring human oversight. These models are non-deterministic, meaning their decision-making processes are not always transparent. This ambiguity necessitates human judgment to ensure AI's outputs are sensible and reliable.\n\nThere are amusing instances, such as AI providing nonsensical answers due to its broad training data. One example I saw was someone asking when the first cow was put on the moon, and ChatGPT provided an apparently definitive but obviously incorrect answer. This highlights the importance of a human in the loop to verify AI's outputs. AI should be viewed as a tool that, when used correctly, can sift through vast information and extract valuable insights. Within GIS, AI machine learning is superb at finding patterns in data.\n\nGenerative AI will prove to be an advantageous assistant. One fascinating development I heard about is the concept of virtual teammates. These AI assistants could join meetings, summarize discussions, do research, and highlight key points. This innovation shows the potential of AI to enhance productivity and collaboration in the workplace in a positive, enhancing way.\n\nMC: If we were to fast forward five years from now, what tech trends and forecasts taking place today do you think will be the ones most likely to come to fruition? And in which areas are people going to be wrong in retrospect?\n\nPH: In looking five years into the future, I believe the importance of details, especially in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), will continue to grow. GIS is evolving beyond record-keeping and map-making to integrate many concerns, from physical and environmental impacts to customer effects. This integration will be crucial as utilities handle increasingly complex data to make informed decisions.\n\nThe trend toward relying heavily on data for decision-making will persist. In the past, operations often depended on individuals' experience and mental estimates. Now, and increasingly in the future, data analysis will underpin operational decisions, necessitating continuous improvement and expansion of data quality and scope.\n\nHowever, the particulars of analytics remain less clear. The field of data science has already transformed significantly in the past five years, and it's uncertain how it will evolve next. Tools like AI and machine learning will continue to advance, but their specific applications and impacts are still unfolding. These technologies require robust data to function, whether they're addressing environmental impact, sustainability, renewable integration, or vehicle electrification.\n\nEmerging systems will need accurate and current data about the network itself -- poles, wires, transformers, and electricity flow. The emphasis will be on enhancing the underlying data models so that systems can operate more automatically and in real time. This approach will allow optimized decision-making about the grid's operation, from long-term planning to immediate responses.\n\nMC: As the industry continues to evolve, what advice would you offer to utility professionals seeking to leverage modern technologies to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in the market?\n\nPH: To stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in the evolving utility industry, my first piece of advice is to prioritize continuous learning. Engaging in ongoing training and staying informed through resources like Energy Central is crucial. Utilize the wide array of learning formats available today, including short videos, podcasts, MOOCs,and ebooks. The pace of change in our industry requires us to stay updated more frequently than ever before.\n\nReading extensively is another key strategy -- leaders are readers. Keeping up with the latest industry trends, technologies, and thought leadership will help you understand where the industry is headed and how to position yourself and your organization to take advantage of emerging opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, we're not just experiencing an energy transition; we're also in the midst of a workforce transition. The new generation of workers grew up with digital technology and expects seamless, tech-driven experiences. Embrace technologies like digital twins and immersive simulations for training and operational planning. These tools enhance safety and efficiency by allowing workers to interact with virtual environments before encountering real-world scenarios.\n\nThanks to Pat for joining me for this interview and for providing a wealth of insights and expertise to the Energy Central Community.

Threat intelligence, vulnerability management, asset tracking, identity management, budgeting, third-party risk -- and that's just what the company is willing to put in the job description.\n\nTo be a cybersecurity expert is to spend your entire career deepening your well of knowledge in one or a few domains. To be a cybersecurity leader, on the other hand, is to spend your career attempting to drink an ocean through a straw. What makes this moment in cybersecurity so interesting is that generative artificial intelligence (AI) brought a fundamental change to both the ocean and the straw.\n\nTools are integrating AI to improve enrichment, saving analysts substantial time by rendering various data sources into simple, natural language explanations. Engineers and operators use the various co-pilots and their competitors to save research time and rapidly create boilerplate code. Managers are deputizing chat tools to create reports and dashboards. Meanwhile, attackers are leveraging AI tools to perform astonishing, high-profile attacks, carting away millions of dollars using technology that was the sole purview of mediocre sci-fi only a decade ago.\n\nUnmasking the AI Menace: Social Engineering Redux\n\nPicture this: An email pops into your inbox from your boss requesting that you remit payment on a massive, secret invoice. You obviously feel deeply uncertain and follow your latest phishing training by video-calling your manager. On that call, your manager and a crowd of other senior leaders tell you it's a legitimate request and that a major partnership will collapse if it isn't fulfilled immediately. You pay as fast as your fingers can fly before logging out, secure in the knowledge that you just saved the day. The next morning, you get a call from your company's lawyer informing you that you just paid millions of dollars to a hacker.\n\nWelcome to the current state of AI-fueled social engineering where the lines between truth and deception blur effortlessly and following the old rules can result in new catastrophes.\n\nThis story isn't as far-fetched as it may sound. Last year, a finance worker at a multinational firm in Hong Kong paid out more than $25 million U.S. dollars under almost exactly those circumstances. While many of the fears around AI are dramatically overblown, this is one area where generative AI represents a sea-change in attacker capacity.\n\nWhile solving this problem is a complex task, one useful procedural shift is establishing passphrases or other verbal challenges that employees must use to verify identity during sensitive calls. For example, asking for three points of identifying information. This sort of out-of-band control can be easily employed by almost anyone quickly. Similar techniques are popular in password reset processes and have also been tremendously effective.\n\nNow that we've talked about a terribly realistic nightmare scenario, let's dispel a couple of myths.\n\nDemystifying AI Hacks: Separating Fact from Fiction\n\nContrary to Hollywood portrayals, most threat actors aren't employing super-advanced AI to breach systems and steal data with bespoke zero-day attacks and custom Command and Control (C2) protocols. It isn't that such technology is impossible but that the necessary resources to build it are absurd and available only to nation-states and a tiny handful of corporate powers, a group I often collectively reference as \"The Big Kids.\" Put simply, if I have what I need to create a custom AI just for hacking, then I already have people capable of doing everything that AI can do and much, much more.\n\nThis isn't to say that AI has no utility to attackers outside of social engineering. By integrating AI into existing hacking techniques, attackers lower the barrier to entry, making vulnerabilities once deemed obscure now fair game. The democratization of hacking tools forces us to look at once-impotent attackers as suddenly serious threats. Everything and anything an attacker can Google becomes a potential target and now they have a helpful chatbot to explain how to pursue that target, step-by-step.\n\nInterestingly, from the perspective of a security analyst or incident responder, this sudden wave of attacks against what once were mid-tier vulnerabilities is essentially a volume problem (as opposed to a sophistication problem). This is interesting because, as I alluded to earlier, AI is uniquely useful for solving volume problems. In other words, this is a case where the poison is its own antidote. AI-powered solutions can analyze vast amounts of network traffic in real time, identifying potential threats before they escalate and providing critical context to improve and speed investigations. Whether it's using AI to create queries from natural language, develop dashboards or find insights in highly structured technical data, these tools reduce analyst fatigue, decrease Mean-Time-to-Resolution and improve quality standardization without additional work, each of which is a key component to volume-based solutions.\n\nThe Myth of AI Data Poisoning: Think Horses, Not Zebras\n\nWithin the buzz surrounding AI, another myth persists: The notion that attackers specifically target AI training data for poisoning. Sensationalist headlines aside, this approach remains largely impractical for the average cybercriminal.\n\nWhile nation-state actors may harbor interest in manipulating AI models, the lack of clear incentives will deter most attackers, as will the immense technical and logistical difficulty of performing such an attack. That isn't to say that training data is free of risk. Anyone who has spent the last decade responding to ransomware can tell you that vulnerable data is a valuable target. The more important the data, the more likely it is to be targeted, and training data is often a key value proposition for multibillion-dollar companies. While we should be attentive to the possibility of poisoning, it is a significantly less pressing concern than theft or access denial.\n\nWhy is this distinction worthwhile? First, solving data poisoning is primarily an algorithmic challenge. The solution lies in developing AI tools that are more resistant to bad inputs. On the other hand, solving traditional extortion tactics like theft and denial is primarily a data protection challenge. The solution then lies in implementing best practices, developing effective controls, and rapidly resolving issues as they emerge. Second, data poisoning envisions training data risk as being the result of its outputs, whereas theft and denial envision training data risk as being the result of its storage. The former requires a team of PhDs to understand and solve, the latter requires a few mid-tier security architects and a good project manager.\n\nSecurity Tomorrow: What We Can Do Today\n\nWith debunking myths and keeping current realities in mind, organizations must take practical, actionable next steps to secure their people, processes and technology. Bolstering employee defenses against social engineering is priority number one and organizations should emphasize continuous security awareness training as a key component of that process.\n\nSecondly, AI risk is fundamentally a form of third-party risk. The challenge of managing that risk then remains to understand the problem statements, technical theses, visible and hidden risks, and then incorporating all of that into planning and decision-making. Businesses must evaluate AI tools based on rational bases to determine product fit based on dispassionate analysis, not on hype.\n\nNo risk is unacceptable so long as it is appropriately addressed. However, unaddressed risk is never acceptable.\n\nThe fusion of AI and sophisticated threat techniques presents both challenges and opportunities.

He replaces Bill Richter, who is stepping down as CEO.\n\nIn an interview with SiliconANGLE and theCUBE Research team, Gourlay outlined his rationale for joining the company. He cited Qumulo's strong team, commitment to customer-centric innovation, and potential for capturing emerging market dynamics as compelling factors in his decision. \"The parallels between Qumulo and my previous experiences are striking,\" Gourlay said. \"There is a shared commitment to quality and an innovative spirit that positions Qumulo well for future growth.\"\n\nAccording to theCUBE Research analyst Rob Strechay, rethinking storage and networking in supporting AI and machine learning workloads will play a pivotal role of generative AI in transforming data centers. All enterprises are emphasizing the need for high-capacity, cost-effective storage that can handle diverse I/O patterns across different stages of data processing.\n\n\"The addition of a product-led CEO like Doug to lead Qumulo into the next act, where unstructured data is the lifeblood of AI, makes a ton of sense,\" said Strechay. \"His focus and attention to detail on the product and execution sides will be key to Qumulo bringing software-defined storage services to the AI.\"\n\nAccording to Gourlay, applied AI is a significant growth category. \"The market for AI training infrastructure is well-served by existing players,\" Gourlay said. \"There is a larger, more sustainable market in helping enterprises integrate AI capabilities with their existing data one that doesn't compromise data security or integrity.\"\n\nThe future of gen AI data centers lies in the seamless integration of advanced storage and networking solutions. Gourlay emphasized the need to move beyond traditional network-attached storage solutions. He advocates for a shift toward network-integrated systems that better serve the needs of modern, distributed computing environments. Gourlay hopes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data management and utilization, aligning with the broader trends of digital transformation.\n\nAI and machine learning have reached a pivotal point, significantly influencing the design and operation of modern data centers. Generative AI represents a major leap forward, requiring substantial infrastructure support in terms of computing power, networking and storage.\n\nTheCUBE Research networking industry analyst Bob LaLiberte thinks that data centers will undergo a quick modernization and networking and storage to evolve fast to meet the generative AI needs of new enterprise apps. \"Modern IT environments and workflows are highly distributed and complex, so the ability to unify and connect to a single data platform across clouds, data centers and edge locations can drive significant operational efficiencies and accelerate AI initiatives,\" he said.\n\nGourlay's vision for Qumulo includes leveraging a cloud-native implementation and a global namespace to manage the rapid growth of enterprise data.\n\n\"We are seeing a renewed and critical importance of viewing data as the most important business asset that requires efficient scalable storage, reliable data access and thoughtful management for this next generative AI wave for the enterprise,\" he said. \"Data growth is accelerating faster than ever before, driven by advances in AI and the increasing digitization of business processes. Qumulo is uniquely positioned to meet these challenges with innovative solutions that prioritize reliability, durability and quality.\"\n\nGourlay's appointment marks a significant milestone for Qumulo as it seeks to enhance its position in the technology leadership to reshape the new emerging systems architecture in what is a very competitive data storage market. The unique focus on applied AI and network integration will be a big bet for Qumulo to ignite the company's growth and innovation in the coming years.\n\n\"Collaborative efforts between storage and networking providers, exemplified by the evolving role of the big public cloud provider, new compute architectures and the partnerships between storage and network providers, will be crucial in driving this evolution and setting industry benchmarks for optimized AI infrastructure,\" said Strechay.\n\nAs Qumulo navigates this next phase, its customers and competitors will be watching closely to see how Gourlay's vision translates into creating a sustainable durable business model for the company.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumulo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qumulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arista Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software-defined storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distributed computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Network-attached storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digitization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Systems architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Outsourcing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Outsourcing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/07/doubgourlay.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

From the advent of personal computers in the 1970s to the introduction of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, followed by the emergence of smartphones, social media, and cloud computing in the 2000s, recent decades have seen significant shifts in how we work. And now, in the 2020s, the latest transformational force appears to be artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe field of AI research dates to the 1950s but has blossomed in recent years. Machine learning algorithms are now integrated into various products and services, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and self-driving vehicles. Recently, the development of generative AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini has enabled users to interact with sophisticated chatbots and generate text or images based on prompts. For many, these innovations have shifted AI from a science fiction concept to a practical tool for work and creative pursuits.\n\nGlobal Growth in Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe number of AI patent filings has increased exponentially in recent years\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Center for Security and Emerging Technology data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nBeyond the well-known products and media attention, progress in AI is further demonstrated by the surge in research and development. According to Stanford University's 2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report, AI-related patent filings have increased exponentially, from approximately 3,500 in 2010 to over 190,000 in 2022. Similarly, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled over the same period, rising from around 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 by 2022.\n\nThis extensive research has led to rapid improvements in AI performance across various competencies. For example, the most advanced AI systems now outperform humans in image, language, handwriting, and speech recognition, as well as language understanding and reading comprehension. As of last year, these models nearly matched human performance on predictive reasoning tests, heightening concerns about the potential impact of AI on the workforce.\n\nAI Exposure & Automation Risk by Occupation\n\nNearly 9% of workers have high AI exposure & high automation risk\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013) data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nWith the proliferation of AI-related research and new AI-enabled technologies, computers now have the potential to disrupt many industries and occupations previously believed to be insulated from automation. Historically, jobs at the highest risk of computerized automation involved repetitive, low-complexity tasks, such as those performed by assembly line workers or farm laborers. However, the range of workers at risk of job displacement has now broadened.\n\nOne useful way to understand AI's impact on the labor force is to classify occupations based on their degree of AI exposure -- how integral AI is predicted to be in their field -- and the probability of computerized automation. For instance, professions like lawyers, CEOs, and civil engineers might rely on AI to enhance decision-making but face low probabilities of being completely automated. These high-AI-exposure, low-automation-risk professions make up an estimated 16% of the U.S. workforce.\n\nConversely, occupations with both high AI exposure and high risk of automation include loan officers, accountants, and paralegals, whose tasks and knowledge can be more easily learned and replicated by AI systems. These roles account for an estimated 9% of all workers nationally.\n\nThe majority of occupations, about 75% of total employment, are unlikely to be significantly impacted by AI but may face other types of automation risks. Jobs such as farm laborers or fast food cooks can be automated using non-AI-based computerized machines. Workers who face both low AI exposure and low risk of automation include highly hands-on professionals like dancers, firefighters, and plumbers.\n\nAI Job Displacement by Location\n\nCompared to other types of automation, AI will have a greater impact on high-income workers\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013), Bureau of Labor Statistics data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nThe trend toward computerized automation has historically made lower-income jobs more vulnerable to displacement, but AI changes that dynamic. AI-related automation shows a loose positive correlation with income, suggesting that higher earners may now face greater risk.\n\nDue to the distribution of industries and jobs across the country, AI-driven job displacement is likely to impact some areas more than others. In five states -- South Dakota, Kansas, Delaware, Florida, and New York -- more than one in ten workers are vulnerable to AI-related automation, facing both high levels of AI exposure and high probabilities of automation. These states have high concentrations of workers in the knowledge sector. Conversely, states like Indiana, Arkansas, and Nevada, where the workforce is more concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing, or service professions, face a lower risk of AI-driven automation. However, general automation could still impact up to half of the workforce in these areas.\n\nAmong major metropolitan areas with populations of one million or more, locations in Florida and New York account for four of the top five regions at greatest risk of AI job displacement. These include Tampa, Miami, Jacksonville, and Buffalo, which have higher concentrations of workers in sectors susceptible to AI automation. In contrast, the two major metros facing the lowest risk of AI-related job loss are both in California: Riverside and San Jose.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by (un)Common Logic, a data-driven digital marketing agency, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources. To determine the locations with the most workers at risk of AI-related job displacement, researchers calculated the percentage of workers in occupations that have both high AI exposure and high probabilities of computerization. For the purpose of this analysis, high AI exposure was defined as being at least one standard deviation above the mean and high probability of computerization was defined as being 70% or more.\n\nHere is a summary of the data for Missouri:\n\nShare of workers at risk of AI-related automation: 8.9% Total workers at risk of AI-related automation: 256,272Share of workers at risk of any computerized automation: 45.5%Total workers at risk of any computerized automation: 1,309,334Median annual wage: $45,080\n\nFor reference, here are the statistics for the entire United States:\n\nShare of workers at risk of AI-related automation: 8.9%Total workers at risk of AI-related automation: 13,469,438Share of workers at risk of any computerized automation: 43.9%Total workers at risk of any computerized automation: 66,695,676Median annual wage: $48,060\n\nFor more information, a detailed methodology, and complete results, see Cities With the Most Workers at Risk of AI Job Displacement on (un)Common

The rapid pace of adoption is unlike anything we've experienced before, and it could end up being more influential than the arrival of the PC, the internet, social media, mobile, and cloud technology transitions that preceded it.\n\nAccording to our recent global study of more than 2,200 professionals working in the fields of law, tax, accounting, risk, compliance, and other knowledge fields, there's a tremendous sense of excitement about the here-and-now and future potential of generative AI to improve their work -- not to mention their work-life balance.\n\nProfessionals now have a better sense of how AI will affect their work -- and in some cases, it already is. Our second annual Future of Professionals survey found that 63% of the people we polled have already used gen AI in their day-to-day work to draft documents, summarize information, and perform basic research. Notably, more than three-quarters of the professionals surveyed consider AI a force for good -- and that's true across different geographies and professions. Respondents predicted that more than half of professional work will use AI-powered technology in five years.\n\nThe most commonly predicted benefits of new AI-powered technologies include the greater value it will bring to their work (38% of respondents), increased efficiency and productivity (26%), and freed-up time (28%). This overall positive sentiment around AI may be all the more significant because it provides a measurable counter-narrative to the doom-and-gloom predictions that this technology will destroy jobs. In fact, only 10% of respondents were concerned about widespread job losses in their industry.\n\nIt's not the first time that the workplace has seen tech-driven transformations. I think about my grandmother, who was one of the first women in Australia to work in a bank and spent her days manually adding columns of data by hand. Personal computers and spreadsheet software made calculating data by hand obsolete, but it didn't end the profession of accounting.\n\nSimilarly, AI has the potential to automate labor-intensive or routine tasks to transform the way professional work is done and make a career in these fields more appealing. Professionals predict that work will be more fulfilling with less time spent on the type of tasks that AI could most easily address.\n\nNearly 60% of respondents want to see their profession focus on a better work-life balance in the future, while 42% would like to spend more time on engaging, creative work. In short, professional careers could become more appealing. Such changes could be particularly significant in the U.S. accounting industry, which in recent years has had trouble attracting young people to the field.\n\nBy automating the most routine tasks, our report shows that professionals predict AI could free up as much as four hours a week in the next year. What will they do with 200 extra hours of time a year? Maybe they'll have more time to spend on their non-work lives. Or they might reinvest some of that time in more strategic work, innovation, and professional development.\n\nFor U.S. lawyers alone, that would represent a collective 266 million hours of increased productivity. That's the equivalent of adding an additional colleague for every 10 already on a team. It translates to more than $100,000 in new, billable time per lawyer each year, based on current average rates, with similar value and productivity gains projected across various professions.\n\nIn five years, our respondents predicted, the time savings could amount to 12 hours a week, more than 620 hours a year. Imagine the broader impact on the economy and GDP from this increased efficiency.\n\nOf course, change naturally makes some people nervous -- and for good reason. The top concern among professionals is that people will rely too much on AI-powered technology rather than using their professional judgment. Many also worry about the accuracy of gen AI results, which is why almost two-thirds of respondents said a human's involvement in the loop is crucial for responsible use.\n\nWe can also expect bad actors to try to wield new technology in nefarious ways. Two-thirds of respondents cited data security as a concern.\n\nGovernment workers were the most concerned about the use of AI in their sector. And the vast majority of professionals in the legal and tax sectors indicated that allowing AI to represent clients in court or make final decisions would be a step too far.\n\nConcerns around ethics and oversight only heighten the imperative that we as a tech community build AI applications responsibly and ethically. Because there are not yet generally agreed-upon ethics around gen AI, there have been controversies surrounding its use, such as the collection of personal and copyrighted data from online sources to build large language models.\n\nThe future of AI is not predestined -- it is ours to shape. We welcome the collaboration of the broader tech community in responsibly pushing innovation forward while embracing the benefits this transformative technology can bring.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spreadsheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2098188879-e1720610380503.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The law's primary focus is regulating and limiting \"algorithmic discrimination,\" defined as using an AI system to discriminate based on a class protected under either Colorado or federal law.[2] Related are \"consequential decision[s],\" which are decisions that have material legal or otherwise significant effects on consumers stemming from a denial of: education enrollment or opportunity; employment or employment opportunity; financial or lending services; essential government services; healthcare services; housing; insurance; or a legal service.[3] AI systems that make or assist in making consequential decisions are deemed \"high-risk.\"[4]\n\nThe law regulates two groups: those that deploy AI systems (\"deployers\")[5] and those that develop or intentionally and substantially modify AI systems (\"developers\").[6] Both deployers and developers are charged with a duty of reasonable care to protect consumers from \"known or reasonably foreseeable\" risks of algorithmic discrimination by high-risk AI systems.[7] Deployers and developers who meet their obligations for high-risk AI are presumed to have upheld their duty. Each group has their own obligations.\n\nDeployers' Obligations\n\nDeployers have several requirements to satisfy their obligations for high-risk systems. First, deployers must implement an AI risk management policy that addresses the principles, processes, and personnel that the deployer uses to identify, document, and mitigate known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.[8] Additionally, the policy must be reasonable in light of: (1) the deployer's size and complexity; (2) the nature and scope of the AI system, including its intended use; (3) the sensitivity and amount of data processed by the AI system when deployed; and (4) guidance provided by either the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, ISO/IEC 42001, or an equally stringent framework that is \"nationally or internationally recognized.\" The risk management policy designed by the deployer can be used for multiple of the deployer's AI systems; a policy per AI system is not necessarily required.[9]\n\nSecond, deployers or third-party contractors must conduct impact assessments based on information \"reasonably known by or available to the deployer.\"[10] An impact assessment must at least include: (1) a statement by the deployer about the AI's (a) purpose, (b) intended uses, (c) deployment context, and (d) benefits; (2) a determination about whether deploying the AI poses known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination, and if so, how the AI might discriminate and the steps taken to mitigate this risk; (3) a description of the categories of data processed as inputs by the AI and what the outputs of the AI are; (4) the metrics used to evaluate the AI's performance; (5) known limitations of the AI system; (6) an overview of any measures taken to improve transparency to consumers, including any measures taken to tell consumers when the AI is being used; and (7) an overview of the post-deployment monitoring used and user safeguards implemented, including how issues stemming from deploying the AI are handled.[11] Additionally, deployers that customize the AI model with additional data, such as through fine-tuning or using retrieval-augmented generation, must provide an overview of the categories of data used.[12]\n\nA single impact assessment may be used only for a \"comparable set of [AI] systems\" that have been deployed.[13] An initial impact assessment must be completed when the AI system is deployed and at least annually thereafter.[14] An impact assessment must also be completed within 90 days of making any intentional and substantial change to the AI system.[15] This impact assessment must also state the extent that the AI system's current usage is consistent with the developer's intended use.[16] An impact assessment conducted to comply with another law or regulation can be used to satisfy these requirements if it is \"reasonably similar in scope and effect\" to the requirements for Colorado's impact assessments.[17] Deployers must hold on to all conducted impact assessments and related records until three years after the final deployment of the AI.[18]\n\nDeployers must also start conducting annual reviews of each deployed high-risk AI system to ensure that every AI system is not engaged in algorithmic discrimination.[19] For systems already deployed, the first review must be completed by February 2026.[20]\n\nThird, a deployer must provide a clear statement on its website summarizing the types of high-risk AI systems currently deployed; how the deployer manages any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination for each deployed AI system; and a detailed description of the nature, source, and extent of information collected and used by the deployer.[21] The statement must be routinely updated.[22]\n\nFourth, deployers of high-risk AI systems involving consumers must notify consumers that an AI is being used and disclose, in plain language: the nature of the consequential decision being made; a plain-language description of the AI; instructions on how to access the summary posted on their website; and the deployer's contact information.[23] If the deployer collects consumers' personal information to make \"legal or similarly significant effects,\" the notice must also tell consumers how to exercise their state statutory right to opt out of data processing.[24]\n\nWhen an AI system makes a decision adverse to the consumer, the deployer must provide an additional notice.[25] The notice must state in plain language the reason(s) for the consequential decision, including the degree and manner that the AI contributed to the decision; the type of data used to make the decision; and the source(s) of the data used to make the decision.[26] The deployer must provide the adversely affected consumer with the ability to correct any incorrect information and allow the consumer to appeal the decision.[27]\n\nThe deployer must attempt to provide the consumer directly with any required notice in all languages the deployer does business in and in a format accessible to consumers with disabilities.[28] If the notice cannot be provided directly, the deployer must make the notice's contents available in a way \"reasonably calculated\" to inform the consumer.[29]\n\nFinally, deployers must notify the attorney general within 90 days and without unreasonable delay if they discover that a deployed AI has engaged in algorithmic discrimination.[30] The attorney general may request the deployer's risk management policy, impact assessment(s), or records to ensure the deployer complies with the law.[31]\n\nSmall-Deployer Exception\n\nSmall-scale deployers are not required to implement a risk management policy program; conduct yearly impact assessments; or publicly disclose information about the data used by the deployer or how the deployer manages known or reasonably foreseeable risks.[32] To qualify as small-scale deployer, the deployer must have less than 50 employees throughout the AI system's lifecycle.[33] However, small-scale deployers are unregulated only if: the AI is not trained on the small-scale deployer's own data; the AI must be used as intended by the AI's developer; the AI must continue to be trained based on data that is not the small-scale deployer's data; and the small-scale deployer must make any impact assessments completed by the AI's developer[34] available to consumers\n\nDevelopers' Obligations\n\nThere are five requirements for developers to meet their obligations for high-risk systems. First, developers must provide other developers and deployers of the AI system with a statement describing the reasonably foreseeable uses of the system and known harmful or inappropriate uses of the system.[35]\n\nSecond, the developer must provide documentation to developers and deployers that discloses: (1) the purpose of the AI; (2) the benefits of and intended uses of the AI; (3) known or reasonably foreseeable limitations of the AI system, such as risks of algorithmic discrimination based on the system's intended uses; (4) a high-level overview of the type of data used to train the AI system; and (5) any other information needed by deployers to complete an impact assessment.[36]\n\nThird, the developer must produce documents that describe: (1) how the AI's performance was measured and the steps taken to mitigate algorithmic discrimination prior to making the AI available; (2) how the training data was reviewed for potential biases and suitability for training; (3) the AI's intended outputs; (4) the measures taken to mitigate known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination; (5) how the AI should and should not be used; (6) how to monitor the AI when it makes consequential decisions; and (7) any other information reasonably necessary for the deployer to understand the outputs and monitor the AI's performance.[37] Developers that are also deployers do not have to produce these documents if the AI system is not provided to an entity unaffiliated with the developer-deployer.[38] Otherwise, developers that make an AI system available to deployers or other developers must make the documentation and information available that is necessary to conduct an impact assessment.[39]\n\nFourth, the developer must display on their website or in a public use case inventory a summary of the types of high-risks systems developed or intentionally and substantially modified that the developer currently makes available, as well as how the developer manages the known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.[40] This summary is required to be updated as necessary to be accurate and must be updated within 90 days of any intentional and substantial modification to an AI system.[41]\n\nFifth, the developer must inform the attorney general of any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination stemming from the system's intended use case.[42] The developer has at most 90 days from either when the developer discovers the AI has caused or is reasonably likely to cause algorithmic discrimination or when the developer received a report of algorithmic discrimination from a deployer.[43] The attorney general may request the developer's documentation to ensure compliance with the new law.[44]\n\nOther Regulations\n\nWhile the bulk of the law focuses on regulating high-risk AI systems, the law also regulates AI systems generally. Deployers and developers that make any AI system designed for interacting with consumers available must make consumers aware that they are interacting with an AI system, unless a reasonable person would know they are interacting with an AI system.[45]\n\nAdditionally, information protected by state or federal law, such as work product and trade secrets, is not required to be disclosed by deployers or developers of high-risk systems to anyone but the attorney general.[46] When the deployer claims that the information requested is protected, they must notify the consumer and explain why the information is protected.[47]\n\nEnforcement\n\nA violation of the new law is also a violation of Colorado's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"CUDTPA\").[48] The attorney general has the exclusive authority to enforce the new AI consumer protections through the CUDTPA.[49] However, the law creates an affirmative defense for developers, deployers, and other regulated persons if the violation is discovered and cured based on: solicited feedback; adversarial testing or red teaming; or an internal review and the system is otherwise in compliance with a risk management framework.[50] Additionally, the attorney general can promulgate rules related to: requirements and documents for developers; requirements and contents of notices and disclosures; contents and requirements of AI risk management policies and impact assessments; and the requirements to establish the rebuttable presumption of care and to establish the affirmative defense.[51]", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Standards and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Electrotechnical Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable person"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

But being first at rule-making is worthless if rules are not effectively enforced.\n\nThe newly set up EU AI Office, a renamed unit within the European Commission, has the mandate to implement and enforce critical elements of the law. It aims to be the EU's \"centre of AI expertise\".\n\nOne of its first tasks involves kick-starting the process to draft codes of practice for general purpose AI systems. These codes will translate the legal requirements in the AI Act into detailed instructions. They are expected to be ready nine months after the law enters into force -- around April 2025.\n\nDespite being called \"codes\", they are less optional than they may seem.\n\nThese codes are not legally binding, but they are very attractive for large AI companies. By default, in the short term, companies that follow the codes will be presumed to be compliant with the law. And non-compliance can attract fines after July 2025. These codes are intended to protect people from AI harms.\n\nBut companies such as OpenAI and Google would be keen to make these codes as weak as possible and as close to their internal policies -- the EU AI Office should prevent this.\n\nThus, the pen holders of these codes play an important role. The EU AI Office has not made any public statements on this. Until recently, it was not clear who the code drafters will be. But reports reveal that the EU AI Office does not plan to run the process but to watch from the sidelines, along with you and me.\n\nThe drafting will be outsourced to consulting firms. We could see Big 4 consulting firms writing rules with and for their partners OpenAI and Microsoft. The EU's message to the companies seems to be: You and your friends write the rules you wish to follow.\n\nThis scenario can be prevented. Now.\n\nThere is no responsible AI without a responsible regulator. The EU has the tools in its possession. It should act responsibly. The \"centre of AI expertise\" should not outsource important tasks to scandalous consultancy firms. Responsible AI regulators do not allow OpenAI to write EU rules.\n\nOpenAI helped make AI harms scalable. With able assistance from Microsoft and Google, it will prevent the EU from setting and enforcing strong rules.\n\nThe EU AI Office should draft the codes through a multistakeholder process. The process should include industry, especially EU companies developing, fine-tuning or using general purpose AI systems, civil society organisations, and independent scientists. These stakeholders should be involved at every step of the drafting process. Not just at the end.\n\nThe process of inviting participants to the drafting process should be transparent to the public. Opaque processes and decisions will not increase public trust in the EU AI Office.\n\nLack of time is no excuse for not including diverse and essential stakeholders. The short deadline of nine months to develop the codes necessitates fast drafting. But speed should not come at the cost of weak rules written by companies with vested interests.\n\nEven in fields where fast and best go together, a false start is not an option. Usain Bolt was disqualified for a false start in the 100 metres World Championship in 2011. Bolt could come back and win the gold medal in the London Olympics in 2012.\n\nIf it makes a false start, the EU AI Office will not get a second chance.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Council_for_Civil_Liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Council for Civil Liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consulting firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/49801186563_ee995762b2_k-800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He explained that in addition to affecting the health of patients, these errors could erode trust in AI and therefore undermine the potential long-term benefits of this technology.\n\nThe WHO, in this sense, demanded that rigorous supervision so that AI is used safely and effectively. \"This includes widespread adherence to the key values of transparency, inclusiveness, public participation, expert oversight and rigorous evaluation,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO is concerned about AI chatbots in several ways. On the one hand, there are the biases and \"serious errors\" in the information that these systems write. \"They can be misused to generate and spread highly convincing disinformation\"which the public will find difficult to differentiate from reliable health content, the agency maintains.\n\nThese models, on the other hand, are trained with data for which consent for such use may not have been previously provided. \"They may not protect sensitive data (including health data) that a user provides to an application to generate a response,\" the statement said.\n\nThe WHO urged governments to regulate and regulate AI developments to ensure the safety and protection of patients. \"It is imperative that the risks are carefully examined,\" he insisted.\n\nBefore the current \"boom\" of AI, the WHO had already done the homework. The body published in 2021 a guide about AI Ethics and Governance to health. It was the result of a year and a half of work by a team made up of experts in ethics, digital technology, law, human rights and representatives of the Ministries of Health.\n\nThe document contains a set of recommendations to ensure that all stakeholders, both in the public and private sector, accountable and that their decisions respond to the needs of health workers and the well-being of people. It establishes basic principles such as ensuring inclusion and equity, fostering responsibility and promoting sustainable AI.", "source": {"uri": "bullfrag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bullfrag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_participation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public participation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imgs.hipertextual.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ia-oms.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

In hindsight, that was a significant moment in history because the start-up went on to develop one of the AI industry's most advanced applications, ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT and many of its competitors can already generate text, images, videos, and computer code on command. But Nvidia and its peers are designing hardware that is more powerful and more energy efficient, paving the way for the development of even better AI applications with expanded capabilities.\n\nHere are five semiconductor stocks investors might want to buy during the AI revolution.\n\nNvidia is best known for designing the most powerful data center graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development. But the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform is an entire cloud-based operating system for AI developers that extends far beyond chips alone.\n\nThe platform offers developers a library of ready-made large language models (LLMs) they can use to build AI applications, which can save them substantial amounts of time and money. It's also home to CUDA (the software layer of the GPU), which allows developers to optimize their chips so they can build applications more quickly. CUDA can't be used with any other chips, so data center operators need to stick with Nvidia's hardware or risk upsetting customers who are proficient with the software.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark in the AI industry, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its Blackwell architecture. The upcoming GB200 GPU, for example, can can perform AI inference at five times the speed of the H100, which will reduce costs for developers, who often pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia stock has tripled over the past year alone, and it probably isn't done moving higher. Wall Street thinks the company will bring in over $120 billion in revenue during the current 2025 fiscal year (ending Jan. 30, 2025), which is nearly double its result from fiscal 2024. The majority of that revenue will come from its AI-focused data center segment.\n\nNvidia is struggling to meet demand for its GPUs, so some of its biggest customers are turning to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) instead. AMD's MI300 GPU is winning over data center titans like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, which have found that it offers inference performance and cost advantages over the H100.\n\nAMD's data center revenue surged 80% to $2.3 billion during the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). The company expects to generate $4 billion in sales from its GPUs alone this year, which is up from a January forecast of $3.5 billion.\n\nBut AMD has taken a leadership position in another crucial area of AI: personal computing. It says millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI chips have shipped to date -- from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus -- giving AMD a 90% market share in this segment.\n\nThe company is working closely with Microsoft to develop new Ryzen chips capable of processing the growing suite of AI features built into the Windows operating system.\n\nAMD stock is up 51% over the past year, but it remains 18% below its all-time high. Now might be a great time to buy as the company's AI revenue ramps up in both the data center and PC segments.\n\nUnlike Nvidia and AMD, Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS) doesn't produce any chips. It makes ion implantation equipment that is crucial for the fabrication of processors (CPUs), memory chips, and storage chips. AI applications require higher capacities from all three, which presents a big opportunity for this company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's data center GPUs have built-in memory, and advanced models like the Blackwell GB200 even come with built-in CPUs for higher efficiency.\n\nPlus, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require more processing power and up to twice as much memory capacity as their predecessors. As a result, Axcelis CEO Russell Low says AI will require significant manufacturing capacity expansions throughout the semiconductor industry, which should lead to more sales of the company's equipment.\n\nIn addition, power devices (chips that regulate the flow of electrical power in high-current workloads) are very implant-intensive to manufacture. Demand is rapidly growing for AI data centers, which is driving up demand for energy generation, distribution, and cooling. And that, in turn, drives up demand for Axcelis' equipment.\n\nDespite soaring 835% over the last five years, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 18.7, which is a 49% discount to the 36.9 P/E of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. In other words, Axcelis stock would have to almost double just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry. That spells opportunity for investors.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a multifaceted AI play. It makes hardware and software networking solutions for data centers, including its switches, which regulate how quickly data travels between servers and devices. They are key components when thousands of GPUs are clustered together to process vast amounts of data in AI development.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended May 5), sales of Broadcom's Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 switches doubled compared to the year-ago period.\n\nMany of its subsidiaries are also using AI. It acquired Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019, which is using Alphabet's Vertex AI platform to bring AI to its cybersecurity software. Broadcom also acquired cloud software provider VMware for $69 billion in 2023, which allows developers to create virtual machines. This means multiple users can plug into one server to use all of its capacity, which is important during a time when AI infrastructure is in short supply.\n\nBroadcom says its companywide AI revenue soared 280% year over year to $3.1 billion during the second quarter. The company expects to deliver a record high $51 billion in total revenue for the whole of fiscal 2024, with $11 billion coming from AI specifically.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require significantly more memory capacity than non-AI devices. That's because AI applications need mountains of data to function, and memory chips serve as a brain that temporarily stores that information in a ready state. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is a leading provider of memory and storage chips, and it's experiencing a wave of demand as a result of the AI revolution.\n\nEvery tier 1 manufacturer of Android-based AI smartphones (like Samsung) uses Micron's LPDDR5X memory chip. It offers between 12 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of capacity, which is 50% to 100% more memory than previous flagship smartphones required. Plus, the minimum memory requirement for Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PCs is 16 gigabytes, which is twice the minimum amount its previous Surface lineup needed. This trend spells more revenue for Micron.\n\nOn the data center side, Micron's HBM3e (high-bandwidth memory) solution is used in Nvidia's new H200 GPU. It can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which translates to substantial cost savings for data center operators.\n\nMicron says HBM3e contributed $100 million to its revenue during the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30). By the end of fiscal 2024, it expects to have sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- but that is forecast to grow into the billions of dollars in fiscal 2025.\n\nMicron is already completely sold out of HBM3e memory for the next two years, which should give the company an incredible amount of pricing power and, therefore, drive significant growth in its profitability.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

These disclosures, first reported by Bloomberg, reflect growing concerns about AI's potential to cause reputational harm, legal liability and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAI Concerns Across the Tech Industry\n\nMicrosoft's filing expressed a generally optimistic view of AI but underscored the dangers of poor implementation. The company warned that flawed algorithms, biased datasets and harmful AI-generated content could cause \"reputational or competitive harm or liability.\" It also highlighted the challenges posed by existing and proposed legislation, such as the EU's AI Act and the U.S.'s AI Executive Order, which could further complicate AI deployment and acceptance.\n\nSimilarly, Google's filing mirrored many of Microsoft's concerns. Google emphasized potential issues related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, and data privacy. The company stressed the ethical challenges posed by AI and the necessity for substantial investment to manage these risks responsibly. Google acknowledged the possibility of regulatory action and reputational harm if AI-related issues are not addressed in a timely manner.\n\nMeta's disclosure took a cautious stance, warning that its AI initiatives might not succeed, potentially leading to business, operational and financial risks. The company expressed concerns about the substantial risks of harmful or illegal content, misinformation, bias and cybersecurity threats. Meta also highlighted the evolving regulatory landscape, noting that increased scrutiny could adversely impact its business. Additionally, Meta pointed out the competitive pressures from other firms developing similar AI technologies.\n\nRelated: UK Regulator Investigates Tech Giants' AI Partnerships Amid Competition Concerns\n\nNVIDIA, while not dedicating a section specifically to AI risk factors, mentioned the issue extensively within its broader regulatory concerns. The company discussed potential impacts from various laws and regulations, including those related to intellectual property, data privacy and cybersecurity. NVIDIA noted the specific challenges posed by AI technologies, such as export controls and geopolitical tensions, and highlighted the potential for significant compliance costs and operational disruptions due to increased regulatory focus on AI.\n\nBroader Industry Impact\n\nBloomberg also identified other companies, such as Adobe, Dell, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks and Uber, as having published similar AI risk disclosures in their SEC filings. These disclosures indicate a widespread acknowledgment across the tech industry of the various risks associated with AI.\n\nManaging Risks\n\nDespite these extensive risk disclosures, Bloomberg noted that the identified risks are not necessarily likely outcomes but rather precautions to avoid being singled out for responsibility. Adam Pritchard, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told Bloomberg, \"If one company hasn't disclosed a risk that peers have, they can become a target for lawsuits.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bigtech-giants-e1625154383889.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

This eye-opening research, conducted at the University of Reading, serves as a \"wake-up call\" for the education sector, highlighting the urgent need to address the challenges posed by AI in academic settings.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, aptly described as a real-world \"Turing test,\" involved secretly submitting AI-generated exam answers alongside those of real students across five undergraduate psychology modules. The results were nothing short of astonishing. A staggering 94% of the AI-written submissions went undetected by examiners, despite being entirely produced by an AI system without any human modification.\n\nBut the surprises didn't end there. Not only did the AI submissions fly under the radar, but they also consistently outperformed their human counterparts. On average, the AI-generated answers scored half a grade boundary higher than those of real students. In some cases, the AI advantage approached a full grade boundary, with AI submissions achieving first-class honors while human students lagged behind.\n\nThis revelation raises profound questions about the future of education and assessment. As AI technologies like ChatGPT become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, how can universities ensure the integrity of their exams and the value of their degrees? The study's findings suggest that current methods of detecting AI-generated content are woefully inadequate, leaving educational institutions vulnerable to a new form of high-tech cheating.\n\n\"Many institutions have moved away from traditional exams to make assessment more inclusive. Our research shows it is of international importance to understand how AI will affect the integrity of educational assessments,\" says co-author Peter Scarfe, an associate professor at Reading's School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, in a statement.\n\n\"We won't necessarily go back fully to hand-written exams, but global education sector will need to evolve in the face of AI,\" he continues. \"It is testament to the candid academic rigour and commitment to research integrity at Reading that we have turned the microscope on ourselves to lead in this.\"\n\nThe implications of this research extend far beyond the halls of academia. In a world where AI can seamlessly mimic human intelligence in written assessments, employers may find themselves questioning the reliability of academic credentials. Moreover, the very nature of learning and knowledge acquisition could be called into question. If AI can ace exams without understanding or retaining information, what does this mean for the future of education and professional development?\n\nThe researchers behind the study emphasize that their findings should not be seen as an indictment of current educational practices but rather as a call to action. They argue that the education sector must adapt to this new reality, finding ways to harness the power of AI while maintaining the integrity and value of human learning.\n\n\"As a sector, we need to agree how we expect students to use and acknowledge the role of AI in their work. The same is true of the wider use of AI in other areas of life to prevent a crisis of trust across society,\" adds co-author Etienne Roesch, a professor in Reading's School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences. \"Our study highlights the responsibility we have as producers and consumers of information. We need to double down on our commitment to academic and research integrity.\"\n\nAs we grapple with these challenges, one thing is clear: the landscape of education is changing rapidly, and institutions must evolve to keep pace. The ability to detect and manage AI use in academic settings will likely become a crucial skill for educators and administrators alike. At the same time, there may be opportunities to integrate AI into the learning process in ways that enhance rather than undermine human education.\n\nThis alarming study serves as both a warning and an invitation - a chance to reimagine education for the AI age. As we move forward, the goal will be to find a balance that embraces technological advancement while preserving the unique value of human intelligence and creativity.", "source": {"uri": "studyfinds.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Study Finds"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Reading", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Reading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PLOS One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turing test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associate professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reading School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British undergraduate degree classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mimicry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 30}], "image": "https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-students-cheating-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Adjunct Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, driving innovation and enhancing productivity. Paradoxically, it also has the potential to undermine the very companies that adopt the tools.\n\nThis paradox is especially evident when AI generates content and performs tasks that traditionally require a deep well of human expertise. The crux of the issue lies in the erosion of skills and knowledge.\n\nLet's investigate this phenomenon.\n\nSome may say it is counterintuitive, but the most natural AI utilization observed in today's corporate landscape often comes from seasoned professionals. Assumed to be less technologically inclined (blame societal bias for that), these individuals, who have climbed the ranks through years of experience, are adept at using AI tools to enhance their productivity because of the natural fit AI tools have with their current way of doing.\n\nThey leverage AI to generate content, which they review and edit, ensuring high-quality outputs. Much like how they review, give feedback and improve upon the work within their teams, their expertise allows them to identify best practices, maintain style and methodological consistency and optimize AI systems effectively by providing learning feedback.\n\nBecause they already naturally tend to have a supervisory role, using AI is just an extension of the same role -- a symbiotic relationship.\n\nHowever, a significant issue arises with the emerging workforce. These individuals often lack the extensive professional experience of their predecessors. They are less familiar with industry conventions, best practices and effective methodologies.\n\nNothing is inherently flawed with this, and it is only natural that as we transition from theoretical or academic knowledge into applied knowledge, we gain a lot of practical work experience.\n\nAs a result, their early reliance on AI can lead to a dangerous cycle: They depend on AI to generate content and perform tasks, but without the necessary background, experience and applied understanding, they cannot adequately review, edit or improve upon the AI's outputs.\n\nThey often use the output as is or with minimal modifications. In my experience, this can lead to functional but inefficient code, presentations and reports that may outline the \"correct\" concepts but lack the necessary critical synthesis. It all just feels a bit \"off.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the teams maintaining the AI tools, this conundrum can fail to optimize AI systems properly. When AI systems lack high-quality input for training, their outputs deteriorate over time. Consequently, this cycle perpetuates itself, leading to progressively poorer outcomes.\n\nIn the short term, the effects of this dependency on AI may not be immediately apparent. Current workforce structures still include experienced professionals who manage and supervise production effectively.\n\nAs these seasoned experts leave the workforce, however, the problem will become more pronounced. The newer, less experienced employees ascend to senior positions without the same depth of knowledge and skill sets as their predecessors.\n\nThis shift could lead to a gradual erosion of institutional knowledge and expertise. We are simply not training and preparing for shifts properly due to the pursuit of short-term efficiencies.\n\nThe ramifications of knowledge erosion are far-reaching and can even affect our cognitive abilities.\n\nMany drivers, for example, now rely on GPS devices. This reliance can lead to a loss of important skills like reading maps and following directions. What happens when technology fails? A 2020 study showed that regular users of GPS relied less on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Not only did they have a reduced sense of orientation, but lesser grey matter in the hippocampus.\n\nAs knowledge erosion takes hold in the corporate world, companies must ensure their workforce understands the fundamental knowledge behind their tasks. Employees who rely too heavily on technology without a solid grasp of the basics may struggle to solve problems, adapt to new situations or create innovative solutions.\n\nEvery major workforce shift has raised this issue. During the Industrial Revolution, a similar debate arose: If workers are not trained in hand-sewing with a thread and needle, will they know how to optimize factory lines? Master craftspeople emerged, according to research by Morgan Kelly, Joel Mokyr and Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, spending all their time and training understanding sewing techniques, threading, laminating, etc. Although there were fewer of them due to scale, they became highly skilled experts in their craft.\n\nTo avoid this impending crisis, companies must adopt strategies that balance AI's benefits with the need to preserve and cultivate human expertise. Here a few ideas on how to do so:\n\n1. Structured Mentorship Programs: Senior professionals should mentor junior employees, passing on their knowledge and expertise. This mentorship can help bridge the gap between seasoned and emerging workers.\n\n2. Continuous Learning And Development: Companies should invest in continuous learning programs that ensure employees at all levels stay updated with industry best practices, methodologies and technological advancements.\n\n3. Hiring Inquisitive People Who WANT To Learn: I cannot stress this enough. Companies need to cut through the mutual performative theater of acting like they want to teach and employees acting like they want to learn. Identify humans who are inquisitive and want to understand what they are doing. It is probably the most challenging advice to follow and highly imperfect to execute.\n\n4. Hybrid Approach: Encourage a hybrid approach, viewing AI as a tool to augment human capabilities rather than replace them. AI really should stand for augmented intelligence. This approach ensures that human oversight and critical thinking remain integral to the process. People need to understand what the AI tools are outputting, why it works, etc.\n\n5. Quality Assurance Teams: Establish dedicated quality assurance teams tasked with reviewing AI outputs and holding the employees who use the tools accountable for the quality generated. These teams should comprise experienced professionals.\n\n6. Feedback Loops: Implement robust feedback loops where employees can share their insights and learnings.\n\nToo often, we read articles about AI replacing people. AI has the potential to transform industries and drive significant advancements. However, it is crucial to recognize and address the risks associated with over-reliance, particularly the erosion of human expertise.\n\nCompanies must take proactive steps to harness the benefits of AI while preserving the valuable knowledge and skills that traditionally drive sustainable, high-quality outcomes. We need to appreciate the idea of AI as a tool, not as an employee.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

The rapid pace of adoption is unlike anything we've experienced before, and it could end up being more influential than the arrival of the PC, the internet, social media, mobile, and cloud technology transitions that preceded it.\n\nAccording to our recent global study of more than 2,200 professionals working in the fields of law, tax, accounting, risk, compliance, and other knowledge fields, there's a tremendous sense of excitement about the here-and-now and future potential of generative AI to improve their work -- not to mention their work-life balance.\n\nProfessionals now have a better sense of how AI will affect their work -- and in some cases, it already is. Our second annual Future of Professionals survey found that 63% of the people we polled have already used gen AI in their day-to-day work to draft documents, summarize information, and perform basic research. Notably, more than three-quarters of the professionals surveyed consider AI a force for good -- and that's true across different geographies and professions. Respondents predicted that more than half of professional work will use AI-powered technology in five years.\n\nThe most commonly predicted benefits of new AI-powered technologies include the greater value it will bring to their work (38% of respondents), increased efficiency and productivity (26%), and freed-up time (28%). This overall positive sentiment around AI may be all the more significant because it provides a measurable counter-narrative to the doom-and-gloom predictions that this technology will destroy jobs. In fact, only 10% of respondents were concerned about widespread job losses in their industry.\n\nTime savings and more meaningful work\n\nIt's not the first time that the workplace has seen tech-driven transformations. I think about my grandmother, who was one of the first women in Australia to work in a bank and spent her days manually adding columns of data by hand. Personal computers and spreadsheet software made calculating data by hand obsolete, but it didn't end the profession of accounting.\n\nSimilarly, AI has the potential to automate labor-intensive or routine tasks to transform the way professional work is done and make a career in these fields more appealing. Professionals predict that work will be more fulfilling with less time spent on the type of tasks that AI could most easily address.\n\nNearly 60% of respondents want to see their profession focus on a better work-life balance in the future, while 42% would like to spend more time on engaging, creative work. In short, professional careers could become more appealing. Such changes could be particularly significant in the U.S. accounting industry, which in recent years has had trouble attracting young people to the field.\n\nBy automating the most routine tasks, our report shows that professionals predict AI could free up as much as four hours a week in the next year. What will they do with 200 extra hours of time a year? Maybe they'll have more time to spend on their non-work lives. Or they might reinvest some of that time in more strategic work, innovation, and professional development.\n\nFor U.S. lawyers alone, that would represent a collective 266 million hours of increased productivity. That's the equivalent of adding an additional colleague for every 10 already on a team. It translates to more than $100,000 in new, billable time per lawyer each year, based on current average rates, with similar value and productivity gains projected across various professions.\n\nIn five years, our respondents predicted, the time savings could amount to 12 hours a week, more than 620 hours a year. Imagine the broader impact on the economy and GDP from this increased efficiency.\n\nThe real concerns of knowledge workers\n\nOf course, change naturally makes some people nervous -- and for good reason. The top concern among professionals is that people will rely too much on AI-powered technology rather than using their professional judgment. Many also worry about the accuracy of gen AI results, which is why almost two-thirds of respondents said a human's involvement in the loop is crucial for responsible use.\n\nWe can also expect bad actors to try to wield new technology in nefarious ways. Two-thirds of respondents cited data security as a concern.\n\nGovernment workers were the most concerned about the use of AI in their sector. And the vast majority of professionals in the legal and tax sectors indicated that allowing AI to represent clients in court or make final decisions would be a step too far.\n\nConcerns around ethics and oversight only heighten the imperative that we as a tech community build AI applications responsibly and ethically. Because there are not yet generally agreed-upon ethics around gen AI, there have been controversies surrounding its use, such as the collection of personal and copyrighted data from online sources to build large language models.\n\nThe future of AI is not predestined -- it is ours to shape. We welcome the collaboration of the broader tech community in responsibly pushing innovation forward while embracing the benefits this transformative technology can bring.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Meanwhile, business leaders in the U.K. reported 70% of their organizations are using generative AI, and U.S. leaders reported 65%.\n\nChina's lead is due to continuous automated monitoring, according to the study, which mostly means making sure the organization is working properly, Bryan Harris, chief technology officer at SAS, told Quartz.\n\nThe country's investment in manufacturing technology \"allows them to integrate continuous automated monitoring systems to monitor and optimize production,\" Udo Sglavo, vice president of applied AI and modeling research and development at SAS, said in a statement shared with Quartz. \"Predictive maintenance and worker safety systems are good examples of places where continuous automated monitoring would be incorporated. With the help of GenAI technologies, systems like these detect anomalies, help build natural language interfaces, and create automated alerts and notifications so users can respond appropriately.\"\n\nMeanwhile, organizations in the U.S. lead the rest of the world when it comes to \"maturity and having fully implemented GenAI technologies,\" the study, which included 1,600 business decision-makers in industries including banking, healthcare, and retail, said.\n\n\"While China may lead in GenAI adoption rates, higher adoption doesn't necessarily equate to effective implementation or better returns,\" Stephen Saw, managing director at Coleman Parkes, said in a statement. \"In fact, the U.S. nudges ahead in the race with 24% of organizations having fully implemented GenAI compared to 19% in China.\" The U.K., meanwhile, came in at 11%. Most organizations involved in the study are using generative AI for content creation, such as for marketing, and for customer service, Harris said.\n\nHarris says he's not surprised that China's adoption rate of generative AI is higher, because the country's government is \"much more efficient\" with issuing directives, and that includes telling organizations to use AI. Meanwhile, the U.S. is \"a little more measured in our approach to generative AI,\" Harris said. He added that it's important that the U.S. \"be more novel, more innovative, and more compliant to regulatory oversight so that when we develop this stuff, it has the intended outcomes for what we want in business,\" as well as the people and populations AI will impact.\n\nOver the next year, Harris said he sees \"more narrowing\" with the use of AI as organizations determine where generative AI is delivering real value to the business.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAS (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quartz (publication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/a641b9ceb6400af6c3ef803278b5228e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

But now, some prominent analysts are saying the AI investment craze may be, in fact, crazy.\n\nIn late June, analysts from Goldman Sachs, Barclays Investment Bank and venture giant Sequoia Capital each raised different versions of the same red flag. They argued in an interview, a note to clients and a blog post, respectively, that the mind-boggling amounts of money being dumped into AI will be very difficult to recoup. The technology's development is extremely expensive, and its much-hyped benefits are totally unproven. In other words, some of the world's largest companies and Silicon Valley's best-known investors may be flushing cash down the drain.\n\nOr burning it. Sequoia's David Cahn wrote that \"speculative investment frenzies,\" like the one happening now for AI, \"often lead to high rates of capital incineration.\"\n\nMore to come on Cahn's post later. First, here are some eye-popping numbers to provide context for that \"capital incineration.\" In April, Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said she expected the company to spend around $48 billion this year on capital expenditures -- that's mostly chips, servers and data centers, the technical tools for AI products. Meta put its estimate at $35 billion to $40 billion and wrote it would spend even more next year to \"invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\" This binge, mirrored at Microsoft and Amazon, is part of what's propelled San Jose-based Nvidia to a $3.15 trillion valuation -- Wall Street is thrilled about the chip designer's revenues and the idea that tech's titans will keep growing.\n\nInvestors are dumping cash into AI outside of Big Tech as well. San Francisco startup Scale AI just secured $1 billion in funding at a $13.8 billion valuation. Elon Musk's xAI announced a $6 billion raise in May. Salesforce has a $500 million pot for investing in AI startups; Reuters reported that's the same amount of cash the AI startup Cohere is looking for in its next funding round.\n\nCahn, like most investors, is betting on AI as an economic engine; his firm, Sequoia, is one of xAI's major backers. He even wrote in his post that he sees \"speculative frenzies\" like this one as an inherent part of the tech industry. But he added that the idea companies need to shell out cash to stockpile computing chips is a \"delusion\" that has \"spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world.\"\n\nThat's a point of view seemingly shared by Ross Sandler, a San Francisco-based research analyst at Barclays, and Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs' head of global equity research. They each gave a straightforward explanation for the massive investment in computing chips, data centers and other AI-aiding tech: FOMO.\n\nSandler, per Marketwatch, wrote in a note to clients that the fear of missing out on AI's potential future, rather than actual evidence, is likely what's leading to the big spending. He wrote, per the outlet, that huge companies' estimated AI investment in 2026 would be enough to \"support the existing internet plus 12,000 new ChatGPT-scale AI products.\" He's saying that the data center capacities of Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon will far, far exceed what people currently seem to ask of the internet.\n\nHe wrote, according to Marketwatch, that his team expects some company to \"flinch\" away from the spending next year. Covello, of Goldman Sachs, was harsher on AI's future. He estimated that the next several years will see $1 trillion in AI investment and asked, \"What $1tn problem will AI solve?\"\n\nCovello pointed out that replacing low-wage jobs with expensive technology isn't likely to recoup companies' investments, and he poured water on the idea that AI would ever be able to solve complex problems. He said big tech companies \"have no choice but to engage in the AI arms race right now given the hype around the space and FOMO\" but pointed to Salesforce, which has been investing in AI but just suffered a massive stock sell-off, as a cautionary tale.\n\n\"Over-building things the world doesn't have use for, or is not ready for, typically ends badly,\" Covello said, referencing the dot-com bust of the early aughts. He added that if the AI tech doesn't have as many uses as people are expecting, it will be \"problematic for many companies spending on the technology today.\"\n\nThen, the veteran analyst offered some slightly spooky wisdom: \"One of the most important lessons I've learned over the past three decades is that bubbles can take a long time to burst.\"", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType":

This article will guide you through practical methods to identify artificially written content.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to identify AI-generated content is by using AI checkers. These tools are specifically designed to analyze text and determine its origin. By examining patterns, syntax, and word usage, the AI checker can give you a probability score indicating whether the content was created by a machine.\n\nTools like GPTZero and OpenAI's AI content detector are widely used for this purpose. These tools work by comparing the text against known examples of AI-generated content, allowing them to detect subtle clues that may not be apparent to human readers.\n\nAI-generated content often follows certain patterns. Machines tend to produce text that is highly structured and consistent. Look for repetitive phrases or a lack of variation in sentence structure. Human writers usually have a more diverse style, incorporating different sentence lengths and structures to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, AI-generated content may exhibit a more formulaic approach, lacking the spontaneity and variability that characterize human writing. For instance, AI might overuse certain phrases or constructs that are commonly found in its training data.\n\nA key difference between human and AI writing is the ability to understand and convey context. AI can sometimes struggle with nuanced topics or complex ideas. If the content seems to lack depth or fails to address the subtleties of a topic, it might be AI-generated. Humans, on the other hand, tend to provide richer context and more detailed explanations. This is particularly evident in how human writers handle ambiguous or culturally specific references, which AI might misinterpret or oversimplify.\n\nHuman writers often inject creativity and originality into their work. They use metaphors, analogies, and unique expressions to convey their ideas. AI, while capable of generating coherent text, often lacks this creative touch. If the content feels too generic or formulaic, it could be a sign that it was written by a machine. Human creativity also shows in the ability to generate novel ideas and perspectives, which AI might struggle with due to its reliance on pre-existing data. Look for elements like humor, irony, and cultural references that are typically more challenging for AI to generate convincingly.\n\nHumans naturally infuse their writing with emotion and personality. AI-generated content can sometimes feel flat or devoid of emotion. Pay attention to the tone of the text. If it seems too neutral or robotic, it might be a product of artificial intelligence. Human writers can convey a wide range of emotions through their word choice and sentence structure, creating a connection with the reader that AI often lacks. This is especially true in content that deals with personal experiences or subjective opinions, where the human touch is more apparent.\n\nAI, despite its advancements, can still make mistakes that a human wouldn't. Look for inconsistencies in the text, such as sudden changes in tone, style, or topic. These abrupt shifts can indicate that different AI models or algorithms were used, or that the AI struggled to maintain coherence. Inconsistencies might also arise from the AI's attempt to blend multiple sources of information, leading to conflicting statements or logical gaps. Additionally, AI might produce content that seems disjointed or lacks a clear narrative flow, which can be a giveaway of its non-human origin.\n\nAI often relies on vast datasets to generate content but may lack specific, detailed knowledge about niche topics. Ask specific questions related to the subject matter. If the content fails to provide detailed or accurate answers, it could be a sign that it was generated by an AI. Human experts in a field can provide nuanced insights and detailed explanations that AI might miss. This is particularly useful in technical or specialized content, where the depth of understanding required can reveal the limitations of AI-generated text. Additionally, humans can cross-reference information and provide critical analysis, which AI might not be able to do effectively.\n\nHuman writers typically craft engaging introductions and conclusions that tie the content together. AI-generated content may have introductions and conclusions that feel generic or disconnected from the main body. Analyze these sections to see if they provide a cohesive overview and summary of the topic. Human introductions often set the stage with a compelling hook or a relevant anecdote, while conclusions summarize key points and offer a final insight or call to action. AI, on the other hand, might produce introductions and conclusions that merely restate the topic or fail to add meaningful closure to the discussion.\n\nHuman writers usually include specific details and examples to support their arguments. AI-generated content might lack this level of detail and instead provide more general statements. Look for the presence of concrete examples, statistics, and anecdotes that illustrate the points being made. These details not only add credibility but also show the writer's engagement with the topic. AI might struggle to incorporate such specifics naturally, leading to content that feels more superficial or vague.\n\nHumor and cultural references are areas where AI often falls short. Human writers use these elements to connect with their audience on a personal level. AI-generated content might attempt humor but often misses the mark or comes off as forced. Similarly, cultural references that require a deep understanding of societal norms and nuances can be challenging for AI to replicate authentically. Pay attention to how humor is used and whether cultural references feel genuine and relevant.\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, distinguishing between human and AI-generated content becomes more challenging. By utilizing AI checkers, analyzing writing patterns, and evaluating contextual understanding, you can develop a keen eye for identifying artificially written content. Remember, the key lies in the details -- creativity, emotional tone, and consistency are hallmarks of human writing that machines often struggle to replicate.", "source": {"uri": "star2.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Two"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kathy_scribner@star2.org", "name": "Kathy Scribner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syntax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Checkers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.star2.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Identify-Artificially-Written-Content.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

But deploying systems in this context is not without risks for those affected, a new study warns.\n\nHumanitarian organisations have been increasingly using digital technologies and the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend.\n\nAI-supported disaster mapping was used in Mozambique to speed up emergency response, and AI systems were used to predict food crisis and rolled out by the World Bank across twenty-one countries.\n\nBut the study warns some uses of AI may expose people to additional harms and present significant risks for the protection of their rights.\n\nThe study, published in the Handbook on Warfare and Artificial Intelligence, is by Professor Ana Beduschi, from the University of Exeter Law School.\n\nProfessor Beduschi said: \"AI technologies have the potential to further expand the toolkit of humanitarian missions in their preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n\"But safeguards must be put in place to ensure that AI systems used to support the work of humanitarians are not transformed into tools of exclusion of populations in need of assistance. Safeguards concerning the respect and protection of data privacy should also be put in place.\n\n\"The humanitarian imperative of 'do no harm' should be paramount to all deployment of AI systems in situations of conflict and crisis.\"\n\nThe study says humanitarian organisations designing AI systems should ensure data protection by design and by default to minimise risks of harm - whether they are legally obliged to do so or not. They should also use Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to understand the potential negative impacts of these technologies.\n\nGrievance mechanisms should also be established so people can challenge decisions that were either automated or made by humans with the support of AI systems if these adversely impacted them.\n\nProfessor Beduschi said: \"AI systems can analyse large amounts of multidimensional data at increasingly fast speeds, identify patterns in the data, and predict future behaviour. That can help organisations gain crucial insights to better monitor and anticipate risks, such as a conflict outbreak or escalation.\n\n\"Yet, deploying AI systems in the humanitarian context is not without risks for the affected populations. Issues include the poor quality of the data used to train AI algorithms, the existence of algorithmic bias, the lack of transparency about AI decision-making, and the pervading concerns about the respect and protection of data privacy.\n\n\"It is crucial that humanitarians abide by the humanitarian imperative of 'do not harm' when deciding whether to deploy AI to support their action. In many cases, the sensible solution would be not to rely on AI technologies as these may cause additional harm to civilian populations.\"", "source": {"uri": "scienmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scienmag: Latest Science and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Exeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Index, which has offices in London, San Francisco and New York as well as Geneva and Jersey, has earmarked $800mn of that total for early stage start-ups and $1.5bn for larger bets on later stage companies.\n\nMore than half of its recent investments have been in AI, said Martin Mignot, another partner.\n\nIndex was an early investor in Mistral, Europe's most valuable AI start-up, and Cohere, a Toronto-headquartered start-up building AI models for enterprises. The firm has also backed Scale AI, which provides infrastructure for AI model companies and was recently valued at $14bn.\n\nThe company has examined the impact of AI on everything from accounting, to molecular research and data centre optimisation, said Mignot. \"AI is a tide that changes a lot of sectors of the economy.\"\n\nThe past year's AI investment boom has stoked concerns about a bubble forming. In a recent blog post, David Cahn, a partner at Sequoia Capital, another Silicon Valley VC firm, warned of a \"speculative frenzy\" around AI, adding that \"a lot of people lose a lot of money during speculative technology waves\".\n\nMignot admitted that hype had pushed up valuations, but argued that should not concern venture investors.\n\n\"Venture is not a value game, quite the opposite,\" he said. \"With the very best companies, you always feel like you're paying up. That's what makes you uncomfortable.\"\n\nHe added: \"A lot of the time\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009great companies [seem] very expensive, but they turn out to be very cheap in five years.\"\n\nIndex first invested in Mistral one year ago, in what was at the time the largest-ever seed round for a European start-up, putting the Paris-based company's worth at \u20ac240mn. Its valuation has since shot up to almost \u20ac6bn.\n\nMost of the tens of billions of dollars that have poured into AI start-ups have come from the biggest tech groups such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which have helped give a handful of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic a lead in developing powerful AI models.\n\n\"There might be models which are in specialised niches\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but we don't see mainstream new model companies competing against the established incumbents on their own turf,\" Hammer said. \"That's a pretty capital-intensive game.\"\n\nBut VCs with more limited resources still hope to compete and are betting that powerful AI models will create a platform for new applications, in the way that the advent of the internet or smartphones did.\n\nThere was still \"a lot of room\" for start-ups to build in areas that do not directly compete with Big Tech, said Mignot. \"AI is just a different platform to build on but the last mile [with direct relationships with customers] is still going to be very important.\"\n\nIndex's latest financing is below the $3.1bn it raised in 2021 across three new funds at the peak of the most recent tech cycle. That reflects a very different market for start-ups today, despite the huge sums raised by a few outlier AI companies.\n\n\"We want to match the fund size to the opportunity set,\" said Mignot, as round sizes at the growth stage have \"come down significantly\" in the past three years.\n\nNonetheless, the fundraising is the latest sign of a partial thaw in venture capital after two years in which firms put off seeking fresh funds.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz closed a $7.2bn fund in April, and General Catalyst is close to raising around $6bn, according to people with knowledge of the matter.",

Recent McKinsey Global Institute research sheds light on the transformations ahead on both sides of the Atlantic and highlights a dual challenge: the need to accelerate technology adoption amid tightening labor markets and a need to upskill and reskill to increase productivity growth.\n\nOur latest look at the future of work reveals that by 2030, up to 30 percent of current work hours could be automated due to automation and generative AI. Our updated modeling finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, and other high-skill professions would rise, while demand for lower-wage occupations such as office workers, production workers, and customer service representatives would decline. Efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging workforce, growth in e-commerce, infrastructure and technology investment, and overall economic growth will also affect employment demand.\n\nAutomation and generative AI represent an opportunity for productivity growth -- probably one of the biggest opportunities for productivity growth that we have seen in decades. Productivity -- the measure of a country's or company's outputs with the same inputs -- has been decelerating in the U.S. and Europe for almost a generation. We care about productivity growth because over time it is key to improving living standards. Productivity growth in the U.S. hit 4% after World War II and has been in the 1 - 2% range for the last 20 years. And while European Union productivity growth was in the 6 - 8% range for a few decades after World War II, it has been below 2% (and even often below 1%) for the last 30 years.\n\nHowever, capturing the productivity opportunity from AI will require workers to transition from declining occupations to rising ones. Companies need workers with more skills and different skills to match the jobs we will have in the future. In Europe, by our estimates, a faster technology adoption scenario could be associated with productivity growth of roughly 2 to 3 percent per year, and require some 12 million occupational transitions, roughly double the pace of pre-COVID occupational shifts. In the United States, with its more dynamic labor market, the trend would be closer to the historical norm.\n\nBusinesses will need a major skills upgrade\n\nWhile the productivity improvement from automation and generative AI is appealing, the successful integration of AI into the workplace will require a major skills upgrade. Demand for technological and social and emotional skills could rise as demand for physical and manual and higher cognitive skills stabilizes. Surveyed executives in Europe and the United States expressed a need not just for advanced IT and data analytics but also for critical thinking, creativity, and teaching and training -- skills they report as currently being in short supply. To bridge these gaps, companies are increasingly focusing on retraining their workforce, rather than relying solely on hiring or subcontracting. For example, in the automotive industry, executives anticipate that 36 percent of their workforce will require retraining, while executives in financial services indicated 28 percent of their workers will need to be retrained.\n\nThe implications of these shifts are profound, not only for businesses but also for workers across different wage brackets. Lower-wage workers, in particular, face the risk of job displacement if they cannot transition to higher-wage roles. This could lead to a more polarized labor market, with significant disparities between high and low-wage earners.\n\nTo mitigate these risks and capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI, organizations and policymakers need to foster an environment that promotes rapid technology adoption and proactive worker redeployment. This balanced approach will be crucial in turning the challenges of the AI era into opportunities to increase productivity and societal well-being.\n\nFor companies, leading through AI advancements will require a strong understanding of the potential of AI and generative AI -- not just in a few senior roles, but across a broad range of leaders. This understanding will not be static. It will require ongoing education and discussion and also feed into business planning and innovation. In addition, planning the full strategic workforce shift at the company level will require understanding what skills employees have today and what skills will be needed in the future. Mapping that out and assessing the biggest gaps and how to fill them will be key. Then training to fill those gaps or acquiring them externally will enable progress.\n\nActing on these elements can help companies and leaders make faster progress in capturing value from AI while ensuring their employees are able to capture some of the benefits as well.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66885d8a383057a5d2f1b156/0x0.png?format=png&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Overestimating the near term, underestimating the long term, Gartner's latest \"Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence\" report already has us mired in disillusionment about cloud AI services.\n\nAnd yet, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn writes so eloquently in his new book, Mastering AI, we're clearly on the precipice of having our lives transformed by technology that can heighten or threaten the essence of who we are. As he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell at his book launch in New York last night, humans have long harnessed the power of animals and technologies that exceed our physical power. \"We never really defined ourselves as a species based on brawn,\" he said. AI, on the other hand, \"challenges what makes us unique as a species, which is really our intelligence.\"\n\nThose of you who read Jeremy's articles or his Eye on AI newsletter know that he's attuned to both the potential and the perils of AI. After almost a decade of covering cutting-edge technologies, he's a master at connecting the dots. What I found most thought-provoking about his book and his comments last night is the potential consequence of outsourcing too much to any technology. We've already seen what our current tools have done to our abilities to remember phone numbers or navigate city streets, never mind its impact on public trust and mental health.\n\nWill AI enhance our expertise or ultimately diminish it?\n\nTake, for example, the fact that ChatGPT can take our ideas and mold them into an argument. \"Writing and thinking are not separable activities,\" Jeremy argued. \"I think when you lose your writing ability, you actually lose your thinking ability to some extent.\" And if we outsource judgement, he added, \"we will lose the ability to think critically.\"\n\nAnd yet, of course, the potential for AI to unleash creativity and innovation is immense. Maybe that's why the book's subtitle is \"a survival guide to our superpowered future.\" Here you can read an excerpt about how AI -- with its hidden biases -- may already be shaping how you think.\n\nThe greatest protection against losing ourselves to any algorithm is the human act of connection and conversation. Jeremy and my colleagues will no doubt debate these shifts with Fortune 500 leaders, founders, investors and other stakeholders next week at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah. Recognizing the scale and transformative impact of AI across all parts of society, we're also bringing together leaders from business, government and academia later this month for Fortune Brainstorm AI in Singapore, and again in December for Fortune Brainstorm AI in San Francisco.\n\nBut history is what happens on the ground, in rooms where we don't always get to go.

The survey of 800 IT and business leaders across Western Europe, Canada and the US by Hitachi Vantara and Enterprise Strategy Group also found that organisations based in the US were 35% more likely to say implementing the new technology within their business was a top priority than their European counterparts.\n\n\"Enterprises are clearly jumping on the GenAI bandwagon, which is not surprising, but it's also clear that the foundation for successful GenAI use is not yet built and its full potential cannot be realized,\" said Hitachi Vantara's chief technology officer, Ayman Abouelwafa. \"Unlocking the true power of GenAI, however, requires a strong foundation with a robust and secure infrastructure that can handle the demands of this powerful technology.\"\n\nAnother major concern among respondents was the innate preparedness of their own IT teams to implement generative AI solutions. 53% of IT leaders surveyed, for example, said that their colleagues were unable to keep up with the pace of innovation in the field. 40%, meanwhile, agreed that they themselves were unfamiliar with the specifics of actually deploying generative AI in new digital transformation projects.\n\nThe preparedness of companies to use generative AI to the best of their ability was also a major source of anxiety. While many firms said that they were keen on harnessing generative AI to improve process automation (37%), fraud detection (35%) and predictive analytics (36%), only 37% of IT and business leaders said that they were confident their company's data ecosystem was mature enough to handle the new technology - though of this subset of respondents, C-level executives were 1.3 times more likely to say this than those individuals further down the corporate ladder.\n\nOthers implied they had clear concerns about cost. 96% of respondents, for example, said that they preferred to harness non-proprietary models over the more expensive proprietary solutions. Meanwhile, some 78% said they were keen on pursuing hybrid cloud options to implement generative AI over and above the public cloud.\n\nAnxieties about the innate accuracy of generative AI solutions also persisted. 86% of those surveyed also said that they were planning to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a solution that allows generative AI models to fact-check their responses, before deploying any generative AI solutions. 81%, meanwhile, said that projects involving generative AI conjured forth new concerns about data privacy and compliance.\n\nDespite this, raw enthusiasm for generative AI remained strong among those surveyed. 97% of organisations said that they viewed its deployment within their business as a top priority, while almost two-thirds said that they had identified at least one use case for the technology. How long it will take to realise the oft-talked potential of generative AI for these organisations, however, remains to be seen. For now, the answer seems to be mixed.

Cruz Opens Investigation into Big Tech Funding Salaries of Biden Admin. Officials", "body": "Companies may be exploiting the Intergovernmental Personnel Act program to shape AI policy\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has opened an investigation into Big Tech companies' funding of Biden administration staff salaries through an obscure program.\n\nLast October, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to engage in over 100 specific actions to establish AI-related guidance across various policy areas, resulting in a purported need to hire hundreds of federal employees to focus on AI. In April, the White House announced that the agencies had completed all required actions, yet had hired only 150 people into AI roles, calling into question how the agencies completed so much work in such a short time.\n\nIn letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Commerce (Commerce), National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Transportation (DOT), Sen. Cruz questioned whether the Biden administration was utilizing the obscure Intergovernmental Personnel Act program to temporarily hire Big Tech AI employees to carry out President Biden's AI executive order.\n\n\"To complete every action, agencies would have had to . . . bring on AI fellows by recruiting temporary -- but influential -- AI staff from external organizations through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) program. Critics, however, have raised reasonable concerns that these influential AI fellows are shaping federal policy to benefit their organizations' funders and not the American people. Moreover, as federal agencies request increased funding for AI hiring, it is important Congress understand the extent to which, and how, agencies have already acquired AI staff in response to the expansive and demanding AI Executive Order.\"\n\nAs Sen. Cruz points out, acquiring temporary staff funded by Big Tech companies to establish and implement the administration's AI policy creates serious conflicts of interest.\n\n\"The administration's reported use of the IPA program to obtain AI staff, however, raises the question whether outside AI groups are improperly influencing federal AI policy. For instance, in March 2022, Politico reported that Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt, was using the IPA program to fund his associates' placement at the Office of Scientific and Technology Policy in the White House, which \"is executing on an aggressive agenda\" regarding \"algorithmic discrimination in the use of artificial intelligence\" -- an alarmist phrase meant to justify the unelected bureaucracy's policing and potential censorship of AI algorithms. And a March 2024 report revealed that through the IPA program, Facebook billionaire Dustin Moskovitz -- a leader of the \"Effective Altruism\" movement -- is paying the salaries of his fellows serving in AI roles at the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Commerce. In effect, large AI technology companies are influencing the Biden administration's AI policy from the inside and advancing their own anti-competitive agenda to shape the future of the AI industry.\"\n\nBecause agencies are not required to report IPA assignments, the Biden administration can utilize these Big-Tech funded AI fellows with zero transparency to the American people.\n\n\"The answer may be that agencies are utilizing the IPA program, which allows certain non-profit groups, universities, and other organizations to temporarily place their employees at federal agencies and pay their salaries. Agencies are not required to report records of IPA assignments to the Office of Personnel Management, making the program an attractive option for federal agencies to obtain talent at no cost while avoiding oversight and transparency. Indeed, the White House's AI and Tech Talent Task Force's April 2024 Report to the President recommends that he 'call[] on institutions across the tech ecosystem and agencies to consider expanding their use of and funding for these valuable talent exchange programs,' including the IPA.\"\n\nSen. Cruz concluded by requesting the FTC, Commerce, NSF, and DOT turn over documents and answer a series of written responses regarding employees or IPA program fellows hired to carry out President Biden's AI executive order no later than July 15, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "commerce.senate.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Senate Committee On Commerce, Science, & Transportation"},

When searching for details about Supreme Court precedents or polishing a college essay, millions of people seek help from AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude.\n\nIn his newly published book, Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future, Fortune AI editor Jeremy Kahn explores this new tech-infused reality and what should be done to avert the inevitable pitfalls. In the following excerpt from the book, he focuses on the little-recognized problem of subtle bias in AI and the potentially profound influence it can have on what users believe.\n\nTristan Harris, the co-founder and executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, has been called \"the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.\" He was previously a design ethicist at Google in 2015, where he weighed in on the moral implications of the company's projects. In congressional testimony in 2019, Harris argued that the most important currency for technology companies is people's attention. In trying to corner the market for users' attention, tech companies were engaging in a \"race to the bottom of the brain stem,\" Harris said, aiming to constantly stimulate our amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions such as fear and anxiety. This neurological manipulation was leading to dependence -- to people being literally addicted to social media apps. By influencing how we think about what we do, buy, and say, Harris said, technology is chipping away at our ability to freely make our own decisions. Personalized AI assistants will make these problems worse, wrapping us in the ultimate filter bubble, controlling the innumerable decisions that make up our lives. It will take concerted action by the companies building AI products, prodded by government regulation, to prevent this.\n\nMost tech companies train their chatbots to be agreeable, nonjudgmental, and \"helpful.\" The problem is that sometimes \"helpful\" isn't helpful. In an effort to be empathetic, chatbots can wind up confirming mistaken or biased beliefs. A fine line exists between friendship and enablement. Most of the best-known AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini will challenge users if they seem to be endorsing a well-known conspiracy theory, such as the idea that COVID-19 vaccines cause autism or the QAnon conspiracy. But on many controversial subjects, such as issues around Israel-Palestine or whether people should celebrate Columbus Day, the bots tend to respond with some variation of \"it's a complex and complicated topic with strong opinions on both sides.\"\n\nSome right-leaning politicians and technologists have accused the AI systems designed by the leading technology companies of being \"woke,\" and argued for the creation of AI models with explicit \"political personalities\" so that users can choose to interact with a chatbot that supports their viewpoints. Elon Musk has promised that his xAI research lab, which has built an LLM-based chatbot called Grok, will produce AI designed to be anti-woke. Such developments seem certain to further inflame the culture wars and provide little reason to hope that AI will do anything to counter filter bubbles.\n\nThe influence of chatbots, however, can be much more subtle than this: researchers at Cornell University found that using an AI assistant with a particular hidden viewpoint to help write an essay for or against a particular position subtly shifted the user's own views on that topic in the direction of the bias. Mor Naaman, the study's senior researcher, calls this \"latent persuasion\" and says \"you may not even know that you are being influenced.\" Trained from vast amounts of historical data, many LLMs harbor hidden racial or gender biases that could subtly shape their users' opinions -- for instance, an AI assistant for doctors that falsely believes that Black people have thicker skin or a higher pain threshold than white people.\n\nThe only way to combat this kind of hidden bias will be to mandate that tech companies reveal far more about how their AI models have been trained and allow independent auditing and testing. We must also insist on transparency from tech companies about the commercial incentives underlying their AI assistants. The Federal Trade Commission and other regulators should outlaw pay-to-play arrangements that would incentivize tech companies to have their chatbots recommend particular products, send traffic to certain websites, or endorse particular viewpoints. We should encourage business models, such as subscriptions, where the chatbot company has an unconflicted interest in serving the needs of its users, not the needs of its advertisers. When you need a new pair of running shoes and ask your AI personal assistant to research the options and buy the best pair for you, you want it to order the shoes that best suit your needs, not the ones from the brand that is paying the chatbot company the most to steer your business its way.\n\nYes, a chatbot that only tells you what you want to hear will reinforce filter bubbles. But we, as a society, could mandate that AI systems be designed to specifically pop these bubbles, asking people if they have considered alternative viewpoints and highlighting other perspectives. IBM built an AI called Project Debater that could hold its own against human debate champs on a range of topics, surfacing evidence in support of both sides of an argument. Regulators could mandate that AI chatbots aren't so nonjudgmental that they fail to challenge misinformed beliefs. We could even, in an effort to break down existing filter bubbles, require that chatbots surface alternative viewpoints and evidence.\n\nUltimately, the question is how much power do we want to continue to cede to a handful of large technology companies. What's at stake is ultimately our personal autonomy, our mental health, and society's cohesion.\n\nFrom MASTERING AI by Jeremy Kahn. Copyright \u00a9 2024 by Jeremy Kahn.

Thanks to that, many communities and demographic groups with fewer resources are being left without the talent, investments, and infrastructure needed for AI research and commercial scale-up.\n\nCentral to this challenge is the issue of what's called \"compute\" -- the infrastructural elements that drive digital systems and that have been a scarce resource for many researchers. As AI models grow increasingly complex and data-intensive, the infrastructure needed to train and run these models becomes prohibitively expensive, placing a significant financial strain on academic budgets. Even top-tier research universities are struggling to keep up with the escalating demand for and costs of computational resources. The situation is even more dire at smaller and underresourced institutions, where the issue is compounded by a shortage of AI expertise.\n\nAnd so federal agencies are working to create the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) aimed at democratizing AI research. The NAIRR is a proposed national initiative that aims to address many communities' and peoples' uneven access to AI-ready computing power, high-quality datasets, educational tools, and user support -- and narrow the gaps.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, the National Science Foundation (NSF) in January launched a pilot version of the NAIRR program as a proof-of-concept for the eventual establishment of a full-scale version of the program, with contributions from 12 other agencies and 26 industry partners. As part of the launch, the architects of the pilot announced its first \"allocation call:\" an opportunity for researchers to request access to advanced computing resources across six different computing facilities.\n\nAll of this is an important step toward addressing the access challenge. The pilot acknowledges and begins to push back against the inherent \"winner-take-most\" dynamics in the competition to build local AI research hubs. However, questions abound about the NAIRR's pilot's capacity to meaningfully advance geographic and demographic research inclusion on AI.\n\nCurrently, few of the core facilities participating in the pilot are providing state-of-the-art graphical processing units (GPUs) that are critical for training large language models (LLMs). Out of the more than 150 proposals that the pilot received, it was only able to award 35 projects in its first round of allocations. What's more, recent cuts to NSF's budget raise concerns about whether the NAIRR Pilot will be funded adequately. The fear, then, is that these efforts will not be enough to ameliorate an emerging AI research map that is highly skewed in favor of geographic and demographic communities that already have access to the technology.\n\nAll of this raises the question of what, exactly, the NAIRR Pilot should focus on as it refines the roles and activities of a longer-term, full-scale program. And here, two issues loom large.\n\nFirst, the cost of access to the resources needed to carry out foundational AI research has reached new extremes. As AI models scale up to achieve more general capabilities, the demand for compute for AI research has reached a scale unavailable to many academic institutions.\n\nThe gap in access to compute resources between industry and academia is increasingly pronounced. In January 2024, Meta announced plans to acquire 350,000 of NVIDIA's latest H100 GPUs by the end of the year. In contrast, one of the fastest supercomputers available for academic research, the Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is equipped with only about 27,000 V100 GPUs, which are already a generation older than Meta's H100s.\n\nThe problem with this is that the high costs and scarcity of state-of-the-art GPUs keep government actors and non-elite academic institutions from querying, fine-tuning, and training LLMs to develop their own advances. (The costs strain many \"elite\" institutions as well.) This limitation not only slows the pace of innovation within academic circles but may also affect the diversity of ideas and applications emerging from AI research.\n\nYet there's a second glaring challenge: equal access to compute resources does not always mean equal demographic participation in AI. In this vein, serious gaps remain in the availability of AI research and adoption skills at mid- and lower-tier research universities. Many of these institutions face basic shortages of tech skills, ranging from research scientists to technical support staff, a problem that can't be solved with more state-of-the-art GPUs.\n\nThis participation concern is especially acute at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), where there has been a historical underinvestment in computer science resources, program building, software development, and talent training. Researchers from these institutions, which are already underrepresented at the leading AI conferences, now risk falling behind in the widening AI divide.\n\nWithout the human capital for AI development, such as experienced faculty and research support staff, underresourced universities (and their regions) face significant barriers to entry. In light of this, the lack of training opportunities and local expertise will likely deepen geographic disparities in AI, concentrating development in already GPU-rich institutions.\n\nGiven these issues, a few initial outlines of how the NAIRR Pilot might help counter the emerging inequities of AI R&D can be envisioned.\n\nThe solution to the shortage of state-of-the-art compute resources in academia ultimately requires the acquisition or assembly of numerous large-scale GPU clusters. Cutting-edge AI research requires larger supplies of compute resources, but too few public institutions can afford the necessary infrastructure and energy. This means that the federal government needs to step up its investments in AI-suitable computational resources to close the most significant shortages of such resources and to meet related capability needs within academia. (Several bills in the Senate -- such as the CREATE AI Act and the Spectrum and National Security Act -- could prove helpful but appear unlikely to move this year.)\n\nThe NAIRR Pilot, meanwhile, has already demonstrated the appetite of the research community for GPUs in its first-round allocations, where most of the award recipients requested some GPU hours. However, at its current level of funding, the pilot can only address the compute issue by leveraging existing GPU resources to expand its allocations. In the short term, therefore, the pilot should facilitate wider access to the state-of-the-art computational resources available at various universities, regional facilities, and national labs. Moreover, the pilot should enable partnerships with these entities to make future opportunities such as research competitions and grants more accessible and visible to researchers.\n\nTo address the human capital challenge, meanwhile, there is no doubt that substantial investments in AI skills development are necessary. To be sure, neither the NAIRR Pilot nor any likely research resource will have the heft to close the talent inclusion gap by itself. Yet with that said, the NAIRR enterprise can play an important democratizing role by making its resources more accessible to underserved academic communities and by creating opportunities for low-resourced universities to build capacity.\n\nAt the root of the AI skills deficit resides an acute need for educational tools or resources that prepare students to engage in AI development. It's important, therefore, that the NAIRR makes strides in bringing compute resources to the classrooms, especially those that serve underrepresented groups. The pilot is already allocating GPU resources and interactive computing notebooks for educators to teach students foundational AI concepts. The NAIRR should expand on these resources, adding AI sandboxes and teaching kits (like one developed by NVIDIA) to the mix along with other envisioned software tools and tiered technical support. Without these resources, qualified AI talent will remain in short supply.\n\nEven outside of the classroom, the distribution of compute resources remains inequitable. A considerable proportion of the pilot's initial allocations were granted to large research universities, which wasn't surprising given the tight deadline for submissions. Larger, well-resourced universities that can move fast were destined to prosper under the pilot's first-come-first-served approach. But this leaves out smaller institutions without the bandwidth to prepare and submit competitive proposals. To accommodate these institutions, the pilot should reserve resources in anticipation of their submissions and even allocate a minimum amount of compute time to all applicants if possible. This would ensure that, by the time they apply for allocations, there will still be resources available.\n\nAdditionally, the NAIRR can create pathways for smaller institutions to tap into the knowledge and resources of the broader research community by encouraging cross-institutional collaboration. In this vein, the NAIRR Pilot should prioritize proposals with collaborators from different universities in the pilot's allocation process. To do this, the pilot could give selection preference to projects that demonstrate a meaningful and equitable partnerships across institutions. It could also issue specific calls for proposals that advance interdisciplinary research and that target areas that benefit from diverse inputs. This kind of collaboration facilitates the exchange of expertise and ideas, broadening the perspectives in and applications of AI research.\n\nPartnerships -- including one between Norfolk State University, the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, and the company Mainstay that developed a culturally responsive chatbot -- offer an additional blueprint for connecting researchers at different universities. This way, underresourced researchers can gain valuable experience, expand their professional networks, and increase their visibility through association with established research institutions. These researchers can also offer unique viewpoints that are typically drowned out in the tech space, ultimately enriching the research process and outcomes.\n\nWhile the NAIRR Pilot is just an initial step toward tackling AI access and participation concerns, it could well mark the beginning of a serious drive to address the nation's already-stark geographic and demographic disparities in AI research. Supporting AI researchers in academia will necessarily involve more than funding research activities. Realizing the full vision of the NAIRR to this end will clearly require building and sustaining both the technical and human infrastructure that underpins these scientific endeavors.

A recent effort from Colorado lawmakers is one of the first to cross the finish line.\n\n(SB24-205) was signed into law by Colorado Governor Jared Polis in May and focuses on \"high-risk AI systems\" that are classified in the bill's text as \"systems that, when deployed, make, or are a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision.\" One example of a consequential decision is the approval or denial of a financial or lending service.\n\nUnder the new legislation, developers are required to take \"reasonable care\" to protect consumers from the risks of algorithmic discrimination. They must disclose intricate details about the systems as well as documentation needed for conducting impact assessments to deployers of their products. Developers need to also publish a publicly-available statement outlining the various systems in operation and how risks of algorithmic discrimination are managed.\n\n\"This bill is among the first in the country to attempt to regulate the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry on such a scale. ... I appreciate the sponsors' interest in preventing discrimination and prioritizing consumer protection as Colorado leads this space,\" Polis said in a May . A was introduced in Connecticut in February, but failed to be signed into law.\n\nThe bill requires deployers across the state to implement a risk management policy and program for high-risk systems, conduct an impact assessment of the systems, annually review each system's deployment to check for algorithmic biases and more.\n\nCompanies that deploy AI models will need to alert the state Attorney General to any instances of discrimination that are uncovered within 90 days. If they are in compliance with a recognized risk management framework and have taken actions to discover and correct such violations, the legislation gives them the right to raise an affirmative defense that could, if granted, negate any legal consequences.\n\nDisclosures such as those made to the Attorney General, in addition to appeal processes, are key parts of the legislation. Deployers will need to provide consumers with opportunities to both correct personal data used in decisions made by high-risk systems and appeal (when feasible) adverse decisions.\n\nThe changes are set to go into full effect on Feb. 1, 2026.\n\n\"The goal was always to try to balance consumer protections with innovation,\" said Sen. Robert Rodriguez, D-Colo., who was a prime sponsor of the bill. \"[AI] is new, it's cool, it's neat and we all like it, but it's got problems.\"\n\nTraditional AI had been front of mind for many banking executives as the fueled a tech boom across the financial services industry in 2020. But the debut of two years later saw interest shift towards large language models able to both execute predetermined tasks and create wholly-new results.\n\nreleased in March by Arizent, the publisher of American Banker, polled 127 banking experts across the industry. More than 45% of respondents said they are either using or likely to use generative AI to help improve general office productivity, with 36% also incorporating the technology into fraud prevention and detection.\n\nWhile consumer protection was the prime focus of the bill, other sponsors said they tried to draft it in such a way as to not hinder innovation in the state.\n\nRep. Brianna Titone, D-Colo., said including elements of transparency and working with tech companies to help sculpt the legislation was crucial to help set a proper balance between overregulation and lack of oversight.\n\n\"We have a lot of companies using AI in Colorado, and the last thing we want to do is stifle innovation of the companies that are doing a lot of great work. ... It's about trying to balance the negative unintended consequences of AI with that innovation,\" Titone said.\n\nBank regulators have expressed differing views on the need for new laws to govern AI. In September, the issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in underwriting and the explanations given to consumers who are denied credit. The bureau said that creditors must provide specific reasons and details to explain why a consumer is denied credit or why a credit limit was changed, regardless of whether the decision was made by AI.\n\nIn January, officials with the said they have the tools to make banks that use AI comply with existing rules.\n\nFinancial institutions and fintech firms alike have called for increased clarity into what the impact to their industries could look like, but by and large felt prepared for any new compliance guidelines due to operating in an already highly-regulated environment.\n\nLegal experts specializing in this technology say that when adopting AI-powered tools, recordkeeping and audit reviews are a best practice and in some cases a requirement due to the complexity of the models.\n\n\"One message is clear from new laws and enforcement: ignorance of an AI system's operation is not an excuse, and regulators like the Federal Trade Commission are holding both the developers and users of AI technologies responsible for their effects,\" said James Sherer, partner at BakerHostetler and co leader of the firm's emerging technology and AI teams.\n\nAlongside Colorado's new bill, lawmakers in the state have passed another measure to comprised of four legislative members and 22 industry figures that represent entities from the AI industry. This group will help draft recommendations for further regulations and establish a code of conduct for evaluating the impact of AI usage in the state.\n\nThe path of innovation going forward is uncertain and will vary widely depending on each use case.\n\n\"We are likely to see some form of tollgate approach, where low risk use cases are encouraged with minimal oversight, moderate risk use cases receive increased scrutiny, transparency and reporting and high-risk use cases involving substantial or fundamental rights [are subject to] strict requirements and in certain cases, prohibitions,\" said Joel Wuesthoff, managing director at the global consulting firm Protiviti.", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Banker"}, "authors":

Only a small fraction found enough precious metal to make the trip worthwhile.\n\nOf course, the California gold rush created a thriving secondary market for prospecting gear. As hundreds of thousands of people dug fruitlessly in the state's streams and riverbeds, the businesses selling them shovels enjoyed success beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nNow, California is providing the setting for another gold rush. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, OpenAI, the AI start-up behind ChatGPT, has forever changed the world of technology and, following a tender offer reported on by the New York Times earlier this year, the still-private company is valued at around $80bn. This figure makes OpenAI more valuable than a host of Big Tech giants, including the likes of Spotify and Snap.\n\nBut ChatGPT is only the beginning. The AI revolution's first golden nugget has spawned dreams of countless more; more advanced programs, specialised applications and flashier platforms that promise to make ambitious developers and start-ups inconceivably rich. Some of these aspiring pioneers will no doubt be successful. However, the smart money says that many, many more will see their dreams go down in flames.\n\nThat's not the end of the story, though. As long as the AI bubble continues to inflate, the providers of the secondary products and services that facilitate their development will be able to line their pockets. While Silicon Valley's idealistic prospectors dig up the land in search of precious metal, established players in the hardware market will make a fortune selling them shovels.\n\nIs AI living up to the hype?\n\n\"We decided to incorporate a highly rated AI-based legal research tool into our operations, and I was among the advocates for this approach,\" says Andy Gillin, attorney and managing partner at GJEL Accident Attorneys in California. \"The output was initially impressive, but our enthusiasm for it waned as we began to see the gaps.\n\n\"After several months, it became quite clear that while the tool had potential, its execution fell short of our firm's requirements. Our team began to rely more heavily again on traditional legal research methods.\"\n\nJon Morgan, CEO of consulting firm Venture Smarter, experimented with an AI-powered predictive analytics tool, and was also disappointed with the ultimate outcome. \"Trends and market conditions can shift quickly in our business. Unfortunately, the AI models we employed weren't able to effectively capture these nuances or adjust their predictions accordingly. As a result, the insights provided by the platform didn't offer the level of accuracy and reliability we needed to make informed decisions.\"\n\nGillin and Morgan's stories echo those of other business leaders who have already hopped on and off the AI bandwagon. I spoke with managers who experimented with automated customer service chatbots, content generators, customer relationship managers and fitness instructors. The platforms my interviewees tried looked impressive and were useful to some degree. However, when push came to shove, many were simply unable to replicate human-level work. None of the individuals I spoke to were able to replace a human employee with an AI tool.\n\nOf course, if you're seeking financial gain as an innovator in tech, you don't always need concrete results. Apparent potential will often do just fine. This wouldn't be the first time that widespread hype in the tech industry has ended in tears; the dot-com boom and bust of the early 21st century provides us with useful precedents to consider.\n\nPets.com, an online pet supplies store, raised $82.5m in its initial public offering in 2000 before filing for bankruptcy just nine months later. Online grocery delivery firm Webvan imploded even more dramatically, folding in 2001 after reaching a $1.2bn valuation in 1999.\n\nThe holes in these companies' business models might be glaringly obvious now, but - as is typical in bubble economies - many investors failed to see the warning signs until it was too late. Given the meteoric rise of AI over the last while, it seems inevitable that we'll see more stories like this in the coming years.\n\nWill the boom keep on booming?\n\nThe big question is how much automation AI will be able to bring about. In April 2023, a Goldman Sachs report estimated that 300m human jobs could be taken over by generative AI; while there have been some reports of AI-related job losses over the intervening 12 months, it appears we're still a long way away from obsolescence on that grand scale.\n\nSo, should we just be patient? Should we expect the skyward trend in the capability of AI models to continue indefinitely? According to Dr Ruairi O'Reilly, lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Munster Technological University, probably not.\n\n\"LLMs are inherently limited by the data they've been trained on and this hasn't really been acknowledged,\" says O'Reilly. So, even programs that are clearly useful (such as ChatGPT) may be nearing the ceiling of what they can achieve in the near future.\n\nThen, there's the energy problem. \"As these models get larger and larger, they need more computing power,\" says O'Reilly. \"So, at a certain point, the efficiency of larger models will be outpaced by the costs associated with training them.\"\n\nIn fact, computing capacity and storage have been standing in the way of AI's progress for decades. Neural networks, the machine-learning processes standing behind much of the current machine learning infrastructure, were invented in the 1990s; however, it was \"only when computing power and storage became cheap with the advent of cloud computing that they became feasible,\" O'Reilly points out.\n\nThis speaks to the phenomenon of 'AI winters'. The level of interest (and investment) in artificial intelligence has ebbed and flowed since the invention of the computer; bursts of rapid growth in the space have repeatedly been followed by long periods of low engagement.\n\nO'Reilly believes that productivity enhancement is a field in which AI innovators are poised to make huge leaps in the near future. He points to Fin, a chatbot program released by Intercom, that has had a lot of success handling customer queries without human intervention. \"Programs like these will allow companies to use automated workflows that keep humans in the loop. This is likely to be an area of significant growth, where real productivity gains can be realised.\"\n\nThere's a problem, though. If the market lurches downward due to another loss of confidence, potential success stories like this could falter, simply because of unfortunate timing. While we're currently in the midst of a scorching AI summer, this isn't necessarily a good thing for the industry in the long run.\n\n\"I would be worried that if a big company failed, it would cause contagion; they could fall like a house of cards,\" says O'Reilly. \"This could stymie innovation by companies that are actually making gains and providing value to their customers.\"\n\nWho's making the money in AI now?\n\nWhile LLMs have made us more efficient, they haven't quite turned the world of work on its head. If historical trends are anything to go by, the automation of the working world could take decades, rather than years.\n\nHowever, there can be no denial of the eye-watering amounts of money changing hands to keep the current AI juggernaut on the road. As noted, OpenAI has been the biggest winner on the software side of things, but even greater gains have been made in the hardware space.\n\nNvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to train and run programs like ChatGPT, posted stock-price gains of over 241pc in 2023, making it the best-performing security on the S&P 500 for the year. Its $2trn valuation makes it the third-biggest company in the world as of April 2024.\n\nMoreover, the company is likely to maintain this success \"as long as GPUs remain the dominant force behind the training of models,\" says O'Reilly. Nvidia controls around 95pc of the GPU market at present, and the demand for these chips will keep growing as long as developers continue training increasingly advanced machine-learning applications.\n\nNvidia's isn't the only semiconductor company to perform strongly of late. AMD (which lists Meta and Microsoft as clients) has also made astounding progress, tripling its market capitalisation between January 2023 and February 2024. Intel has also posted gains.\n\nThese industry giants have erected significant barriers to entry into the computer hardware space. The initial investment for a newcomer would be massive and much of the key intellectual property is patent-protected.\n\nThe hardware demands of artificial intelligence don't begin and end with chips. Memory storage facilities, data centres, cooling systems and networking equipment have all become more important of late as well.\n\nCrucially, many of the market gains in the hardware space have been backed by huge revenue streams. Nvidia's revenue report for the final quarter of fiscal year 2023 marked an increase of 265pc over the same period in 2022. These companies aren't just growing on the back of raw speculation; they're being fuelled by fat wads of cash.\n\nSo, while a cooling AI market will hurt hardware giants, they've already made plenty of hay beneath the still-shining sun. Semiconductors and data centres were around long before the current AI bull run, and they'll still be here well after it ends.\n\nThe glints in the riverbed\n\nSo, what does the future hold? Valuable products and services will always attract demand, and there is clearly plenty of value in AI. Though there were a lot of expensive losers during the dot-com bust, there were also companies (Amazon, for example) with solid foundations that weathered the storm and became industry giants in the years that followed. OpenAI appears to be walking this path already, and others will surely follow.\n\nHowever, the landscape is treacherous and uncertain. When the next AI winter settles in, it will freeze out many nascent players in the space. The hardware providers who have already made billions selling metaphorical shovels are much less likely to be left in the cold.\n\nBy Francis Walshe\n\nFrancis Walshe is a freelance writer focusing mainly on legal, business and tech stories.

In contrast, only 11% said there would be more firms charging by the hour, and 30% said it would be about the same.\n\nA big part of this is because professionals predict the number of hours to do things will likely fall as firms become more familiar with AI. Poll respondents right now work an average of 46 hours a week. Thomson Reuters found that, with the predicted pace of AI adoption, respondents expect to free up four hours a week in the next year; eight hours a week in three years; and 12 hours a week in five years. In such a case, continuing to charge by the hour may be challenging.\n\n\"The future of professional services lies in embracing value-based pricing,\" said he report. \"As AI transforms work processes, firms must develop models that reflect their true value to clients. This shift moves away from traditional hourly rates to pricing structures that capture the efficiency, expertise, and innovation AI enables.\"\n\nWhat do professionals plan to do with all this extra time? According to the poll, the top answer is to relax. Or, more specifically, \"work-life balance/well-being/hobbies/rest,\" cited by 24% of poll respondents. The proportion was even higher for those who work in tax and accounting firms: 34%. This is in contrast to those who work for law firms, who said they want more time for business development and marketing tasks, corporate accountants, who want more time to seek improved efficiency and perform strategic work and planning, and those in government agencies, who said they would likely devote more time to core tasks and long-term projects.\n\nThis is despite predictions that AI will also lead to more work being done in-house versus outsourced to other companies. Thomson Reuters found 33% of professionals believe AI will lead to more work being done in-house versus the 19% who say the opposite; 36% think it will remain about the same. At the same time, when work is outsourced to another company, 29% of professionals predict this work will become more valuable versus 22% who think it will be less. It appears that professionals believe AI will allow companies to bring in the lower value tasks they may have outsourced previously (e.g., accounts receivable), while paying more for the highly specialized tasks that they'd outsource.\n\n\"In-house departments are striving to shed the 'cost center' label, leveraging AI to handle routine tasks and focus on more complex, strategic work. Concurrently, external advisors will continue to offer specialized experience and high-stakes advisory services. This shift in work types allows in-house teams to enhance their strategic leadership while still relying on firms for critical expertise,\" said the report.\n\nThomson Reuters also rated professionals' opinion on generative AI outputs. Overall, professionals seem to think AI is OK -- not great, but not terrible. Only 7% said the outputs were poor, while 50% said they were a basic starting point. Only 4% said that generative AI produces outputs better than anything they could have come up with themselves.\n\n\"Respondents said they feel that AI can provide a basic starting point, but in most cases, professionals will still need to take the lead,\" said the report.", "source": {"uri": "accountingtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Accounting Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounts_receivable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounts receivable"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ed48b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5159x2902+5+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Fbe%2F436a212b4b74a6015f748b6a3cd1%2Fadobestock-516953201.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Artificial intelligence is your new assistant to combat cybercrime; a powerful tool for enhancing the capacity of threat detection through foreseeing, recognizing and nullifying cyber threats with unmatched speed and efficiency. It can enable organizations to switch from a reactive cybersecurity strategy to a proactive one. This assists in staying ahead of malicious actors who constantly enhance their methods for bypassing defenses.\n\nMachine learning, particularly when applied to historical data, can help with cyber threat detection. These models are capable of recognizing patterns and abnormalities that human analysts might not immediately notice. For example, a system based on AI can acquire understanding from the information passing through a network. This allows it to adjust itself to new dangers as they appear. It also implies that it can discover a zero-day malware attack, which is an event that no current software has met with.\n\nAdditionally, AI models are not fixed. This means that they grow and improve upon their intelligence from each interaction that happens. Businesses can combine these models with their current setups to add an extra layer of alertness. This also readily supports the existing skills of cybersecurity squads, guaranteeing that they are able to react more accurately to threats even with reduced human monitoring.\n\nAnother AI capability that is changing cyber threat detection, and phishing in particular, is Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP techniques are great for spotting phishing attacks hidden in texts or emails where the evil intention is not as clear. Through NLP, it becomes possible to examine the language and arrangement of communications to find content that carries subtle hints of phishing or fraud.\n\nA seemingly harmless email that asks for resetting your password might be carefully examined by NLP algorithms to identify signs of urgency or fear, which are frequently used in cybercrime techniques. Additionally, NLP is very useful in regulatory compliance. It helps to make sure that communications inside a company follow the law and other rules. Using NLP for monitoring messages coming in and going out can help companies prevent data leaks, but also keep them safe from legal problems due to non-compliance with regulations.\n\nBringing AI into play with incident response can boost an organization's capacity to quickly and efficiently respond to threats. Systems powered by AI have the ability to automatically start responses like isolating infected devices or shutting down network connection of hacked accounts faster than human teams. This automation lessens the harm a breach can make and lightens the amount of load on cybersecurity staff.\n\nAlong with responding to incidents, AI can also aid in the field of forensic analysis. It can assist teams in comprehending the path through which a breach happened and offer knowledge to prevent similar future events. This active method not just protects an organization but also educates and readies it against changing cyber dangers, making its structure strong and less likely to be attacked in the long run.\n\nArtificial Intelligence's real-time monitoring is extremely critical for identifying and taking action against threats as they happen. Unlike the conventional method of scanning at intervals, AI systems analyze data in an ongoing manner which provides instant detection of unusual activities. This feature becomes very important in a landscape where attackers frequently modify their strategies to dodge security standards.\n\nAI can also locate dangers that humans might not be able to detect, because it has the capacity to examine enormous volumes of information in real time. For instance, a slight alteration in the pattern of network traffic could mean someone is trying to steal data from a computer system. AI might notice such changes immediately and stop any further action straight away. This prompt response helps protect against continuous but unnoticeable attempts to steal sensitive information.\n\nAI systems greatly improve threat intelligence by gathering and examining information from different origins whether it is public databases, dark web scans or internal logs. This holistic view helps AI better recognize growing threats and identify malicious individuals. It can also help detect trends or repetitive behaviors that suggest a planned attack, allowing time to prepare or modify organization defense strategies accordingly. The inclusion of AI in the threat intelligence system not only makes it faster but also offers the option to engage with deeper analysis that isn't possible through the use of human resources alone.\n\nArtificial Intelligence the ability to help with compliance and auditing, which are usually slow and prone to mistakes due to human involvement. Automated intelligence systems can check if a company's activities follow the rules and standards of its industry as well as regulations, without requiring additional manpower. This helps ensure ongoing compliance while also freeing resources to deal with other threats or responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, AI can conduct these checks more often and precisely compared to human teams. Businesses that process huge quantities of delicate information like health care or finance require AI-powered compliance tools to keep their activities within lawful limits and preserve customer confidence.\n\nFor Artificial Intelligence systems to work well, continuous training and updates are very important. Cybersecurity is an area where opponents are always changing their tactics, so we need AI models to adjust accordingly. Frequent training sessions using fresh and growing threat information guarantee that intelligence tools stay keen and efficient.\n\nBy keeping the AI algorithms fresh through latest developments in AI research, you attain leverage over cyber-criminals. Making such investments improves the effectiveness and lifespan of AI tools as well, further making them a sensible choice for safeguarding against future cybersecurity threats.\n\nAI systems and tools are not the only ones that should be updated or trained, make sure that human staff and workers are well equipped with the knowledge of security protocols. Conduct workshops and tests to ensure that your employees are as skilled as the systems you use. With the combined power of human wit and AI, you can ensure that no harm comes to your reputation or business assets.\n\nUsing AI for cyber threat detection is not just a luxury, but more of a requirement. As criminals get smarter, the proactive and flexible protection that AI offers becomes crucial for businesses to safeguard their assets. To improve cybersecurity in your organization, you should apply each of the strategies discussed above. This will help you stay on top of changing cyber threats and make your system stronger against possible attacks.", "source": {"uri": "techiexpert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techiexpert.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Threat (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-day (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyber threat intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.techiexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cyber-Threat-Detection-Using-AI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is leading the charge by embracing artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, to revolutionize its internal operations and consulting services. Let's delve into how BCG is leveraging AI to transform its business processes and the consulting industry as a whole.\n\nAI is not just a buzzword at BCG; it is a fundamental element of their strategy. Vlad Lukic, Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG, emphasizes the significance of AI, stating, \"It gets into the crux of our business, right? And it's going to be fundamental to the toolkit and skills that we need to have.\" AI serves as an assistant, enabling BCG consultants to operate at unprecedented speeds, thus allowing them to generate insights faster and drive impactful results for their clients.\n\n1. Interview Processing and Analysis:\n\nLukic recalls his summer internship, where he had to interview 30 engineers about materials science over three days, transcribe the conversations, distill the insights, and create slides. This labor-intensive process took two weeks. In contrast, a recent consultant used BCG's enterprise GPT to perform a similar task. \"On the third day, he had slides and insights ready to go,\" Lukic marvels. The AI tool transcribed interviews, highlighted key themes, and generated draft presentations in minutes, reducing a two-week process to two or three days.\n\n2. Gene: BCG's Innovative Conversational AI:\n\nAnother striking example of AI's impact at BCG is the development of Gene, a conversational AI designed to engage with humans and create audio experiences. Originally conceived as a co-host for BCG's \"Imagine This\" podcast about the future, Gene has evolved into a versatile tool for client engagement and content creation.\n\nPaul Michelman, editor-in-chief at BCG, explains, \"Gene was born for a specific job, really one job, and its original training was to be a co-host of a podcast.\" However, the potential of Gene quickly became apparent, and its applications have expanded. Gene now appears at live events with clients and other audiences, engaging in conversations about the future of AI and thought leadership.\n\nBCG's enterprise GPT is a cornerstone of their AI strategy. Rolled out to every employee, this tool ensures all data remains within BCG's control. Consultants can also build their own GPTs for specific engagements, fostering innovation and efficiency. Over 3,000 GPTs have been created, addressing tasks from document summarization to administrative functions. Lukic highlights its impact on productivity, noting, \"It's really helping us move to a different level of speed.\"\n\nWith AI taking over routine tasks, the role of consultants is evolving. Lukic underscores the need for purposeful toil and sanity checks to ensure junior consultants develop essential skills. He explains, \"We are forcing some of those conversations with our team members, so that we can build their skills along the way.\" This includes teaching consultants how to engage with AI tools effectively, ensuring they can provide accurate and reliable insights.\n\nThe development of Gene has also prompted new considerations in AI deployment. Bill Moore from BCG Design Studios, who created Gene, explains the challenges in balancing autonomy and control: \"We adjust, we work with the temperature to keep that sort of fine-tuned and we'll drop it down to zero if we need really accurate responses.\"\n\nBCG conducted a scientific experiment involving 750 employees to measure the impact of generative AI on performance and efficiency. The results were compelling. For straightforward tasks, productivity increased by 30-40% for new hires and 20-30% for experienced consultants. However, for complex tasks, productivity sometimes decreased due to the challenges of debugging AI-generated outputs. This experiment highlighted the importance of understanding where AI can be most effective and implementing proper guardrails to ensure accuracy.\n\nBCG's broader research into generative AI reveals significant insights into its value and potential pitfalls. The study found that around 90% of participants improved their performance when using GenAI for creative ideation. However, when applied to business problem-solving -- a task outside the tool's current competence -- many participants trusted misleading outputs, resulting in a 23% decline in performance compared to those who didn't use the tool. This underscores the necessity of proper training and understanding the limitations of AI tools.\n\nTo mitigate risks associated with AI, BCG has implemented several guardrails. Human experts review AI-generated insights, and workflows are designed to ensure continuous oversight. Additionally, BCG fine-tunes their models based on usage and feedback, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\nIn the case of Gene, transparency and ethical considerations are paramount. Paul Michelman emphasizes, \"We think it's very important... to be fully clear when we're using technology. And two, to really avoid anthropomorphizing.\" This approach extends to Gene's voice, which is intentionally androgynous and slightly robotic to clearly differentiate it from a human.\n\nBCG employs a dual approach to AI implementation. While top-down initiatives identify key workflows that can benefit from AI, grassroots innovation is also encouraged. A senior task force focuses on internal support functions and consulting cohorts, identifying where AI can eliminate bottlenecks and enhance productivity.\n\nLooking ahead, AI is poised to reshape the consulting industry. Lukic predicts that within a decade, 50% of current tasks will be automated through AI, allowing consultants to focus more on change management and driving adoption within client organizations.\n\nBill Moore envisions a future where conversational interfaces like Gene become a new layer of interaction with technology, potentially revolutionizing accessibility and user experience.\n\nFor CEOs considering AI adoption, Lukic offers two key pieces of advice. First, don't wait. Start addressing frictions and building the necessary governance structures now. Second, engage the organization. Avoid outsourcing AI implementation entirely and instead, focus on building internal capabilities.\n\nBCG's strategic application of AI, particularly generative AI and conversational AI like Gene, showcases how embracing technology can revolutionize internal processes and enhance client service. By leveraging AI tools like enterprise GPT and Gene, BCG is boosting productivity, fostering innovation, and preparing its workforce for the future. As AI continues to evolve, BCG's proactive approach provides a valuable blueprint for other organizations aiming to harness the power of AI in their own operations.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BCG vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Consulting_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Consulting Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transcription (linguistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Materials science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic summarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(creative_process)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideation (creative process)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top-down and bottom-up design"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668e1ea0b600507b0454f2f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

While much has been said about some of the clinical applications of generative AI - such as in interpreting scans - there are many more routine tasks where it could be used to improve efficiency and reduce the impact of staff shortages.\n\nAn HSJ webinar, in association with Microsoft, sought to tease out where trusts could most benefit from adopting generative AI and how they should go about it.\n\nOne of the trusts which have been at the forefront of using generative AI is Imperial College Healthcare Trust. However, while Imperial has been developing and evaluating the use of generative AI in clinical areas such as radiology, imaging and pathology, it has also been looking at how it could support efficiencies in areas such as administration and other back office functions.\n\nErik Mayer, clinical reader, Imperial College London, and a consultant surgeon at both Imperial and the Royal Marsden, said one of the successes had been in using natural language processing to look at unstructured data and free text narratives such as patient feedback. Generative AI could analyse themes and sentiments from these in 15 minutes whereas a human would take six to eight days.\n\n\"What that means is people can then use that information to drive quality improvement initiatives that are patient-derived,\" he said. \"The staff get to see all the positive things that patients say about them when often they only hear about the negative things.\"\n\nOther applications included using unstructured analysis to look at recruitment processes to ensure that the trust was compliant with the EDI agenda and how discharge summaries could be tailored for patients in multiple languages. He added that around 80 per cent of information within Imperial's electronic health record was free text.\n\nFor Malte Gerhold, director of innovation and improvement at the Health Foundation, demographic changes made looking at technology vital. Making use of the data the NHS has offers an opportunity to improve care - and generative AI is a powerful tool to understand and analyse that data, he added.\n\nBut he urged realism about what could happen and when. \"I don't think the AI doctor will see us anytime soon. I don't think it'll revolutionise healthcare in the next two, three, four or five years,\" he said.\n\nMr Gerhold explained that much of the focus of generative AI at the moment was around the areas where there was a lot of data but that work was required in the areas that had less well-curated data, of poorer quality and consistency.\n\nBut the biggest challenge would be how to change ways of working and culture. Announcements by chancellor Jeremy Hunt around investment in IT had focused on the kit with no mention of investment in change capacity, he added.\n\n\"We know that even across introducing electronic patient records, it's one thing to have them, it's another one to change the ways of working on top of them, whether clinical or non-clinical, and that requires staff that requires analysts, et cetera,\" he said.\n\nOne concern often raised about AI was that it could inhibit empathy and the use of emotional intelligence - and that may make some in the NHS more reluctant to adopt it\n\nBut what will make the difference for trusts who want to make use of generative AI? Anna Dijkstra, director of innovation for healthcare and life sciences at Microsoft, said the organisations she saw which seemed to be progressing in the use of AI had some common characteristics.\n\nOne was executive and clinical sponsorship which helped to focus the organisation on the biggest challenges. These organisations also needed to have quality data and bring together domain experts to figure out what the \"core use\" cases were and how to address them.\n\nKnowing where to start can be hard; she recommended looking at, first, the technical complexity to implement, and second, the value it creates for the organisation.\n\n\"Starting small can help your IT staff get more familiar with the technology and also help your clinical staff and others understand the technology and its potential a little bit better as you progress towards more complex use cases,\" she said. Help was available from Microsoft and others for trusts which wanted to take those first steps, she said.\n\nOne concern often raised about AI was that it could inhibit empathy and the use of emotional intelligence - and that may make some in the NHS more reluctant to adopt it. Mr Mayer said that trust was really important and arose from engaging and co-designing with patients and the community.\n\nMr Gerhold added: \"It's quite easy to say 'oh technology is all about productivity, efficiency, process'. But a lot of the aspects of those problems are also about the quality of care and the experience of patients. And in a lot of those areas, there's great opportunity.\"\n\nFreeing up time from admin could mean clinicians were able to engage more with patients and could mean their experience of care improved, he said. \"We may just help them to have a slightly better conversation and more human conversation with the patient, which will not show in any productivity statistics and that is okay.\"\n\nMs Dijkstra pointed out how generative AI could adapt information to match the reading age of the patient or deliver it in a different language - giving them information they could understand and use.\n\nBut with so much work going on in generative AI, she saw a problem arising with different organisations developing their solutions independently. \"I would love to see a centre of excellence where different organisations are sharing all these different use cases they're creating,\" she added.\n\nSo, what would the panellists' advice be to a trust thinking about dipping its toe in the water of generative AI? Mr Mayer said there were several challenges to be worked through but the most obvious areas to focus on were in non-clinical operational administration and were less risky because they were not directly involved with patient care. This could help mature thinking and provide an evidence base before uses closer to patient care were tried.\n\nMr Gerhold urged listeners to think about what problems they wanted to solve, to look at what others had done and then have a conversation with staff.\n\nAnd Ms Dijkstra suggested that anybody interested in exploring GenAI use cases, potentially through hackathons or skilling, to reach out to technology partners like Microsoft, or to Imperial to learn about their experience with effective governance and implementation.\n\nIf you had previously registered as a viewer for the event, you will be able to view the recording immediately.", "source": {"uri": "hsj.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Health Service Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_moore@hsj.co.uk", "name": "Alison Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_Healthcare_NHS_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consultant (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic health record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edsger W.

As of March, more than half of these received approval from Chinese authorities for public release.\n\nFaced with a saturated domestic market, more Chinese app developers are now setting their sights on Western markets, including the US.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that Chinese AI apps have swiftly gained traction in the US, particularly in the education sector. Applications like Question.AI, owned by Beijing-based educational technology startup Zuoyebang and ByteDance's Gauth, are revolutionising how American students tackle their homework by providing instant solutions and explanations through advanced AI algorithms.\n\nFor context, Question.AI and Gauth are popular educational apps that use generative AI to help US students in various subjects. Users can photograph homework problems to receive solutions with step-by-step explanations. Question.AI launched in mid-2023, while Gauth (originally Gauthmath) started in 2020 as a math solver before expanding. Both offer free essential use with paid additional features. As of recent rankings, Gauth is the second most popular educational app globally, with Question.AI at seventh.\n\nThis convenience has resonated with students and parents, offering a seamless blend of technology and education that complements the increasingly digital learning environment. Initially designed for China's vast and competitive market, these apps began bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities to American classrooms. After all, with its high digital adoption rates and openness to educational innovation, the US market presents a lucrative opportunity for Chinese developers looking to expand their user base beyond domestic borders.\n\nAccording to mobile app intelligence service AppMagic, Question.AI and Gauth, generative AI-driven homework helpers, were ranked among the top three free educational apps in the US on Apple's iOS store and Google Play from February to May.\n\nAI in education: Domestic pressure driving global expansion\n\nIn China, the development of large language models has been prolific. With over 200 such models created, the competition among AI developers is intense. This high-stakes environment has driven many companies to seek growth opportunities abroad. The approval of these models for public release by Chinese authorities signifies the maturity and readiness of these technologies for broader application, encouraging developers to explore international markets.\n\nThis push for global expansion is not just about finding new revenue streams but also about gaining a competitive edge and establishing a global presence. For Chinese AI companies, breaking into Western markets, particularly the US, symbolises commercial success and technological leadership on a global scale.\n\nThe adoption of Chinese AI apps in the US education sector also illustrates some strategic advantages these tools possess. The sophisticated AI technology in Question.AI and Gauth delivers individual-learnt experiences. In the US, educators appreciate such granularity as they are committed to personalised instruction for students with various learning styles.\n\nMoreover, the flexibility and accessibility of these AI tools align well with the digital transformation sweeping through American education. Given that the pandemic has expedited online learning, AI-powered educational apps stand to bridge this gap in traditional teaching methodologies by providing timely help and improving their delivery methods.\n\nNavigating challenges: Data privacy and cultural integration\n\nEven with their technological prowess, Chinese AI apps will be met by data privacy and security concerns when entering US markets. There will be increased oversight on how these apps manage user data, especially in light of the geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Ensuring compliance with stringent US data privacy regulations is crucial for gaining user trust and widespread acceptance.\n\nAdditionally, cultural integration poses another hurdle. Chinese educational philosophies often emphasise rote learning and discipline, which may contrast with American education's focus on creativity and critical thinking. Successfully blending these approaches to create a holistic learning experience will be essential to the sustained success of these apps in the US.\n\nUltimately, the success of Chinese AI apps like Question.AI and Gauth in the US clearly demonstrates the advanced technological capabilities that have been developed through intense domestic competition. As these companies continue to navigate the complexities of entering the Western market, their impact on the future of education is expected to expand.\n\nExplore other upcoming enterprise technology events and webinars powered by TechForge here.", "source": {"uri": "artificialintelligence-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AI News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dashveenjit_kaur@artificialintelligence-news.com", "name": "Dashveenjit Kaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South China Morning Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rote learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy of Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/openai-common-sense-media-family-ai-artificial-intelligence-education.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

From the advent of personal computers in the 1970s to the introduction of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, followed by the emergence of smartphones, social media, and cloud computing in the 2000s, recent decades have seen significant shifts in how we work. And now, in the 2020s, the latest transformational force appears to be artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe field of AI research dates to the 1950s but has blossomed in recent years. Machine learning algorithms are now integrated into various products and services, including product recommendations, fraud detection, and self-driving vehicles. Recently, the development of generative AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini has enabled users to interact with sophisticated chatbots and generate text or images based on prompts. For many, these innovations have shifted AI from a science fiction concept to a practical tool for work and creative pursuits.\n\nThe number of AI patent filings has increased exponentially in recent years\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Center for Security and Emerging Technology data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nBeyond the well-known products and media attention, progress in AI is further demonstrated by the surge in research and development. According to Stanford University's 2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report, AI-related patent filings have increased exponentially, from approximately 3,500 in 2010 to over 190,000 in 2022. Similarly, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled over the same period, rising from around 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 by 2022.\n\nThis extensive research has led to rapid improvements in AI performance across various competencies. For example, the most advanced AI systems now outperform humans in image, language, handwriting, and speech recognition, as well as language understanding and reading comprehension. As of last year, these models nearly matched human performance on predictive reasoning tests, heightening concerns about the potential impact of AI on the workforce.\n\nNearly 9% of workers have high AI exposure & high automation risk\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013) data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nWith the proliferation of AI-related research and new AI-enabled technologies, computers now have the potential to disrupt many industries and occupations previously believed to be insulated from automation. Historically, jobs at the highest risk of computerized automation involved repetitive, low-complexity tasks, such as those performed by assembly line workers or farm laborers. However, the range of workers at risk of job displacement has now broadened.\n\nOne useful way to understand AI's impact on the labor force is to classify occupations based on their degree of AI exposure -- how integral AI is predicted to be in their field -- and the probability of computerized automation. For instance, professions like lawyers, CEOs, and civil engineers might rely on AI to enhance decision-making but face low probabilities of being completely automated. These high-AI-exposure, low-automation-risk professions make up an estimated 16% of the U.S. workforce.\n\nConversely, occupations with both high AI exposure and high risk of automation include loan officers, accountants, and paralegals, whose tasks and knowledge can be more easily learned and replicated by AI systems. These roles account for an estimated 9% of all workers nationally.\n\nThe majority of occupations, about 75% of total employment, are unlikely to be significantly impacted by AI but may face other types of automation risks. Jobs such as farm laborers or fast food cooks can be automated using non-AI-based computerized machines. Workers who face both low AI exposure and low risk of automation include highly hands-on professionals like dancers, firefighters, and plumbers.\n\nCompared to other types of automation, AI will have a greater impact on high-income workers\n\nSource: (un)Common Logic analysis of Felten et al. (2021), Frey & Osborne (2013), Bureau of Labor Statistics data | Image Credit: (un)Common Logic\n\nThe trend toward computerized automation has historically made lower-income jobs more vulnerable to displacement, but AI changes that dynamic. AI-related automation shows a loose positive correlation with income, suggesting that higher earners may now face greater risk.\n\nDue to the distribution of industries and jobs across the country, AI-driven job displacement is likely to impact some areas more than others. In five states -- South Dakota, Kansas, Delaware, Florida, and New York -- more than one in ten workers are vulnerable to AI-related automation, facing both high levels of AI exposure and high probabilities of automation. These states have high concentrations of workers in the knowledge sector. Conversely, states like Indiana, Arkansas, and Nevada, where the workforce is more concentrated in agriculture, manufacturing, or service professions, face a lower risk of AI-driven automation. However, general automation could still impact up to half of the workforce in these areas.\n\nAmong major metropolitan areas with populations of one million or more, locations in Florida and New York account for four of the top five regions at greatest risk of AI job displacement. These include Tampa, Miami, Jacksonville, and Buffalo, which have higher concentrations of workers in sectors susceptible to AI automation. In contrast, the two major metros facing the lowest risk of AI-related job loss are both in California: Riverside and San Jose.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by (un)Common Logic, a data-driven digital marketing agency, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources. For a detailed breakdown of AI-related job displacement risks for 389 metropolitan statistical areas and all 50 states, refer to Cities With the Most Workers at Risk of AI Job Displacement on (un)Common Logic.\n\nPhoto Credit: Siro46 / Shutterstock\n\nData sources include the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (2023), Frey and Osborne's Probability of Computerization by Occupation (2013), and Felten et al.'s AI Occupational Exposure (2021). To determine the locations with the most workers at risk of AI-related job displacement, researchers calculated the percentage of workers in occupations that have both high AI exposure and high probabilities of computerization. For the purpose of this analysis, high AI exposure was defined as being at least one standard deviation above the mean and high probability of computerization was defined as being 70% or more. Researchers also calculated the percentage of workers at risk of any computerized automation, which is simply the share of workers in occupations with high probabilities of computerization, regardless of their AI exposure. To improve comparisons across locations, metropolitan areas were grouped into cohorts based on population: small (less than 350,000), midsize (350,000-999,999), and large (1,000,000 or more).",

The latest one to weigh in on the matter is singer Neeti Mohan, who has strong opinions on the presence of AI in the Indian music scene. She asserts that while AI can enhance experiences, it can never replace the emotional depth brought by humans.\n\n\"I feel AI, robots, or any kind of artificial intelligence has to be used wisely. What an artist does is unique -- they bring their heart, soul, and energy into their work. It is something that can never be replaced,\" Mohan says.\n\nRecently, Oscar-winning music composer AR Rahman had used AI to recreate voices of late singers Bamba Bakya and Shahul Hameed for the song Thimiri Yezhuda in Lal Salam. It was revealed by the artiste himself that permission had been sought from family members and and remuneration sent for the same. The move, however, had attracted mixed reactions from within the industry and netizens.\n\nAlso Read: Singer Neeti Mohan: Every time I visit Delhi, I circle around India Gate\n\nSharing her personal views on it, Mohan highlights the need for caution and expresses concerns about AI potentially de-personalising art. She says, \"Yes, we do use technology and software (to enhance voices/music), but using AI to recreate a singer's voice who has passed away or using an existing singer's voice without their permission is illegal. I've heard that there are some legalities being worked out so that it is not misused in the future. AI is depersonlising art. After a point, people will themselves know that it is not a good choice.\"\n\nMohan, who recently released her rendition of Tu Hai Toh from Rajkummar Rao-starrer Mr & Mrs Mahi, concludes optimistically, acknowledging the humorous side of AI in creating multi-voice collages but cautions: \"I have seen some people making collages. It is nice and amusing. But beyond that I have not seen anyone misuse AI yet. Whatever be the case, people must be cautious because what is art, music, singing, dancing; It is human expression. If it becomes artificial, it may lose its impact.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeti_Mohan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeti Mohan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamba_Bakya", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bamba Bakya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Gate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India Gate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

More specifically, the bulletin addresses the use of AI in conjunction with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and other federal labor laws.\n\nAI can be useful in the workplace to automate employer functions, such as tracking employee work hours, screening applications for employment, setting work schedules, measuring employee performance, and performing other HR-related tasks. However, without proper human supervision, AI can potentially create risks for workers regarding violations of the labor laws that the DOL enforces. AI can result in system labor law violations that employers must be aware of and take proactive measures to avoid.\n\nAI and FLSA\n\nThe DOL's bulletin addressed AI technologies that may affect rights under FLSA, including those that track worker hours, monitor worker productivity, and calculate wages owed. For instance, some AI programs measure worker productivity in real time based on workers' keystrokes, mouse clicks, application use, web browser usage, and web camera presence.\n\nHowever, the DOL pointed out that overreliance on purely automated worker tracking mechanisms, combined with little to no human oversight, can result in potential problems with FLSA compliance. AI technologies may undercut employees' actual hours, especially when they work in multiple locations, utilize break times, and have periods where they are waiting for work or further engagement. Similarly, relying solely on algorithms to ensure that workers are accurately paid, including their regular rates and overtime premiums, may not always be correct. Again, human oversight is necessary to ensure that the AI program is accurately accounting for the full amount of a worker's wages.\n\nAI and FMLA\n\nLikewise, employers must comply with FMLA regardless of whether they use automated or manual systems to track employee leave time. While AI is useful for tracking and processing employee leave requests, employers must ensure that their systems accurately allow employees the full amount of leave to which they are entitled. AI systems are also more likely to be insufficient when determining eligibility under FMLA and federal leave laws, calculating the amount of leave entitlement, and determining qualifying reasons for leave. Therefore, employers must always personally oversee using AI systems to track and process leave requests to maintain compliance with federal law.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_and_Medical_Leave_Act_of_1993", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_and_Hour_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wage and Hour Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

(Getty Images)\n\nOregonians are apprehensive about artificial intelligence, a recent survey from the nonpartisan Oregon Values and Beliefs Center found.\n\nThe Portland-based nonprofit regularly surveys Oregonians about their opinions on matters of public interest. Its latest research on artificial intelligence comes as the state grapples with how to handle the emerging technology. Earlier this year, the Oregon Legislature passed a law to crack down on artificial intelligence used by political campaigns to mislead voters, and Gov. Tina Kotek formed a new advisory council.\n\nThe online survey of about 1,800 Oregonians found a general wariness of AI, though most have used some form of artificial intelligence in their day-to-day lives. Navigation tools like Google Maps, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, autofill and spam filters were most commonly used.\n\n\"While some Oregonians note potential benefits of AI, many of us feel like we're not quite up to speed on how to really tap into its potential,\" said Amaury Vogel, the center's associate executive director.\n\nRespondents were generally optimistic about AI being used for advancements in medicine, science and research, but they were most worried about its impact on jobs.\n\n\"Oregonians are hopeful about AI's potential to advance research and medicine, but they're worried about negative impacts on education, jobs, politics, and art,\" Vogel said. \"They're concerned enough about the impact on jobs, they want to make sure people who lose their jobs due to advances in AI receive unemployment benefits.\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of those surveyed said the government should regulate the corporations developing artificial intelligence, though about the same number of respondents said they didn't trust that the state government has the necessary expertise to regulate the complex industry.\n\nRespondents were evenly split on whether decisions about how to regulate AI should be left to the people and, by extension, their elected representatives, or whether it should be handled by independent experts. More respondents trusted the scientific community, ethics experts or leading universities to make decisions about AI than trusted the government or technology companies.\n\nWhen it came to government regulation, more than half of respondents favored passing laws that require AI research and development be done in the public interest, while about one-third supported a \"wait and see\" approach of monitoring AI without supporting or slowing its development. About a quarter of respondents wanted the state to recruit AI companies to Oregon, while a fifth wanted the state to ban the use of AI models by all state government officials.\n\nPollsters also asked Oregonians about their support for various responses to AI development, finding strong support for unemployment benefits for people whose jobs become obsolete because of AI and incentives for companies to find technology-driven solutions for more affordable necessities. A slight majority of respondents supported the concepts of a universal basic income, or guarantee that everyone would receive a wage regardless of employment, and for guaranteed jobs for all citizens.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Kotek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tina Kotek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexa Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal basic income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/oregon_capital_chronicle_articles_871/4201c4efa096d3ead90d9c6bfee9c5b4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

We all know that,\" said Birnbaum with United, whose updates now include real-time weather radar maps to help customers understand how inclement weather in one part of the country can affect flights elsewhere. \"There are storms, there are ... disruptions you can't avoid it.\"\n\nWhile speaking at an industry event last month, Birnbaum elaborated on the ways generative AI can simplify running an airline with a hypothetical scenario in New York's airspace.\n\n\"The air traffic controller will call and say 'Hey ... you thought you're landing 60 planes an hour. Guess what? You're only going to land 20. You tell us which 20 you want to land in the next hour or two hours or three hours.\"\n\nFinding a solution requires balancing many variables: customers on connecting flights, which crews are on board and where they are headed next. The list goes on -- too long for most humans, who wind up making \"suboptimal decisions,\" Birnbaum said.\n\nWhich is just where generative AI can help.\n\nRelated: Alaska Airlines is using generative AI for flight searches\n\nGenerative AI's impact on airlines\n\nAirline industry leaders and partners are looking at a number of key areas in which generative AI can propel the industry forward -- or smooth current processes.\n\nEric L\u00e9opold, founder of aviation consultancy Threedot, recently conducted a study on generative AI usage by 15 airlines with a group of graduate students at Cranfield University. While the study is not public, he shared some of the findings.\n\n\"The three main use cases identified in the study leverage GenAI's ability to understand, summarize and generate text (in natural language) and include: digital customer assistant (commercial), incident report and root cause analysis (operational), reduction of manual reconciliations (support),\" said L\u00e9opold.\n\n\"Almost all key processes will be impacted by AI, some sooner, others later,\" said Olaf Backofen, head of channel partnership management for Lufthansa Group, noting he sees innovation as a current focus with benefits in efficiency and how airlines are serving customers.\n\nBackofen also cited dynamic pricing, revenue optimization, crew scheduling, demand forecasting, route optimization and baggage handling as areas with room to benefit from the technology.\n\n\"I see that the biggest potential is on the customer front for the generative AI use cases,\" said Antti Kleemola, chief information officer and executive board member at Finnair.\n\nKleemola nodded to assisting and servicing customers in a better, more personal manner starting with booking and running through the passenger journey -- including disruption management, staff connection and more.\n\n\"The second big area is software development,\" Kleemola continued, pointing to use cases for supporting customers and internal users. \"Here the change will be in productivity and also in innovation capability as more and more people become citizen developers with the help of GenAI.\"\n\nAlready, Finnair is implementing multilingual customer support with the help of generative AI, giving travelers the ability to interact with agents whose own language is different from theirs.\n\nSabre's Wiseman said the company is looking at generative AI potential and current impact on the airline industry in three contexts including productivity, customer service and innovation.\n\nChris Branagan, chief technology officer at IBS Software, which provides SaaS solutions for airlines, had a similar outlook on generative AI.\n\n\"It's got great potential to have a really positive impact ... for the operation of an airline, and also the customer experience with an airline,\" said Branagan.\n\nBranagan pointed to tools for airline agents to simplify their jobs--including those capable of identifying the next best option to help with customer service--and believes generative AI can take customer service further still with chatbots.\n\n\"Chatbots should be able to deal with an awful lot of the questions coming to an airline,\" said Branagan. \"I can see that in the future if there's a problem at an airport ... chatbots should be able to combine sources of information and media to be able to get people a real-time perspective of what's going on. Which is often going to be quicker than the airport or the airline being able to update their own platforms.\"\n\nHe predicts information will come from a combination of sources including social media feeding into generative AI -- which could result in \"richer information closer to the event.\"\n\nBranagan also believes generative AI will make an even bigger difference thanks to recommendation engines for vacation inspiration -- where it is already making an impact.\n\n\"AI systems can generate customized offers and promotions based on real-time analysis of passenger data, such as suggesting upgrades, lounge access or travel insurance that align with the traveler's profile and preferences,\" said Lufthansa's Backofen.\n\nAnd while plenty is being explored, some say progress is likely to be slower than anticipated -- even if every player in the space is interested.\n\n\"I would say every airline is looking into how they can leverage AI,\" said Cole Wrightson, chief product officer at FLYR Labs, which provides AI-powered revenue management systems and optimization tools for airlines.\n\n\"But I think we're very early in the cycle of actual use cases where we're pushing the needle forward,\" he continued. \"There's a lot of this kind of early 'gold rush' trying to figure out where there actually is value and how things that have worked in other applications can be meaningfully deployed at airlines or in other travel areas.\"\n\nAnd it's not necessarily easy to gear existing legacy airline systems toward generative AI adaption, Wrightson said.\n\n\"The technology infrastructure that airlines have ... is very constraining in terms of their ability to use these techniques because ... they aren't able to access the data or sort of bring various data pieces together,\" he said.\n\nThe next 3 to 5 years\n\nGenerative AI has already prompted a good amount of excitement and innovation. Industry leaders have some predictions for how the technology will be used going forward.\n\n\"GenAI will [continue to] revolutionize [the] airline industry as [in] almost all parts of our life,\" said Backofen. \"It will help to provide new [customer] services and further increase efficiency.\"\n\nSabre's Wiseman looked back before looking ahead.\n\n\"If you consider that ChatGPT or Gemini were unheard of three years ago, then it's incredible to think about where we might be in the next three years,\" said Wiseman. \"You can expect to see the increasing adoption of AI-powered technology by airlines, with the focus on modular, next-gen solutions that are platform agnostic and can be adapted to suit an individual airline's business strategy and pace of change.\"\n\nL\u00e9opold had a more specific trajectory in mind. In the next three or so years, he anticipates generative AI will be implemented, tested, assessed and deployed so all employees and customers are using it. That will prompt robust changes to processes and procedures -- L\u00e9opold expects airlines to become more efficient, for the customer experience to be smoothed even when it comes to disruptions, which he believes are likely to ramp up with climate change.\n\nAnd even with that in mind -- it's hard to know, he said what things will look like in such a short period seeing how far generative AI has come in a year and a half or so.\n\n\"The progress is just going to be augmented in the next three years,\" said L\u00e9opold. \"We just don't know the next step of GenAI. Actually, it's not containerized, it's going to be a different kind of AI.\"\n\nAI, L\u00e9opold surmised, could theoretically make breakthrough discoveries no human being has been able to achieve, like a cure for cancer or how to decarbonize aviation or how to create fuel from the sun using nuclear power. \"We live in exciting times.\"\n\nBalancing human and AI capabilities\n\nThere's been widespread chatter about whether generative AI could replace humans in many industries across the globe as the hype continues around the new technology.\n\nIn the airline space, the technology could change the characteristics airlines seek in employees, without replacing the need for real workers.\n\n\"Airlines are already placing more emphasis on the technological transformation required to remain top of mind for passengers in the competitive aviation landscape, and that is creating a shift towards a workforce with a more balanced and forward-thinking skill set,\" said Sabre's Wiseman. \"While more repetitive tasks will be automated, human skills such as critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence are more important than ever.\"\n\nHe believes the industry will see a bump in the need for certain skills as more and more routine tasks can be handled by AI. For example, there may be more demand for AI data scientists and employees to fill human-centered customer service roles.\n\n\"The overall focus will likely shift toward a more tech-savvy workforce with a strong blend of human and AI capabilities and a willingness to constantly learn to keep pace with the evolving landscape.\"\n\nBackofen believes new job profiles will be needed. An airline, for example, might seek a generative AI expert with knowledge on AI marketing as opposed to a marketing or IT expert.\n\n\"Hence, a transformation is needed to adapt existing positions and skill resp. engage employees,\" said Backofen. \"[Generative AI] helps to support us humans, spend less time in searching [for] information and do repetitive tasks but more in listening to customer[s] and communicat[ing].\"\n\nSource: PhocusWire", "source": {"uri": "travelweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global distribution system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finnair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfield_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cranfield University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Root cause analysis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/All_TW_Art/Shutterstock_Art/2021/T1129AirfareShopping_SS_HR.jpg?n=1562&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Murphy is also executive sponsor of the lab.\n\nAccenture is no stranger to AI, having made a series of deep investments in this space in recent years, eyeing the potential it foresees.\n\nMurphy said some 90% of the companies in the finalist class for the lab this year were either direct AI plays or use AI as part of their solution, which plays well with the needs of incumbents in the financial sector. \"While there was an element of the financial institutions learning what's going on and just kind of exploring, better understanding the technologies, and how they can fit into the regulated environment, we saw one interesting event just as we finished this year's class,\" Murphy said. \"One of the companies actually got acquired by a financial institution.\"\n\nRelated:AI, Data, and Crypto in Play at Fintech Innovation Lab Demo Day\n\nAcquired by NuBank for undisclosed terms, Hyperplane, which did not demo, developed a platform that uses specialized LLMs to let financial institutions offer personalized consumer experiences. \"There was definitely an interest to bring that capability and the talent in-house,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe financial sector can tend to be reticent about adopting new technologies or methodologies, especially considering the regulatory scrutiny many financial institutions may face. Though AI can open up new frontiers that do not have deeply established guardrails in place, it seems that financial institutions cannot ignore the possibilities the technology might offer, especially as AI skyrockets in use and spread compared with other emerging technologies.\n\n\"It's a boom versus a gradual ramp,\" Gotsch said. \"I guess the two technologies, for the just about 14 years that we've been running, I would contrast it to is digital currency and the cloud and they both went through interesting journeys.\"\n\nDigital currency, she said, started out with crypto, which went through phases where financial institutions felt they could not touch it, but then needed to learn about it. Then financial institutions wanted to know what the compelling use case would be for them. Regarding the cloud, Gotsch said financial institutions also took a gradual approach, first with a few taking early steps into using it followed by a mix of adoption across a 10-year effort.\n\nRelated:AI, Bitcoin, and Distilled Spirits at New York Fintech Week\n\n\"In the early days of the lab,\" she said, \"the common question to these early-stage companies was ... 'Where are you building your solution?' And the answer was, 'On the Amazon cloud, of course.'\" That might not sit well, however, with institutions that require solutions to be on-prem. Gotsch said much of the financial sector has looked into a dual strategy that includes private cloud within a third-party provider while some continue to maintain data rooms.\n\nThe lightspeed spread of AI, however, seems to have pushed the financial world to take notice and interest in ways they might leverage such tools. \"It's the generative AI and the putting it in the hands of kind of the average person that has dramatically accelerated -- that's why I call it sort of a boom factor,\" Gotsch said. \"It was not a gradual increase in interest. It was, 'Yeah, we're doing things with AI,' to 'We're doing things with AI! We want to learn things about AI.'\"\n\nFor Accenture's perspective, Murphy concurred with the depiction of the AI boom. \"We see it as a pervasive technology that's going to be providing value and leverage throughout the value chain of all of our industries,\" he said. \"One of the things that we started to see some good examples of in this year's class and I think, and I hope we will see in next year's and beyond is now, in addition to the companies being aimed at helping the financial institutions just execute well on base camp use cases ...We see there's high opportunity and great impact and value to be had.\" This could include customer service and sales, marketing and content creation, or even such functions as copilots for regulatory compliance or underwriters, he said.", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumis_(region)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qumis (region)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blta1ac3b4e2a7c1d70/668d9fe586ce3f0a9743146b/MariaGotsch_PartnershipFundNYC_2023-JPRUTH.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

While Sir Keir Starmer did not quite embrace tech as a campaigning message in the same way, there is no doubt that technology will transform the country whatever his government does.\n\nWhat can we expect? What should the government do? And how can the tech sector take advantage of the opportunities a new government presents? We heard from tech leaders to get their views.\n\nBrace for regulation\n\nThe new government clearly disagrees with Rishi Sunak's comment that now is not the time for AI regulation, and is planning a Regulatory Innovation Office. \"Labour's promise to introduce 'binding regulation' for AI safety will create ripple effects across the UK private and public sectors,\" said Eduardo Crespo, EMEA VP of AI-powered operations platform PagerDuty. \"\n\nCrespo highlighted that more than half of IT leaders had reported an increase in incidents caused by 'bad AI'. \"Organisations leaning on these emerging technologies will have to scrutinise their AI strategy here and now,\" he added.\n\nThe introduction of new regulation will mean that many in the workforce will require additional training to meet the requirements imposed on them.\n\nNikolaz Foucaud, Managing Director EMEA at training platform Coursera, says that the changes require \"a concerted effort across industry and government to nurture digital skills, to ensure that the British workforce is conversant with the technology that it is regulating and leveraging.\"\n\nRegulation of AI does not stop it from providing benefits, however. Foucaud continued, \"there is much optimism that generative AI will catalyse a productivity increase, with early research suggesting that AI skills can have outsized benefits for less productive workers.\" Providing the high-quality training is a core component to realising those benefits, he said the government's \"AI strategy must therefore emphasise skills as much as safety.\"\n\nUnlocking the future: an innovation boom\n\nPhil Burr, the head of product at Lumai, also highlighted the UK's potential as a leader in AI. \"We need to nurture the UK's exceptional AI talent,\" he said. \"This involves leveraging our many world-leading education institutions to encourage education on AI and help to further develop the next generation of talent.\"\n\nBurr feels there are opportunities for AI across a range of business sectors, but to support this, the \"new government needs to provide an environment which continues to foster startups and scaleups across both hardware and software,\" he said. But he was optimistic about the potential, \"the UK has the capability of creating world-leading hardware companies that enable AI in the most energy-efficient way.\"\n\nNew government, new opportunities\n\nThe government has long played a key role in developing businesses through policy and, often, with more direct financial support. Simon Wax, a partner in the Tech and Media team at accountants Buzzacott, pointed out that the new government made several promises, including not just new trade deals, but also of investment in clean and environmental tech and R&D.\n\nThose promises were met by a positive reaction from the markets, he said. \"The market reaction to the new Labour government has been very positive. This is in part due to Labour's promise of fiscal prudence that they preached throughout their election campaign.\"\n\nThat positivity was echoed by Dale Peters, Senior Research Director at TechMarketView. \"Technology will play a key role in the new government's reforms, which will create opportunities for software and IT services suppliers,\" he said. However, he added a caveat: \"As we discussed in our latest UK SITS Market Trends & Forecasts 2024 report, any eagerness to transform is likely to be held back by the 3Cs of Caution, Concern, and Complexity.\"\n\nBuzzacott's Wax also sounded a note of caution. A new government might present new opportunities, but that does not mean they need to be taken. \"Every business is different,\" he said. \"My advice to tech founders seeking investment is first to consider why they need the investment in the first place. Is it to grow faster, fund their cash burn, or simply because funds are available?\"\n\nStable but transformative\n\nIn practice, it might not be the new government's tech policy that really makes the difference. Although ambitious government plans for AI regulation, skills, and innovation may be welcome, many will value the stability offered by a new government.\n\nHowever, although the new government may mean an end to the political dramas of the past few years, it has inherited other difficulties. \"Labour has highlighted the importance of private-sector investment, strong industry partnerships, and creating the right conditions for innovation as being key to building a stronger economy,\" said TechMarketView's Peters, before adding that not everything was positive. \"It is clear the new UK government is facing an immensely challenging economic backdrop, which will necessitate tough budgetary decisions later this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "techfundingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Funding News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harold Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PagerDuty", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PagerDuty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coursera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Prime_Minister_Sir_Keir_Starmer_Official_Portrait.dd7a5eec90d141ec8721ff369c7fb132.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Yet, a recent Google AI research reported that artificial intelligence may ruin how we see reality.\n\nThe arXiv paper's title is \"Generative AI Misuse; A Taxonomy of Tactics and Insights from Real-World Data.\"\n\nIt says artificial intelligence is enabling people to spread misinformation, whether or not intended.\n\nREAD: How to boost learning with ChatGPT\n\nModern AI programs are far from perfect, but they're becoming highly effective in creating convincing text, photos, videos, and other media.\n\nAs a result, people find it harder to identify what's real and fabricated.\n\nWhat were the Google AI research's findings?\n\nGoogle researchers learned more about the impacts of artificial intelligence by studying existing reports on Generative AI (GenAI) misuse.\n\nThen, they plotted patterns common among these datasets.\n\n\"The widespread availability, accessibility, and hyperrealism of GenAI outputs across modalities have also enabled new, lower-level forms of misuse that blur the lines between authentic presentation and deception.\"\n\nIn layman's terms, AI tools have become so prevalent that more people can misuse the technology. After all, you can use most of these powerful tools without paying a centavo.\n\nAI programs have become so advanced that they can make photorealistic images and videos.\n\nHowever, most people do not properly indicate that their AI-generated images and other media came from artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a result, they make it difficult to distinguish between real and fake information and content. Worse, these have more profound effects on our society.\n\nFor instance, AI-generated media on political candidates makes it difficult for the public to identify the truth regarding their potential leaders.\n\nThe Google AI research says more resort to the \"liar's dividend.\" It is the phenomenon where high-profile individuals can dismiss any unfavorable information as AI-fabricated.\n\nMore importantly, artificial intelligence could make it harder for everyone to gain reliable information on anything. As a result, it may impede society from addressing its problems.\n\nIf we cannot agree on facts regarding any issue, how can we start planning solutions?\n\nThat is why the Google AI research paper concludes by recommending a \"multi-faceted approach to mitigating GenAI misuse.\"\n\nWe need \"policymakers, researchers, industry leaders, and civil society\" to collaborate regarding this issue.\n\nFortunately, the Philippines has a pending AI Bill that may help the country do so.

The laws, paraphrased, are as follows. First Law: A robot may not harm a human or, through inaction, allow a human to be harmed. Second Law: A robot must obey the orders of a human except where the orders violate the First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as that protection doesn't violate the First or Second Laws.\n\nMany people have problems with Asimov's 'Laws' because they were designed as a fictional device to sell more of his stories. They don't always translate to real-world scenarios. However, at last week's four-day 2024 World AI Conference (WAIC) held in Shanghai, China released the official Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance, the first governance guidelines for artificial intelligence, and called on other countries to work together to enact it.\n\n\"We look forward to the positive responses of governments, the scientific and technological community, the industry and all parties involved, so that we can work together to promote AI to benefit mankind,\" said Chen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committee Secretary of Shanghai, announcing the Declaration at the opening ceremony of WAIC.\n\nThe Declaration fits squarely with the theme of this year's conference - \"Governing AI for good and for all\" - and it follows the United Nations General Assembly's adoption, a few days prior, of a China-led resolution meant to help poorer nations benefit from AI's capabilities. The resolution was co-sponsored by over 140 countries, including the US.\n\n\"It's fair to say that this document showcases the unity and cooperation of various countries and their determination and confidence in promoting some orderly and inclusive development of AI,\" said Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, during a special briefing as part of the High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance that was held alongside the conference. \"It's a milestone in global AI governance, especially in promoting capacity building. It has far-reaching influence on shaping the future of the world.\"\n\nAn English version of the Declaration is on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China's website, but it's too lengthy to reproduce here in full. So, here are the highlights:\n\nThe final two paragraphs of the Declaration address the importance of public input in AI decision-making, improving digital literacy, and using AI to increase social well-being and contribute to the resolution of \"global issues.\"\n\nThe Declaration's focus on humanity, including the humans behind the continued development of AI and those who use it, gives it a distinctly Asimovian flavor. But will these guidelines lead to international cooperation and safeguard the public?\n\nIn the last few years, China has demonstrated that it's ahead of the game in terms of AI governance, rolling out some of the world's first binding regulations that have caused US lawmakers to sit up and take notice. So, arguably, China knows what it's doing.

It assumes a lot of facts not in evidence and utterly ignores some important dimensions of the work of teaching and learning in education spaces. According to the IHE reporting, Anna Ivey, a former dean of admissions for the University of Chicago Law School, \"laughed out loud in a San Francisco Starbucks upon reading parts of the report.\"\n\nI interpret Ivey's laugh as one of incredulity that this is being taken seriously because it is so transparently B.S., an emotion I share, but an emotion that is quickly followed by a different emotion: deep worry that important people are taking these ill-considered claims quite seriously.\n\nHere's the crux of the issue: Which group are institutions going to listen to about how to go about their work, venture capitalists or people who know something about teaching and learning?\n\nI fear that answer to that question, but I'm going to set it aside for now to instead draw a distinction between the different mindsets that people like Mary Meeker and, for lack of a better alternative ... me, bring to the question of using AI in education.\n\nIn essence, I think process matters, that the journey one takes to the destination of a credential is meaningful independent of the credential itself. Learning is found in the process, and too much of what we already ask students to do does not take the journey into account.\n\nMeeker and the AI-enthusiast venture capitalists believe that all that matters is the product. Do stuff, get a credential, rinse and repeat.\n\nWhen it comes to actually learning how to do important and meaningful things, Meeker is wrong, but she may be right that we are heading toward a future where it's no longer important to actually know how to do stuff like think and write because we're going to engage in one big, collective shrug and decide that whatever generative AI tools can conjure is an acceptable substitute.\n\nThis difference in mindset jumped off the page in one statement, highlighted by Coffey in the IHE article:\n\nWhat Meeker describes as \"the basics,\" meaning things that are of low priority and therefore amenable to outsourcing to generative AI, are not actually the basics. We should not see things like planning what we teach, reviewing the work students do in response to those plans and interacting with our students as \"the basics.\"\n\nInstead, we should think of them as the fundamentals.\n\nAs I've written previously, as a teacher of writing, I cannot outsource giving writing feedback to something that cannot read. Reading student writing is a fundamental part of teaching because I absolutely must know what students are doing to be able to help them develop. In fact, reading their work is not sufficient by itself. I must also have a conversation with them about my impressions of what they've written. This is the work.\n\nLesson plans, or something like the syllabus, cannot be outsourced because this is the blueprint that will inform my work. The opportunity to think through the problem of teaching a particular course is a necessity.\n\nThe cheerleaders for the use of this technology in educational spaces appear to know little to nothing about education. The only way this gets traction is if we ignore this distinction.\n\nLots of people appear willing to ignore those distinctions because it will increase \"productivity.\" What is the endgame to all those productivity increases other than to eliminate the mess humans make from the educational space?\n\nAI assigns the work, students use AI to do the work, AI grades the work. Humans are in the loop to do what, exactly?\n\nI ask again, what is the point?\n\nI have no power and little influence when it comes to shaping the decisions that will be made by those who do have power and influence -- the blog is not mightier than the dollar -- but I cannot more strongly urge the people who do have these responsibilities to not give in to generative AI FOMO. The wealthiest tech companies in the world are throwing every last dollar (along with every last drop of water and kilowatt of energy) at AI development.\n\nThe result is likely to be a future in which access to the core AI models will be something like a commodity, closer to a cable subscription than something that requires exclusive or proprietary applications.\n\nDo you know who agrees with me? Goldman Sachs, which believes the spending on generative AI is far out of proportion to its likely benefits.\n\nAll of the supposed productivity benefits of generative AI tools in education require abandoning work that should be done by humans. The fact that we can't seem to find the resources to pay humans to do the work is not a recommendation for using generative AI.\n\nEmbracing Mary Meeker's vision means giving up on education, not advancing it.", "source": {"uri": "insidehighered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_warner@insidehighered.com", "name": "John Warner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullshit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Meeker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mary Meeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeker_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meeker County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Meeker County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Higher_Ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside Higher Ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/modules/custom/ihe_custom/img/ihe-logo-no-wordmark.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

BuehlerMcAfee Professor of EngineeringMIT Professional Education\n\nIn this interview, Markus Beuhler discusses MIT's Machine Learning for Materials Informatics course, its curriculum, and its impact on the broader materials science community, emphasizing the exciting potential for AI-driven discoveries in sustainable materials and energy solutions.\n\nHow has AI fundamentally altered the approach to materials design?\n\nAI, primarily through generative AI models, has dramatically changed our approach by accelerating the design process significantly. These models can predict material properties from extensive datasets, enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation that used to take years. We can now iterate designs quickly, focusing on the most promising materials early in the development phase, enhancing both efficiency and creativity in materials science. This is a huge leap forward because it reduces the time and cost associated with traditional materials development, allowing for more experimentation and innovation.\n\nWhat are some of today's most impressive state-of-the-art tools and applications in AI-driven materials science?\n\nOne notable application is using deep learning models to infer the internal properties of materials from surface data. This technology is groundbreaking, particularly for industries like aerospace and biomedical, where non-destructive testing is crucial. These models can predict internal flaws or stresses by analyzing external properties without physically altering the material. This capability is essential for maintaining the integrity of critical structures and devices, making materials safer and more reliable while saving time and resources. Other recent advances are in multimodal AI, where such models can design materials and understand and generate multiple input and output types, such as text, images, chemical formulas, microstructural designs, and much more.\n\nImage Credit: MIT Professional Education\n\nIntegrating AI into materials science must present some challenges. Can you discuss these?\n\nThe integration of AI brings challenges, particularly regarding the interpretability of AI models. Engineers and scientists must understand how predictions are made, which is not always clear with complex AI models. This opacity can make it difficult to trust and rely on AI outputs, especially in fields where material failure could have dire consequences. Addressing this challenge involves creating more transparent AI systems that offer insights into their decision-making processes, building trust and facilitating their adoption in sensitive and critical applications. One such way by which we are addressing this is by using several interacting AIs that challenge each other's predictions, and that introduce physics and math into the solution process, to teach AIs how to 'think'and reason with proper scientific grounding.\n\nWith AI opening new frontiers, what unique opportunities are now available in materials science?\n\nAI enables the design of materials with customized properties tailored to specific applications, a significant advancement. For instance, we can now design lighter, more durable, or thermally resistant materials based on the requirements of specific applications like renewable energy technologies or electronic devices. Moreover, AI's capability to explore and suggest novel material combinations across vast ranges of scales offers the potential to discover materials with properties that we have not even considered before, paving the way for innovations that could transform entire industries.\n\nLooking to the future, what role do you see AI playing in materials science?\n\nAI is set to play a transformative role in discovering new materials and optimizing manufacturing processes, especially when we deploy multiple AIs that interact, referred to as multi-agent AI. By leveraging multi-agent AI, such a system no longer relies solely on training data but can generate its own data by writing code, running new simulations, and developing new feedback about how these materials work. In the development phase, we can achieve higher precision and efficiency, reducing waste and enhancing productivity. Additionally, as we refine AI technologies, they will enable the molecular-level design of materials, offering precise control over their properties. This could lead to breakthroughs in numerous areas, such as energy storage, where enhanced materials could lead to more efficient batteries and other storage solutions.\n\nCould y\n\nImage Credit: MIT Professional Education\n\nou tell us more about MIT's Machine Learning for Materials Informatics course? What topics are covered?\n\nThe course focuses on teaching machine learning fundamentals and applications in materials science. It covers various topics, from the basics of machine learning techniques to advanced applications in materials informatics, such as multimodal LLMs. We explore how these technologies can predict material properties, design new materials, and even reverse engineer existing ones. The course includes hands-on labs where participants apply these techniques to real-world problems, using state-of-the-art software and tools, and how engineers can fine-tune their own LLMs and other generative tools. It is designed to empower professionals with the skills needed to lead the innovation of materials design using AI.\n\nWhat specific skills or knowledge will participants gain from this course at MIT?\n\nParticipants will learn to apply machine learning models to complex materials science challenges across all scales. They will gain expertise in managing large datasets, using AI to predict material behaviors, and implementing inverse design techniques. The course also emphasizes the synergy between traditional materials science and modern computational methods, encouraging a holistic approach that integrates both fields. This will enable participants to push the boundaries of materials science, driving innovation in their respective areas. I pay particular attention to giving participants a deep understanding of how modern generative AI models work so that they can be fully informed about their potentials, risks and how to best use them for materials science applications.\n\nHow do you believe educational programs like this one impact the broader materials science community?\n\nEducational programs like this are crucial for advancing the field. They help bridge the gap between traditional materials science methods and modern computational approaches, equipping professionals with the necessary tools to innovate effectively. By fostering a better understanding of how AI can be integrated into materials science, these programs enable the community to tackle new challenges more creatively and efficiently. They also help in cultivating a generation of materials scientists who are well-versed in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI applications in materials design.\n\nLastly, what excites you most about the convergence of AI and materials science?\n\nThe most exciting aspect is the potential for discovery, including new knowledge and solutions. AI opens up possibilities that go beyond human intuition and conventional experimentation. It allows us to explore vast combinations of materials and properties at an unprecedented scale. I am particularly excited about the potential for AI to uncover new materials that could solve critical global challenges, like developing sustainable materials, dealing with the challenges of a changing climate, or new energy sources. The ability of AI to accelerate these discoveries enhances our scientific understanding but also has the potential to make a significant impact on our society and environment, and the innovation ecosystem.\n\nAbout Markus Beuhler\n\nMarkus J.

text-to-speech service, please first agree to the privacy policy below.\n\nTransforming Taiwan into an \"artificial intelligence (AI) island,\" proposed by President Lai Ching-te (\u8cf4\u6e05\u5fb7) in his inaugural speech in May, will need to meet underlying intangible conditions for it to become reality, Taiwan's new tech chief has cautioned.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNA, Wu Cheng-wen (\u5433\u8aa0\u6587), the new head of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), affirmed Lai's vision of leveraging chipmaking to consolidate Taiwan's role in the AI era.\n\nAt Computex in early June, the president listed three foundational tasks for this transition: setting up data centers with supercomputers to build up computational power; ensuring electricity, especially green power; and cultivating talent for these industries.\n\nWu told CNA that strengthening these physical capabilities and human resources would indeed buttress the building of an AI island, but other intangible conditions were also needed.\n\nPrimary among them are building AI research capacity and developing an AI industry, Wu said, but most important will be fostering a culture of people willing to use AI as a tool so that the research can be relevant and the industry can flourish.\n\nWu acknowledged Taiwan's prowess in hardware manufacturing to support an AI infrastructure, but developing broader AI technologies and systems also would necessitate R&D capabilities, he said.\n\n\"Developing systems means more than semiconductors and equipment manufacturing,\" he said, especially given that Taiwan's semiconductor vendors cater their manufacturing to the needs of foreign clients.\n\n\"Be it Nvidia, AMD, Intel or Qualcomm, what they all ask is for Taiwanese companies to manufacture chips based on their designs, or sometimes we do the designs as well but the specifications are decided by them,\" Wu said.\n\n\"That OEM (original equipment manufacturer) model has a high entry threshold, and Taiwan is the only one that has the required manufacturing capability,\" Wu said, but an advanced AI island \"would need to have more than that.\"\n\nThe government now is making an effort to leverage that advantage to stimulate R&D in software and system integration, Wu added.\n\nThis is conditioned upon the presence of an industry to incentivize the R&D of AI systems and applications, and the success of an industry in turn is \"driven by people's basic needs,\" Wu believed.\n\nThat means the key for an AI island boils down to Taiwanese people having the mindset of using AI tools and systems, he said.\n\nAsked whether using ChatGPT qualifies as a building block in this culture, Wu had his reservations.\n\nThough it is \"nearly human\" in terms of natural language processing, \"as a tool it actually has traps and risks of providing misleading or mistaken answers and can be misused when you have little understanding of its limitations,\" according to Wu.\n\nOnly when users have a good understanding of both the advantages and limitations of AI tools, and can use them with ease, can it be said that a culture has formed, he noted.\n\n\"We are working toward the goal of fostering a culture of using AI tools beyond the high-tech sector, which only represents a minority of a society,\" Wu said.\n\n\"When we can define and develop industry from the needs,\" resources can be allocated to different sectors rather than concentrated in certain fields, he added.\n\nWu did not specify on what the government could do to help build the culture, but he hinted at a government-initiated project, to be announced later this year, to foster collaboration between Taiwan's existing strengths and sectors to develop AI systems based on needs.\n\nHe cited medical care as one promising field for developing Taiwan's local AI system.\n\nOne application, Wu suggested, could be a \"hospital at home\" assisted by AI systems, which could tackle the problems of an aging society, shortage of health care workers, and lack of resources in rural and remote communities.\n\nThe market would be big if every household needed AI devices for this kind of health care service, he said, adding that setting up a medical cloud could also rely on Taiwan's own technologies and accommodate its own health care system and needs.\n\nThis kind of coordination will be supported by the new policy, with the goal of implementing it in every sector, from national defense to non-tech industries, Wu said.\n\n\"Once AI becomes a basic need, or culture, of the general

Spain, MIT Sloan Management Review, AGC Power Holdings, Prisma Media and Harvard Business Review.\n\nThe MX3 report covers all the major topics addressed in the council meeting, including artificial intelligence, tech innovation, revenue strategies, engaging future generations, DEI, sustainability, advertising and licensing, as well as the enduring appeal of print magazines and the rise of creator-led media.\n\nThe report noted that Congress emphasized FIPP's mission to help media companies thrive amid the most rapid change the industry has ever seen, as well as to provide a hub for industry insights and act as a catalyst for growth and innovation.\n\nAs part of this, there was a focus on providing space for networking and an environment that fosters rich conversations between delegates.\n\nThe report highlights some of the key takeaways from the Congress and delves into the event's biggest talking point: AI, particularly the compelling keynote speech by Dr. Seth Doblin, CEO of Qantm AI, former Chief Global AI Officer at IBM, and author.\n\nAs soon as the delegates were seated, Dr. Doblin announced that AI is a fraud and that while generative AI has the potential to transform every industry, most organizations aren't getting value from it.\n\nDr Doblin urged media companies to have financial KPIs and accountability, saying AI would only inspire staff if it delivered clear business value.\n\nDoblin added that because AI is human-made, it will have flaws. With current AI technology, there is no way to avoid hallucinations. He allayed some fears, adding: \"If AI is going to make mistakes, they're going to be more accurate mistakes, and it's easier to deal with inaccuracies if you're accurate.\"\n\nWith one of the biggest debates in Congress being whether to collaborate with AI companies or sue those that train their algorithms on copyrighted content, Juan Seor of Innovation Media Consulting, presenting the Innovation in Media World report, informed delegates that Open AI's negotiating documents have been leaked and show the company offers both fixed and variable fees, but added that publishers only account for a third of AI input, with 30% being Wikipedia and corporate sites, 30% being academia, and 30% being journalism.\n\nDotdash Merediths CIO Dr. Jon Roberts said partnerships are the way forward, revealing that the company's deal with OpenAI is based on the theory that \"AI platforms should pay publishers for content, and that content must be properly attributed.\"\n\nSteffen Damborg, CEO and author of Mastering Digital Transformation, takes a different view: \"There's an asymmetric power dynamic between the big tech companies and the publishers. They're our worst competitors, and we're fighting for the same readership.\"\n\nThey are also investing billions in talent and software. Only journalism can save journalism. Stay true to your brand, invest in talent, and don't rely too much on GenAI to save your business.\n\nThe MX3 report also reveals the reasons for the resurgence of print media, why a key focus of Congress was the different monetisation strategies available to publishers, why inclusivity has become a central pillar of media business operations, and the real passion and commitment of publishers to engage with their readers more meaningfully.\n\nThe full report can be downloaded for free here.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotdash_Meredith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dotdash Meredith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Springer_SE", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axel Springer SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearst Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Sloan_Management_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MIT Sloan Management Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Business Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business-to-business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascais", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cascais"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cascais"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keynote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.fipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Article-header-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Labour's proposal to establish a Regulatory Innovation Office could consolidate existing laws and enhance enforcement. And plans to make voluntary safety rules legally binding and set up a National Data Library to support AI applications could address current challenges with training data, Armstrong said.\n\n\"The main thing to do will obviously be to keep alert to watch out for those changes,\" he said. He also suggested planning for EU AI regulations and including U.K. operations in compliance efforts, as many U.K. companies also operate in Europe.\n\nIn this video interview with Information Security Media Group, Armstrong discussed:\n\nArmstrong is a lawyer specializing in compliance and technology.

So, you need to be aware of it, trace it, and to think about how we apply it, but how we get to a place where, genuinely, it's part of the process that includes people I think is the right answer,\" he noted.\n\nLiz Syms, CEO of Connect for Intermediaries, said that she thought \"AI and the onset of that could come a little bit faster than we are perhaps prepared for\".\n\nShe noted that the sector potentially had to be wary of possible new entrants \"without the current baggage of the old entrants perhaps coming in and playing in our arena\".\n\nHowever, for those willing to \"embrace it and adopt it\", it \"will enhance the relationship that they have with their customers, improve service, improve speed\".\n\nAs an example, she said that Connect for Intermediaries was going live with an add-on for its client relationship management (CRM) system that would take the documentation that a customer gives it, like bank statements, and ensure it matches payslips, categorise it and help with affordability assessments.\n\n\"The real benefit of the AI is to remove some of that manual stuff that we're doing, and then it really relieves the administrators to work on those things that are real value-adds for the customer, in terms of building [a] relationship, in terms of giving advice and guidance, in terms of talking about things that we don't have the time or resources to do at this minute in time.\n\n\"So, I'm quite excited to see, you know, where it develops, and certainly within our business, we're looking to try as many things as possible,\" Syms said.\n\nJames Chutter, corporate account manager at Leeds Building Society, said that AI was \"going to bring some definite improvements\".\n\n\"We're not anywhere near Alexa being able to sort you out with a mortgage, that straight-through advice process has far too many working pieces to it. But AI will be able to do a lot more of the heavy lifting, and it's going to be able to analyse a lot more data a lot quicker, and give us much more insight, which will have a massive impact towards the customer.\"\n\nChutter said that AI will allow lenders to \"offer more bespoke, specialised underwriting\" along with \"quicker service\", which will then have ramifications on risk assessment and products to create \"more bespoke and interesting products\".\n\n\"I think the other thing to consider with AI is the risks that it comes with; it's fantastic that it doesn't come with any prejudice, but if you don't give it the right parameters, it also doesn't have any values, so AI can be used for fraud.\n\n\"It's already been used for fraud in terms of creating fake documents, and if we add this into our business and you get those parameters wrong, then it's going to create a massive issue, because if you're getting it to do one job, and that job then gets done wrong 1,000 times, then it's going to create a significant risk,\" he added.\n\nChutter continued: \"From an administrator's point of view, keep yourself updated with this, because I think this will help elevate administrators from being that processor to a more strategic position in the fact that if they get the understanding of how to use AI, then they suddenly become into a more strategic position of being able to see the analysis that comes out and how it's then used.\"", "source": {"uri": "mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mortgage Solutions"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_sagar@mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "name": "Anna Sagar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_Building_Society", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds Building Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bespoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexa Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2019/07/technologystocks-764x399-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

He had a helper: As Thompson paced around the class, peppering them with questions, he frequently turned to a voice-activated AI to summon apps and educational videos onto large-screen smartboards.\n\nWhen a student asked, \"Are there any animals that don't need water?\" Thompson put the question to the AI. Within seconds, an illustrated blurb about kangaroo rats appeared before the class.\n\nThompson's voice-activated assistant is the brainchild of computer scientist Satya Nitta, who founded a company called Merlyn Mind after many years at IBM where he had tried, and failed, to create an AI tool that could teach students directly. The foundation of that earlier, ill-fated project was IBM Watson, the AI that famously crushed several \"Jeopardy!\" champions. Despite Watson's gameshow success, however, it wasn't much good at teaching students. After plowing five years and $100 million into the effort, the IBM team admitted defeat in 2017.\n\n\"We realized the technology wasn't there,\" said Nitta, \"and it's still not there.\"\n\nSince the November 2022 launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, an expanding cast of AI tutors and helpers have entered the learning landscape. Most of these tools are chatbots that tap large language models -- or LLMs -- trained on troves of data to understand student inquiries and respond conversationally with a range of flexible and targeted learning assistance. These bots can generate quizzes, summarize key points in a complex reading, offer step-by-step graphing of algebraic equations, or provide feedback on the first draft of an essay, among other tasks. Some tools are subject-specific, such as Writable and Photomath, while others offer more all-purpose tutoring, such as Socratic (created by Google) and Khanmigo, a collaboration of OpenAI and Khan Academy, a nonprofit provider of online lessons covering an array of academic subjects.\n\nAs AI tools proliferate and their capabilities keep improving, relatively few observers believe education can remain AI free. At the same time, even the staunchest techno optimists hesitate to say that teaching is best left to the bots. The debate is about the best mix -- what are AI's most effective roles in helping students learn, and what aspects of teaching should remain indelibly human no matter how powerful AI becomes?\n\nSkepticism about AI's place in the classroom often centers on students using the technology to cut corners or on AI's tendency to hallucinate, i.e. make stuff up, in an eagerness to answer every query. The latter concern can be mitigated (albeit not eliminated) by programming bots to base responses on vetted curricular materials, among other steps. Less attention, however, is paid to an even thornier challenge for AI at the heart of effective teaching: engaging and motivating students.\n\nNitta said there's something \"deeply profound\" about human communication that allows flesh-and-blood teachers to quickly spot and address things like confusion and flagging interest in real time.\n\nHe joins other experts in technology and education who believe AI's best use is to augment and extend the reach of human teachers, a vision that takes different forms. For example, the goal of Merlyn Mind's voice assistant is to make it easier for teachers to engage with students while also navigating apps and other digital teaching materials. Instead of being stationed by the computer, they can move around the class and interact with students, even the ones hoping to disappear in the back.\n\nOthers in education are trying to achieve this vision by using AI to help train human tutors to have more productive student interactions, or by multiplying the number of students a human instructor can engage with by delegating specific tasks to AI that play to the technology's strengths. Ultimately, these experts envision a partnership in which AI is not called on to be a teacher but to supercharge the power of humans already doing the job.\n\nRelated: Become a lifelong learner.

The South Atlanta private school, where tuition is heavily subsidized for a majority low-income student body, is in a brick warehouse renovated to look like a low-slung Hogwarts, replete with an elaborate clocktower and a winged dragon perched above the main entrance.\n\nAs Thompson moved among his students, he wielded a slim remote control with a button-activated microphone he uses to command the AI software. At first, Thompson told the AI to start a three-minute timer that popped up on the smartboard, then he began asking rapid-fire review questions from a previous lesson, such as what causes wind. When students couldn't remember the details, Thompson asked the AI to display an illustration of airflow caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface.\n\nAt one point, he clambered up on a student worktable while discussing the stratosphere, claiming (inaccurately) that it was the atmospheric layer where most weather happens, just to see if any students caught his mistake (several students reminded him that weather happens in the troposphere). Then he conjured a new timer and launched into a lesson on water by asking the AI assistant to find a short educational movie about fresh and saltwater ecosystems. As Thompson moved through the class, he occasionally paused the video and quizzed students about the new content.\n\nStudy after study has shown the importance of student engagement for academic success. A strong connection between teachers and students is especially important when learners feel challenged or discouraged, according to Nitta. While AI has many strengths, he said, \"it's not very good at motivating you to keep doing something you're not very interested in doing.\"\n\n\"The elephant in the room with all these chatbots is how long will anyone engage with them?\" he said.\n\nThe answer for Watson was not long at all, Nitta recalled. In trial runs, some students just ignored Watson's attempts to probe their understanding of a topic, and the engagement level of those who initially did respond to the bot dropped off precipitously. Despite all Watson's knowledge and facility with natural language, students just weren't interested in chatting with it.\n\nRelated: PROOF POINTS: AI essay grading is 'already as good as an overburdened' teacher, but researchers say it needs more work\n\nAt a spring 2023 TED talk shortly after launching Khanmigo, Sal Khan, founder and CEO of Khan Academy, pointed out that tutoring has provided some of the biggest jolts to student performance among studied education interventions. But, there aren't enough human tutors available nor enough money to pay for them, especially in the wake of pandemic-induced learning loss.\n\nKhan envisioned a world where AI tutors filled that gap. \"We're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen,\" he declared. \"And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor.\"\n\nOne of Khanmigo's architects, Khan Academy's chief learning officer, Kristen DiCerbo, was the vice president of learning research and design for education publisher Pearson in 2016 when it partnered with IBM on the Watson tutor project.\n\n\"It was a different technology,\" said DiCerbo, recalling the laborious task of scripting Watson's responses to students.\n\nSince Watson's heyday, AI has become a lot more engaging. One of the breakthroughs of generative AI powered by LLMs is its ability to give unscripted, human-like responses to user prompts.\n\nTo spur engagement, Khanmigo doesn't answer student questions directly, but starts with questions of its own, such as asking if the student has any ideas about how to find an answer. Then it guides them to a solution, step by step, with hints and encouragement (a positive tone is assured by its programmers). Another feature for stoking engagement allows students to ask the bot to assume the identity of historical or literary figures for chats about their life and times. Teachers, meanwhile, can tap the bot for help planning lessons and formulating assessments.\n\nNotwithstanding Khan's expansive vision of \"amazing\" personal tutors for every student on the planet, DiCerbo assigns Khanmigo a more limited teaching role. When students are working independently on a skill or concept but get hung up or caught in a cognitive rut, she said, \"we want to help students get unstuck.\"\n\nSome 100,000 students and teachers piloted Khanmigo this past academic year in schools nationwide, helping to flag any hallucinations the bot makes and providing tons of student-bot conversations for DiCerbo and her team to analyze.\n\n\"We look for things like summarizing, providing hints and encouraging,\" she explained. \"Does [Khanmigo] do the motivational things that human tutors do?\"\n\nThe degree to which Khanmigo has closed AI's engagement gap is not yet known. Khan Academy plans to release some summary data on student-bot interactions later this summer, according to DiCerbo. Plans for third-party researchers to assess the tutor's impact on learning will take longer.\n\nNevertheless, many tutoring experts stress the importance of building a strong relationship between tutors and students to achieve significant learning boosts. \"If a student is not motivated, or if they don't see themselves as a math person, then they're not going to have a deep conversation with an AI bot,\" said Brent Milne, the vice president of product research and development at Saga Education, a nonprofit provider of in-person tutoring.\n\nSince 2021, Saga has been a partner in the Personalized Learning Initiative (PLI), run by the University of Chicago's Education Lab, to help scale high-dosage tutoring -- generally defined as one-on-one or small group sessions for at least 30 minutes every day. The PLI team sees a big and growing role for AI in tutoring, one that augments but doesn't replicate human efforts.\n\nFor instance, Saga has been experimenting with AI feedback to help tutors better engage and motivate students. Working with researchers from the University of Memphis and the University of Colorado, the Saga team fed transcripts of their math tutoring sessions into an AI model trained to recognize when the tutor was prompting students to explain their reasoning, refine their answers or initiate a deeper discussion. The AI analyzed how often each tutor took these steps.\n\nWhen Saga piloted this AI tool in 2023, the nonprofit provided the feedback to their tutor coaches, who worked with four to eight tutors each. Tracking some 2,300 tutoring sessions over several weeks, they found that tutors whose coaches used the AI feedback peppered their sessions with significantly more of these prompts to encourage student engagement.\n\nWhile Saga is looking into having AI deliver some feedback directly to tutors, it's doing so cautiously, because, according to Milne, \"having a human coach in the loop is really valuable to us.\"\n\nRelated: How AI could transform the way schools test kids\n\nIn addition to using AI to help train tutors, the Saga team wondered if they could offload certain tutor tasks to a machine without compromising the strong relationship between tutors and students. Specifically, they understood that tutoring sessions were typically a mix of teaching concepts and practicing them, according to Milne. A tutor might spend some time explaining the why and how of factoring algebraic equations, for example, and then guide a student through practice problems. But what if the tutor could delegate the latter task to AI, which excels at providing precisely targeted adaptive practice problems and hints?\n\nThe Saga team tested the idea in their algebra tutoring sessions during the 2023-24 school year. They found that students who were tutored daily in a group of two had about the same gains in math scores as students who were tutored in a group of four with assistance from ALEKS, an AI-powered learning software by McGraw Hill. In the group of four, two students worked directly with the tutor and two with the AI, switching each day. In other words, the AI assistance effectively doubled the reach of the tutor.\n\nExperts expect that AI's role in education is bound to grow, and its interactions will continue to seem more and more human. Earlier this year, OpenAI and the startup Hume AI separately launched \"emotionally intelligent\" AI that analyzes tone of voice and facial expressions to infer a user's mood and respond with calibrated \"empathy.\" Nevertheless, even emotionally intelligent AI will likely fall short on the student engagement front, according to Brown University computer science professor Michael Littman, who is also the National Science Foundation's division director for information and intelligent systems.\n\nNo matter how human-like the conversation, he said, students understand at a fundamental level that AI doesn't really care about them, what they have to say in their writing or whether they pass or fail algebra. In turn, students will never really care about the bot and what it thinks. A June study in the journal \"Learning and Instruction\" found that AI can already provide decent feedback on student essays. What is not clear is whether student writers will put in care and effort -- rather than offloading the task to a bot -- if AI becomes the primary audience for their work.\n\n\"There's incredible value in the human relationship component of learning,\" Littman said, \"and when you just take humans out of the equation, something is lost.\"", "source": {"uri": "hechingerreport.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hechinger Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_berdik@hechingerreport.org", "name": "Chris Berdik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IBM Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Clark_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron Clark Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khan Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeopardy!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kangaroo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socrates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Techno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sal Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L._Littman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael L.

Criminals are reportedly posting AI-generated job listings to dupe unsuspecting job seekers.\n\nThe Identity Theft Resource Center released the Trends in Identity Report, highlighting information gathered from victims throughout the year.\n\nJob and employment scams were discovered to be predominantly carried out on websites such as LinkedIn and job search platforms. Scammers often pose as recruiters and produce phony job postings to entice those searching for jobs.

Only last week, cybersecurity experts warned that AI posed a huge risk to security after discovering that AI chatbots might soon easily trick people.\n\nJavvad, KnowBe4's main security awareness advocate, believes people will acclimate to artificial intelligence. That might make them less defensive, allowing AI more influence over us.\n\nScientists claimed earlier this year that AI has mastered \"deception\" and learned ways to \"cheat\" people. Additionally, experts have informed outlets that hackers may \"manipulate\" AI.\n\nJavvad warns that as people get more comfortable with AI chatbots, they may become more open to every response. According to cybersecurity advocates, training, awareness, and education are required to protect against these threats.\n\nThe rapid progress of AI is a significant contributing cause of the problem. Furthermore, it is difficult for the typical person to remain current on improvements and be aware of potential hazards, which, according to Javvad, exposes everyday people.\n\nEven more concerning are fresh revelations that show AI bots may now steal a user's login credentials by making unusual calls to their targets.

Still, some tech companies and Republicans are seeking to derail the use of the Defense Production Act according to reporting from Politico. The Washington Post has also reported on efforts from Silicon Valley to undo Biden rules on AI under a possible Trump win.\n\nBut \"I think you will see that if you actually get down in the details... a lot of people will actually agree with what is in the executive order,\" said Kaushik, who characterized the executive order as largely being focused on \"information gathering\" as opposed to the creation of new regulatory burdens.\n\nIpsos polling last fall found that over 70% of Democrats and Republicans supported many of the initiatives in the executive order, such as developing standards, tools and tests to make sure that AI systems are safe, secure and trustworthy.\n\nPolicies to expand the ability of highly-skilled immigrants to come to the United States saw less Republican support -- 39% -- as did policies to address AI in criminal justice and healthcare contexts and increase funding for AI research.\n\nAdam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that the GOP platform \"is an unsurprising response to the Biden administration's move to exert so much unilateral authority over AI policy through a massive 110-page executive order.\"\n\n\"That move quickly politicized this issue and derailed the bipartisan momentum for legislative action, which had been growing until then,\" he said. \"The White House should have worked with Congress on AI policy before blazing its own regulatory trail.\"\n\nAs for a potential Trump White House repealing the order, agencies would have to go through rulemaking to revoke any final rules that have been put in place following the Biden order, said Kaushik, who said that any revocation of the order could also have implications for future policymaking. Congress has yet to take any substantial action to legislate around the technology.\n\n\"If we do away with the information gathering pieces of the executive order, then we won't really have the right information to go out and engage in the next steps of designing good regulation or designing good legislation around this,\" said Kaushik.\n\nA tech trade association source, who asked not to be named so that they could speak freely, told Nextgov/FCW that it could be difficult to reverse the order because many deadlines for requirements have already passed. With the exception of the ongoing reporting requirements under the Defense Production Act, \"the impact will likely be inconsequential,\" they said.\n\nAmong the remaining deadlines are requirements to align government contracts with the AI guidance by late September. Other requirements aren't due until June of next year.\n\nDavid Brody, managing attorney for the Digital Justice Initiative at the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, pointed to the benefits from the administration's guidance to federal agencies on their own use of AI.\n\n\"The AI EO requires federal agencies to examine the algorithmic systems that they use and to test them for inappropriate biases,\" he said in a statement. \"If this EO is revoked, agencies will be flying blind as to whether their algorithmic systems actually work as intended or are merely making decisions based on race or sex.\"\n\nBrian Chen, policy director at nonprofit Data & Society, also panned the idea of rolling the order back, calling it \"an abysmal policy decision\" in a statement.\n\n\"AI is harming people now, foreclosing opportunities and undermining their rights and freedoms in the workplace, schools, the housing market, the financial sector, the criminal legal system, and at the border,\" he said.\n\nThe RNC did not provide additional information about why the platform calls for the repeal of the order specifically and what AI policies the party does support.

These are the cornerstones of modern manufacturing. But how do you achieve them consistently in a world that demands ever-increasing production rates?\n\nEnter Automated AI Visual Inspection.\n\nIt's revolutionizing the industry, setting new standards for accuracy, reducing downtime, and cutting costs.\n\nIt's not just about spotting defects; it's about understanding production trends, predicting equipment failures before they happen, and providing insights that drive better decisions.\n\nReady to explore how AI can transform your manufacturing process? Let's dive into the benefits, challenges, and the future of Automated AI Visual Inspection.\n\nKey Notes\n\nWhat is Automated AI Visual Inspection?\n\nVisual inspection in manufacturing involves examining products or equipment for defects or deviations from expected standards. Traditionally, this process was manual, relying on human inspectors, which was slow and sometimes inaccurate.\n\nEnter Automated AI visual inspection systems: these advanced tools use cameras and computer vision to detect anomalies faster and more reliably than the human eye can.\n\nAI vision systems are equipped with machine learning algorithms that learn from thousands of images. This learning process allows them to identify even minor irregularities that might go unnoticed by a human. As these systems continue to learn, their efficiency in identifying defects improves, making them invaluable in production environments.\n\nBenefits of Automated AI Visual Inspection for Manufacturing\n\nEnhanced Accuracy and Quality Control\n\nAI visual inspection systems use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect defects more precisely than human inspectors. This heightened accuracy helps ensure that products meet quality standards consistently, reducing the risk of defects.\n\nIncreased Production Speed\n\nBy automating the inspection process, these systems can operate continuously without fatigue, allowing for faster inspection cycles that align with production speeds.\n\nThis contributes to higher throughput and more efficient use of production lines.\n\nReduced Costs\n\nAI-driven inspections can significantly reduce the costs associated with manual inspections, including labor costs and the expenses tied to human error. Over time, these savings can offset the initial investment in AI technologies.\n\nProactive Maintenance and Downtime Reduction\n\nWith predictive maintenance capabilities, AI systems can forecast equipment failures before they occur, allowing for timely repairs that prevent costly downtimes. This maintains production continuity and enhances machinery lifespan.\n\nAdaptability and Scalability\n\nAI systems can quickly adapt to new production requirements or changes in product designs without extensive retraining or reprogramming, unlike traditional inspection systems. This scalability makes them ideal for industries experiencing rapid innovation or varying production cycles.\n\nData-Driven Insights\n\nBeyond detecting defects, AI visual inspection systems can collect and analyze data over time, offering insights into production trends, process inefficiencies, and potential areas for improvement. These insights can drive better decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nThe Role of AI in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nIn semiconductor manufacturing, the processes of layering and etching chips require precise control, as discrepancies as small as a few nanometers can cause big losses. AI systems in these environments monitor the production process closely, ensuring adherence to design specifications and significantly reducing waste.\n\nAI also contributes to optimizing the manufacturing process. It adjusts parameters in real-time to adapt to changing conditions, enhancing overall production efficiency.\n\nIntegration Challenges\n\nIntegrating AI-driven visual inspection systems into manufacturing processes is a significant step toward increased efficiency and precision. However, it comes with its set of challenges. Here are some integration hurdles manufacturers may face:\n\nChallenge: Older manufacturing equipment cannot often support modern AI systems, necessitating costly and disruptive upgrades.\n\nSolution: Implementing interface adapters or middleware can facilitate communication between AI systems and older equipment, reducing the need for complete system overhauls.\n\nAdditionally, choosing AI system providers who offer solutions designed to work with existing hardware can minimize the need for extensive modifications.\n\nChallenge: Effective AI systems require robust frameworks for handling large volumes of data while ensuring security against breaches.\n\nSolution: Opting for on-premise data storage and processing can give manufacturers more control over data security, reduce reliance on external clouds, and minimize vulnerability to external breaches.\n\nChallenge: The upfront costs for implementing an AI system can be steep, covering system purchases, infrastructure upgrades, and training, necessitating clear ROI calculations.\n\nSolution: Starting with a pilot project can help demonstrate the potential cost savings and efficiency gains, providing a clearer picture of the ROI.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the difference between traditional and AI-driven visual inspection?\n\nTraditional visual inspection relies on human oversight, which can be slow and sometimes inaccurate. AI-driven visual inspection uses machine learning and computer vision to automate and enhance accuracy and speed.\n\nWhat are the benefits of predictive maintenance in manufacturing?\n\nPredictive maintenance helps anticipate equipment failures, allowing for timely interventions that prevent costly downtimes and extend machinery life.\n\nCan AI visual inspection systems be integrated into any manufacturing line?\n\nYes, AI visual inspection systems are versatile and can be customized to fit different manufacturing environments.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutomated AI visual inspection is not just enhancing manufacturing; it's redefining it. As industries worldwide strive to meet growing demands for precision and efficiency, embracing AI technologies is not merely an option -- it's a necessity.\n\nHowever, integrating these advanced systems into existing frameworks presents challenges, including compatibility with legacy systems, data management, and initial investment concerns. By addressing these effectively, manufacturers can fully leverage AI to exceed the rigorous demands of modern production environments.", "source": {"uri": "technology.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Product design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor device fabrication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanometre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-premises software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Calibration_and_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Calibration and Testing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Manufacturing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Manufacturing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Factory_Automation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Factory Automation", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/automotive-car-manufacturing-720x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

What if powerful AI models are used to help foreign adversaries or terror groups build chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons?\n\nThe department's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office, led by Assistant Secretary Mary Ellen Callahan, issued a report to President Joe Biden that was released to the public in June, with recommendations about how to rein in the worst threats from AI. Among other things, the report recommends building consensus across agencies, developing safe harbor measures to incentivize reporting vulnerabilities to the government without fear of prosecution, and developing new guidelines for handling sensitive scientific data.\n\nWe spoke to Callahan about the report, how concerned she actually is, and how her office is using AI to further its own goals while trying to outline the risks of the technology.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nGZERO: We profile a lot of AI tools - some benign, some very scary from a privacy or disinformation perspective. But when it comes to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons, what do you see as the main threats?\n\nMary Ellen Callahan: AI is going to lower barriers to entry for all actors, including malign actors. The crux of this report is to look for ways to increase the promise of artificial intelligence, particularly with chemical and biological innovation, while limiting the perils, finding that kind of right balance between the containment of risk and fostering innovation.\n\nWe're talking in one breath about chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats -- they're all very different. Is there one that you're most concerned about or see as most urgent?\n\nI don't want to give away too many secrets in terms of where the threats are. Although the task from the president was chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear threats, we focus primarily on chemical and biological threats for two reasons: One, chemical and biological innovation that is fostered by artificial intelligence is further along, and two, chemical and biological formulas and opportunities have already been included in some AI models.\n\nAnd also because relatedly, the Department of Energy, which has a specialization in radiological and nuclear threats, is doing a separate classified report.\n\nSo, that's less about the severity of the problem and more about what we'll face soonest, right?\n\nWell, anything that's a WMD threat is low probability, but high impact. So we're concerned about these at all times, but in terms of the AI implementation, the chemical and biological are more mature, I'd say.\n\nHow has the rise of AI changed the focus of your job? And is there anything about AI that keeps you up at night?\n\nI would actually say that I am more sanguine now, having done a deeper dive into AI. One, we're early in the stages of artificial intelligence development, and so we can catch this wave earlier. Two, there is a lot of interest and encouragement with regard to the model developers working with us proactively. There are chokepoints: The physical creation of these threats remains hard. How do you take it from ideation to execution? And there are a lot of steps between now and then.\n\nAnd so what we're trying to build into this guidance for AI model developers and others is pathway defeat -- to try to develop off-ramps where we can defeat the adversaries, maybe early in their stage, maybe early as they are dealing with the ideation, [so they're] not even able to get a new formula, or maybe at different stages of the development of a threat.\n\nHow are you thinking about the threat of open-source AI models that are published online for anyone to access?\n\nWe talked a little bit about open-source, but that wasn't the focus of the report. But, I think that the more important thing to focus on is the sources of the ingestion of the data - as I mentioned, there is already public source data related to biology and to chemistry. And so whether or not it is an open-source model or not, it's the content of the models that I'm more focused on.\n\nHow do you feel about the pace of regulation in this country versus the pace of innovation?\n\nWe're not looking at regulations to be a panacea here. What we're trying to do right now is to make sure that everyone understands they have a stake in making artificial intelligence as safe as possible, and really to develop a culture of responsibility throughout this whole process -- using a bunch of different levers. One lever is the voluntary commitments.\n\nAnother lever is the current laws. The current US regime between export controls, privacy, technology transfer, intellectual property, all of those can be levers and can be used in different ways. Obviously, we need to work with our international allies and make sure that we are working together on this. I don't want to reveal too much, but there is interest that there can be some allied response in terms of establishing best practices.\n\nSecretary Alejandro Mayorkas has noted that regulation can be backward-looking and reactive and might not keep up with the pace of technology. So, therefore, we're not suggesting or asking for any new authorities or regulations in the first instance. But if we identify gaps, we may revisit whether new authorities or laws are needed.\n\nIn terms of legislation, do you think you have what you need to do your job? Or are there clear gaps in what's on the books?\n\nI actually think that the diverse nature of our laws is actually a benefit and we can really leverage and make a lot of progress with even what we have on the books now -- export controls, technology transfers, intellectual property, criminal behavior, and obviously if we have CFATS on the books, that would be great -- the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards from my friends at CISA. But we do have a lot of robust levers that we can use now. And even those voluntary commitments with the model developers saying they want to do it -- if they don't comply with that, there could even be civil penalties related to that.\n\nCan you tell me about the safe harbor measure that your report recommends and how you want that to work?\n\nThere are two aspects to the safe harbor. One is having an \"if you see something, say something\" aspect. So that means people in labs, people who are selling products, people who say stuff like, \"that doesn't ring true.\" This standard can be used as a culture of responsibility.\n\nAnd if somebody does report, then there could be a safe harbor reporting element -- whether they've done something inadvertently to create a new novel threat, or they've noticed something in the pipeline. The safe harbor for abstaining from civil or criminal prosecution -- that may need regulation.\n\nAre you using AI at all in your office?\n\nYep. Actually, we are using AI on a couple of different detection platforms. The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office has the subject matter expertise for CBRN threats here in the department and we provide training, technology, equipment, and detection capability. So we've been using algorithms and AI to help refine our algorithms with regard to identifying radiological, nuclear, chemical, and biological threats. And we're going to continue to use that. We also are using AI as part of our biosurveillance program as well, both in trying to identify if there is a biodetection threat out there, but also if there is information that would indicate a biological threat out there in the country, and we're trying to use AI to look for that in content.\n\nLet's end on an optimistic note. Is there anything else that gives you hope about AI factoring into your work?\n\nThe promise of AI is extraordinary. It really is going to be a watershed moment for us, and I'm really excited about this. I think thinking about the safety and security of the chemical and biological threats at this moment is exactly the right time. We've got to get in there early enough to establish these standards, these protocols, to share guidance, to fold in risk assessments into these calculations for the model developers, but also for the public at large. So I'm fairly bullish on this now.", "source": {"uri": "gzeromedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GZERO Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Callahan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mary Ellen Callahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBRN_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBRN defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safe harbor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Containment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.gzeromedia.com/media-library/image.png?id=52557566&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=38%2C0%2C38%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

By integrating with OpenShift, Run:ai provides a robust solution, enabling seamless management of AI resources and infrastructure.\n\n\"With Red Hat in particular, really strong opportunities to partner because the Run:ai solution we run on top of Kubernetes and OpenShift Kubernetes is widely adopted within the enterprise,\" said Sam Heywood (pictured), vice president of product marketing at Run:ai Labs USA Inc. \"So we leverage that. And then if you think about the development and the MLOps and all those types of things, OpenShift AI, we just announced a new collaboration with Red Hat on that.\"\n\nHeywood spoke with theCUBE Research principal analyst Rob Strechay at Red Hat Summit, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's livestreaming studio. They discussed the transformative potential of AI when supported by robust, integrated infrastructure solutions such as Run:ai's offering. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nKnown for its expertise in AI infrastructure and graphical processing unit orchestration, Run:ai has deepened its partnership with Red Hat, particularly by integrating with OpenShift AI. The synergy between Run:ai's GPU orchestration and OpenShift as a Kubernetes orchestration platform aims to provide seamless and efficient enterprise AI solutions, leveraging both companies' strengths, according to Heywood.\n\n\"When you start talking about AI within the enterprise, at the end of the day, the products and the technology need to deliver the promised capabilities,\" he said. \"But what I'm seeing is enterprises also looking for deep expertise. Sure, you could go buy Run:ai -- sure, you could go OpenShift, but bringing the two teams together and providing the opportunity for joint solutioning around the customer problem is a big value add.\"\n\nThe partnership also addresses the sustainability concerns of AI resource management and infrastructure. By utilizing fractional GPUs, Run:ai enables more efficient use of resources, reducing over-provisioning and ensuring that data scientists and researchers have the necessary tools without unnecessary excess. This approach drives cost savings and accelerates critical AI initiatives, ensuring that infrastructure use aligns with business priorities, Heywood added.\n\n\"What we're there to do is ensure that [companies] have proper support for the critical initiatives and that they're confident that the way that infrastructure is being used maps back to their highest priorities,\" he concluded.\n\nHere's the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE Research's coverage of Red Hat Summit:", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenShift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kubernetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orchestration (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLOps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (supercomputer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Process_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Process Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/IMG_2822-e1720541916967.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

He was never too explicit, very much in line with his comments to the press, but he did mention one thing that he was absolutely right about: Apple Intelligence stands out in something that no other company has.\n\nThe key to the success of Apple Intelligence lies not only in the capabilities of the technology itself, which are certainly impressive, but in how it is used and integrated into the devices and services we use in our daily lives. Apple's AI is present in all aspects of the operating system, from photos to applications, through screen content, and beyond. This deep integration allows for a smooth and consistent user experience, something that other companies have not achieved with the same mastery.\n\nApple has created an environment where AI, whether it's Apple Intelligence or ChatGPT through its integration with iOS 18, can interact directly and effectively with the system and even with third-party applications. Developers have access to tools that allow them to integrate advanced AI functionalities into apps without having to reinvent the wheel. A seemingly simple gesture that opens the door to new possibilities that were previously unthinkable.\n\nWhile Google has done an admirable job integrating AI into Android, there are still significant differences in the depth and effectiveness of this integration compared to Apple. In Android, although AI is present and Google is responsible for the operating system and the AI itself, ecosystem fragmentation, device variability, and the spectrum of third-party app design limit its effectiveness.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is responsible for both the hardware and software, and when it comes to apps, the App Store guidelines provide a consistent experience from APIs to design language. Starting from here, we are talking about convenience.\n\nIt is clear that we can open the ChatGPT app on our iPhone today to ask a question, but it's one step further. Copying the text from an email and asking GPT to correct it? Who does that? Now with iOS 18, this correction will be just a single tap away.\n\nThe importance of AI does not only lie in its capabilities, but in how it integrates into our daily lives and in each of our tasks. The most advanced technology has no value if it cannot be used in an extremely intuitive and effective way. I believe that Apple has understood this from the beginning and has focused its design and structure on making AI accessible and useful for everyone in what matters to all of us.\n\nApple Intelligence is responsible, on the device, for deciding how to process each request. From direct processing to querying ChatGPT to Apple's private cloud computing, efficiency is at the core of every interaction. If we add to that the fact that Google Gemini and Claude could also be integrated into iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia -- although not Meta -- and enjoy the same flexibility and frictionless experience, we are, as we started saying, facing something that no other company has.\n\nTim Cook was right. The integration of AI into the Apple ecosystem is unparalleled, not only because of its technical capabilities, but also because of how it has been designed to continuously and almost invisibly enhance and enrich the user experience.

He talked about how he met MIT professor Patrick Winston in the early days of the 21st century, and then started using AI for sound and video production, ultimately going on to get involved in the Beats company.\n\n\"I'm a musician because of the computer,\" he said, describing coding and computer science as his early career aspirations, and talking about the intersection of tech and music.\n\nIn describing how AI has evolved, he talked about these early pioneers telling him that someday people would use language to talk to computers, instead of programming.\n\nThose days, he noted, have now arrived.\n\n\"The concept of LLMs, we didn't have that then,\" he said. will.i.am described bringing something to his band in 2010 in a briefcase, showing them the potential of the nascent tech and saying \"I've got the future right here.\"\n\nLots of fans, he said, are familiar with the Black Eyed Peas lyric: \"I'm so 3008, you're so 2000 and late,\" but that line, he added, was driven by the idea that we are embarking on this voyage toward innovation quickly.\n\n\"I'm a curious person,\" he told Rus, explaining how he got in on AI on the ground floor. \"I like asking questions.\"\n\nIt occurred to him early on, he explained, that with the potential of machines, a lot of human activity would ultimately become obsolete.\n\n\"Why am I over here creating, when I can I can create something that creates?\" he said.\n\nwill.i.am explained how he started investing in AI with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, and\n\nHow he is now the CEO of FYI.AI. He keyed in a demo for the audience, starting with an AI responding to an avatar of Bob Marley. His AI respondent used the phrase \"imagination in action,\" which I thought was great (listen closely) but the quality of the conversation was amazing.\n\nHere's a part of the AI's thoughts aimed at promoting diversity and democratizing tech:\n\n\"It's about showing every damn body that tech ain't just for the select few. It's about putting voices like ours in the mix, making sure black women and peeps from the inner city can see themselves reflected in this tech revolution. Cha. It's about empowerment, showing that AI can speak our language, understand our struggles and amplify our stories. When folks see an AI (like this, it) bridges gaps, makes tech relatable and dismantles the notion that something as powerful as AI is out of reach for you. It's about inclusivity, breaking barriers and making damn sure that the future looks like every damn body.\"\n\nWhen asked how the company achieves this, will.i.am said FYI uses natural speaking voices instead of voice actors.\n\nHe also talked about how he runs a show with an AI named Fiona.\n\n\"People can engage with that costar every day,\" he said, \"one to a million, not that limited experience that we currently have with traditional media.\"\n\nDoing away with stilted conversation training, he suggested, gives you that real aspect that draws people in.\n\n\"They were blown away by how the AI feels when you communicate,\" he said, describing an interview with De La Soul, when Rus asked how the guests respond to talking to an AI. \"It's a superstar. It is the star. It's not just a tool.\"\n\nGoing into more of what comprises FYI's \"secret sauce,\" he suggested part of the technique involves \"puppeteering\" the model, but that natural language helps, too.\n\n\"You can't (make the training data) like it was writing a book,\" he said, contrasting FYI's personas to traditional models trained more formally, which he characterized as \"super stale\" and \"super bland\" because of a lack of conversational authenticity. \"The magic is how we gathered and recorded,\n\n\"We just had real conversations, with all the 'ums' and the 'ahs', instead of like, 'perfect' ... and then two, the LLM has no clue that it's speaking - it thinks it's being read.\"\n\nWith that said, he went into a lot more detail about how the LLM works with something he called TTS, a text-based component, and how to trail-blaze making those models vibrant.\n\nYour imagination is doing all of the coloring when you're reading text. ... does a machine have imagination? No, it doesn't. ... so how do you get it to express? You've got to break the conventional text, and reading, and you have to start to think differently.\"\n\nAnother interesting part of will.i.am's interview was where he went through a survey of the history of music in the modern world, starting with the old days before things like recording and touring. I think this is interesting and important enough to showcase in some detail:\n\nOf the late 1800s: \"I'm a musician, I would play in some orchestra or some band, in theaters and classical music, there's no, I can't even imagine a music industry. There's no such thing as a music industry. There's no such thing as radio. There's no such thing as vinyl. There's no such thing as this current state of song structure. Songs were for telling stories (that) you composed for conductors to conduct an orchestra. So popular music is not today's concept of popular music.\"\n\nOf earlier ages before people had common recordings: \"People listen to music at church. They listen to music at the theater, but do they all sing the same lyric, randomly, as they're cleaning the house? That wasn't the experience. What did that? The recording industry did that. Every single industry when it comes to music, was because of some piece of technology. 1449, because of the printing press, shortly after that, you had your Mozart, your Bachs, your Beethovens, those folks have wrote composed because you can print sheet music for conductors to conduct and sell more oboes, ... and all these different instruments to play the music that was printed in the sheet music, that was the first industry.\"\n\nOf the recording era, in the 1900s: \"You have your rights, your mechanical rights, or contracts. A song is four minutes and some odd seconds. Anything over six minutes is part one and part two. Look at every jazz composition. Any song over six minutes is part two, because that's the amount of information that fit on lacquer. It's a limitation.\"\n\nThen, bringing things up to date, he talked about the changes that AI is likely to usher in quickly.\n\nNow we have new tech. So should this new tech be a part of recording tech? That would be idiotic. Why would you put abundance and infinite possibilities on an industry that's based on limitations. Why would you make AI make this type of music? A recording? Something that exists in a cage, a trap container, for three minutes?\"\n\nThere's a moment where he talks about a live musician or AI speaking directly to people in a crowd, another unprecedented use of tech in music. He explained some of the dynamics, vicarious aspects, of an audience that AI might have an impact on:\n\n\"We have an affection to love songs because it's a proximity to our love. It's not our actual love. We love heartbreak songs because it's a proximity to heartbreak. It's not your heartbreak. It's my heartbreak. I just shared my heartbreak with you, and you're like, 'Oh yeah, it kind of feels like my situation.' That's not your situation. We like party music, .... now you go to the club, and when you're in the club, the songs are like, 'we're in the club.' It's telling you what you're doing. Like, 'yeah, we are at the club. We're about to drink. Oh my gosh, this song is so on point,' but it's proximity. It's not your actual (experience).\"\n\nNow, he said, we can make music more personalized, less vicarious, more direct.\n\n\"Let's make this thing do something new,\" he said. \"Let's make it make your actual heartbreak. Let's make it alive. What's your song?\"\n\nHowever, he said, it's critical that people own their own data.\n\n\"There's this broken practice,\" he added, \"we gave all of our data to these data monarchies.\"\n\nHe also made a good analogy of people's data to their nervous systems, or digestive systems. You can't trade those other things around, he noted - so why data?\n\nThe challenge to humans, he added, is widespread.\n\n\"It's not just Frank Sinatra,\" he said, describing how AI can be trained on human endeavors, and what that might mean for the average person. \"It's your next door neighbor. ... If you can simulate a building to not fall down in an earthquake, then you can simulate how somebody sells, how somebody loves, how nurses take care of someone, how people rap, all of their cadences...people need to own their stuff.\"\n\nIn that vein, he also discussed his ongoing efforts to prepare new generations with a foundation started in 2008, College Track, that started with 65 students, but grew to 13,000 students headed for a variety of schools.\n\n\"Our students always aim to come to MIT,\" he said. \"It's hard to get into, but our kids are, every single year, aiming to do that, especially the kids that are focused on computer science. ... MIT is a special place, not only for me and my interest in AI, what sparked my interest in AI, but my passion and our purpose. ... Our program that we tweaked is one of the most successful programs with how many schools that we have adopted in a school district, so 400 robotics teams serving over 13,000 students. Now we just want to continue to grow all that, to prepare the youth for tomorrow.\"\n\nSpeaking of opportunity and challenge, Will.i.am acknowledged the point that we are at with AI. \"It's a new renaissance,\" he said. \"Humanity has these waves ... this one's an important one. It'll change how we solve diseases, climate...I remain optimistic, I remain inspired by the engineers and the folks who have been working in this field before it was cool, before the hype, people who were building LLMs in the shadows, I salute those folks.\"\n\nHis call for kind and compassionate results was inspirational:\n\n\"There are a lot of companies that are trying to get into AGI; what type of AGI are they getting into? Is it empathetic? Is it kind? Or is it analytical and judging?...I want to get to that, something that's empathetic, that gives you the notion that you're loved, that it cares ... there's a lot of lonely people out there. You have a lot of people who are afraid of the field out there. And when you get this job displacement, there's going to be a lot of people that need to feel loved. ... It's imagination in action.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will.i.am", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will.i.am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus'", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kievan Rus'"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Eyed_Peas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Eyed Peas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_L._Rus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniela L.

Particularly in the realm of customer support, AI tools like ChatGPT can serve as powerful allies. Customer Support Representatives (CSRs) face high demands to respond efficiently and effectively to customer queries. By leveraging AI, these professionals can enhance their productivity, ensure quicker response times, and ultimately deliver superior customer service.\n\nOne of the primary uses of ChatGPT is to automate routine customer interactions. Common queries such as order status updates, password resets, and basic troubleshooting can be handled by AI, freeing up CSRs to tackle more complex issues that require a human touch.\n\nGenerating Accurate and Fast Responses\n\nChatGPT can assist in drafting rapid yet accurate responses to customer queries. Whether a customer needs information on product specifications or billing inquiries, ChatGPT can comb through a knowledge base and craft a response in a fraction of the time it would take a human representative.\n\nReal-time Translation Assistance\n\nFor multinational companies, language barriers can be a significant challenge. ChatGPT can instantly translate messages, enabling CSRs to communicate effortlessly with customers from different linguistic backgrounds. This opens the door to more personalized and inclusive support.\n\nHere are a couple of prompts that can help Customer Support Representatives:\n\nTools like Zendesk and Freshdesk now incorporate AI features to prioritize tickets based on urgency and topic. These systems can automatically categorize and route tickets to the appropriate department or representative, reducing resolution times substantially.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nAI-powered sentiment analysis tools can gauge a customer's emotional state. By analyzing text for signs of frustration or satisfaction, CSRs can tailor their responses to fit the emotional needs of the customer, delivering more empathetic and effective support.\n\nFuture advancements in AI will lead to even more proactive customer service. Intelligent systems will predict customer needs and resolve issues before the customer is even aware of them. This will be a game-changer in enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nPersonalized Customer Interactions\n\nFuture AI developments will enable highly personalized interactions. Machine learning algorithms will analyze past customer interactions to offer customized solutions and recommendations, ensuring every customer feels valued and understood.\n\nWhy Learning AI is Crucial for Customer Support Representatives\n\nTo thrive in an AI-driven world, Customer Support Representatives must adapt and integrate AI tools into their daily operations. AI isn't here to replace jobs but to transform them. CSRs who are proficient in using AI will outperform those who are not, becoming essential assets to their organizations.\n\nWith AI, representatives can handle more queries in less time, leaving room for more complex problem-solving and customer relationship-building activities. This not only makes them more productive but also opens up opportunities for career advancement and higher earnings.

Overestimating the near term, underestimating the long term, Gartner's latest \"Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence\" report already has us mired in disillusionment about cloud AI services.\n\nAnd yet, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn writes so eloquently in his new book, Mastering AI, we're clearly on the precipice of having our lives transformed by technology that can heighten or threaten the essence of who we are. As he told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell at his book launch in New York last night, humans have long harnessed the power of animals and technologies that exceed our physical power. \"We never really defined ourselves as a species based on brawn,\" he said. AI, on the other hand, \"challenges what makes us unique as a species, which is really our intelligence.\"\n\nThose of you who read Jeremy's articles or his Eye on AI newsletter know that he's attuned to both the potential and the perils of AI. After almost a decade of covering cutting-edge technologies, he's a master at connecting the dots. What I found most thought-provoking about his book, and his comments last night, is the potential consequence of outsourcing too much to any technology. We've already seen what our current tools have done to our abilities to remember phone numbers or navigate city streets, never mind its impact on public trust and mental health.\n\nWill AI enhance our expertise or ultimately diminish it?\n\nTake, for example, the fact that ChatGPT can take our ideas and mold them into an argument. \"Writing and thinking are not separable activities,\" Jeremy argued. \"I think when you lose your writing ability, you actually lose your thinking ability to some extent.\" And if we outsource judgement, he added, \"we will lose the ability to think critically.\"\n\nAnd yet, of course, the potential for AI to unleash creativity and innovation is immense. Maybe that's why the book's subtitle is \"a survival guide to our superpowered future.\" Here you can read an excerpt about how AI -- with its hidden biases -- may already be shaping how you think.\n\nThe greatest protection against losing ourselves to any algorithm is the human act of connection and conversation. Jeremy and my colleagues will no doubt debate these shifts with Fortune 500 leaders, founders, investors and other stakeholders next week at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah. Recognizing the scale and transformative impact of AI across all parts of society, we're also bringing together leaders from business, government and academia later this month for Fortune Brainstorm AI in Singapore, and again in December for Fortune Brainstorm AI in San Francisco.\n\nBut history is what happens on the ground, in rooms where we don't always get to go. I'm curious about your own experiences with AI. Is it over-hyped, under-appreciated -- or both?\n\nStartups like Noom and Calibrate promise customers that they can take a weight-loss drug like Ozempic temporarily-and make them thin permanently. That's attractive to patients, who aren't keen on taking a drug permanently, in part due to cost. Yet doctors say the so-called metabolic reset isn't real, as people quickly regain weight once they stop taking Ozempic or Zepbound. Fortune\n\nCan chatbots influence what you believe?\n\nWhile right-wing commentators (and Tesla CEO Elon Musk) criticize Big Tech's chatbots like ChatGPT as explicitly promoting a \"woke\" ideology, the truth is that AI's influence on users is more subtle, Fortune's Jeremy Kahn argues. Cornell University researchers found that an AI bot with a hidden point of view successfully shifted a user's beliefs. \"You may not even know that you are being influenced,\" warns Mor Naaman, a senior researcher on the study. Fortune\n\nBanking on remote work\n\nSallie Krawcheck, CEO of female-focused investment platform Ellevest, is sticking with her all-remote policy even as the rest of the financial industry calls people back to the office. She notes that giving up a fixed office space allowed Ellevest to hire from anywhere in the country. Krawchek also argues that remote work is good for gender equality: \"Particularly for women who have kids, [it's valuable to] keep the kids at school in whatever city they're in,\" she says.

Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves have voiced concerns over the rapid advancement and potential misuse of these technologies, advocating for safeguards to protect actors and the artistic integrity of filmmaking.\n\nTom Cruise, in a recent address to the Screen Actors Guild\u2010American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), expressed his apprehensions about the pace of AI development and its potential impact on actors' livelihoods. He called for better regulations and compensation for those affected by AI and deepfakes.\n\nKeanu Reeves, known for his roles in \"The Matrix\" and \"John Wick,\" echoed similar sentiments in an interview with Wired. He expressed reservations about the use of deepfakes, fearing they could overshadow an actor's creative input and diminish the authenticity of performances.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Harrison Ford, the legendary star of \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones,\" sees the potential of AI as a tool for enhancing storytelling. He cited the de-aging technology used in his latest film, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" as an example of how AI can open up new narrative possibilities and create a more immersive cinematic experience.\n\nThe stark contrast between these perspectives highlights the complex ethical and artistic dilemmas posed by AI in Hollywood. While some fear the potential loss of creative control and job security, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation and expanding the boundaries of storytelling.\n\nAs the debate rages on, the future of AI in Hollywood remains uncertain. Finding a balance between technological advancement and artistic integrity will be crucial for the industry's sustainable growth. Whether AI will ultimately be a boon or a bane for Hollywood is a question only time will answer.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keanu Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Television_and_Radio_Artists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Federation of Television and Radio Artists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Wick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Stunts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Stunts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/BeFunky-collage-(3)1720606121-0/BeFunky-collage-(3)1720606121-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Automation and cloud-based solutions increase the productivity of the medical staff and help to deal with the workload faster. According to the Belitsoft software development company expert Dmitry Baraishuk, business intelligence tools contribute to well-informed decisions, as data is the main asset in the healthcare industry.\n\nNarrow AI solves a particular task or problem. For example, playing chess with a computer involves interacting with a narrow AI. It knows how to play chess but will not help you with anything else. A list of recommended films on Netflix based on your personal preferences is another example.\n\nIn healthcare, narrow AI helps to read images, and scans, and detect diseases and norm alterations. Also doctors and medical experts use narrow AI for creating predictive treatment models, X-ray recognition, and reading MRI scans.\n\nGenerative AI (GenAI) performs a broad scope of functions. It is agile and adapts to the request. Most commonly known are ChatGPT and Bard, which generate content such as music, video, and images. In healthcare, GenAI creates responses to patients, develops care plans, and helps with administrative procedures.\n\nGeneral AI (AGI) can recognize emotions and feelings and demonstrate human cognitive functions. It is currently under development. An example of AGI in medicine is the clinical decision support system (CDSS). It is a system that uses patient data to diagnose, suggest treatment plans, track recovery, and assist medical staff with alerts and notifications.\n\nBonus: Super AI represents the future, in which computers can substitute humans, i.e., perform our duties and make decisions.\n\nApplying any AI solution to the internal medical system implies a \"human in the loop\" approach. It means we are still far from a situation where computers can perform tasks instead of people. Humans need to control and check the processes performed by AI-generated solutions. AI tools assist humans, saving their resources and freeing them for more challenging tasks.\n\nInterviewing a patient, taking notes about their health history and symptoms, and then transforming those notes into a standardized medical record takes doctors a long time. With AI-powered apps, medical staff can perform those tasks in minutes. A general practitioner dictates the data to the app while interviewing a patient. The system transforms speech into written records and notifies the doctor of missed fields. Later, the doctor can check the information on the computer, add any other relevant facts by voice or typing, and submit the information to the EHR system. The data can be updated in the system at any time.\n\nSimilarly to the previous point, GenAI assists in insurance plans checking, approving, and denying reimbursement. Insurance authorization and claim processing take, on average, ten days. First, a medical provider develops an approximate treatment strategy. Then, an insurance specialist checks the coverage plan and asks for any clarifications if needed. The process involves communication via email and manual input. AI-powered solutions and cloud-based EHRs allow for saving time and minimizing human errors and any bias.\n\nPatients value not only medical treatment itself but also interaction outside the hospital. Flawless service on the phone or website can help medical providers stay ahead of the competition. Machine learning technology enables medical providers to examine patients' experiences on social media and review platforms, their feedback, and complaints. Digesting such data allows AI tools to predict the best ways of customer interaction, understand the appropriate marketing funnels, and create guidelines and scripts for call center agents, chatbots, and website messengers.\n\nToday, the customer-centric approach includes the whole interaction with a medical institution, from the experience of making an appointment to the final feedback. Digital technologies help medical providers personalize this interaction and avoid general recommendations that suit all patients.\n\nAccording to Deloitte, the integration of business intelligence tools and data analytics in healthcare results in a patient-tailored approach. Doctors have access to cloud-based EHRs and make data-driven decisions regarding every case. Patients, in turn, receive a thorough diagnosis and reliable recommendations.\n\nThe possibilities that generative AI may bring to the healthcare business are blooming. GenAI improves administrative procedures and customer satisfaction. At the same time, the preparation stage is vital. Medical providers should stick to the clear-cut roadmap that includes the following steps:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weak artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_(chatbot)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bard (chatbot)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Healthcare industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical decision support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-Is-Generative-AI-Used-in-Healthcare.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is sometimes viewed as only an aid to ease human labor. However, many people are concerned that comparable \"chatbots\" might replace certain jobs.\n\nNow, what is a chatbot? a chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user. Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them.\n\nSeveral parties have banned the use of ChatGPT in various institutions, including schools. As in Australia, a spokesperson for the Queensland state Department of Education said it had banned the use of ChatGPT for students. This rejection is the result of concerns about making student assignments completely handed over to AI.\n\nSo, how do you detect texts written by ChatGPT and other AI chatbots?\n\nHow to Detect Texts Written by ChatGPT and AI Chatbots\n\nData scientist at the Mozilla Foundation, Jesse McCrosky, said that there is no easy method for detecting text written by AI. The tools currently available have limitations. \"Detection tools are always imperfect, making them virtually useless for most applications,\" McCrosky said.\n\nAccording to him, it is impossible to create an AI detection tool, because software with an artificial intelligence system can compile text created specifically to avoid this kind of detection. \"There may be a race between ChatGPT text detectors and people avoiding tracking tools, but there will never be a situation where the detectors can be completely trusted,\" he said.\n\nEven so, the Poynter Institute offers some tips for spotting misinformation in ChatGPT posts, namely checking for text patterns and inconsistencies. Additionally, readers can look for signs of errors and check the context of the writing.\n\nSites to Detect Texts Written by ChatGPT and AI Chatbots\n\nResearcher at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Md Badiuzzaman, shared platform recommendations for checking texts written by ChatGPT and other AI chatbots. Here's the list:\n\n1. OpenAI API Key\n\nThe ChatGPT development company, OpenAI actually provides a tool to detect AI text, namely the OpenAI API Key https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier. However, this tool can only be used to track text with a minimum of 1,000 characters (150-250 words). Apart from that, this tool is still being refined starting July 2023.\n\n2. GPT-2 Demo Detector\n\nReaders who feel they have found writing that indicates AI creation can use the site created by GPT-2 at https://openai-detector.hf.space. Badiuzzaman, who tested the capabilities of this platform, using texts from ChatGPT, said that 94 percent of the texts were fake. However, when he tried to insert a partial paragraph from his paper, GPT-2 said it was 99 percent original.\n\n3. GPTZero\n\nGPT Zero via the site https://app.gptzero.me/app/welcome detects confusion in an article. The ambiguity in question refers to how many possible words are suggested by the automatic algorithm. The reason is, the sentences produced by AI usually consist of similar words and phrases.\n\n4. DetectGPT\n\nThe University of Stanford launched an AI writing detection tool called DetectGPT. Internet users can use it by accessing the site https://detectgpt.ericmitcell.ai/. However, this platform is only limited to checking GPT-2 generated text.\n\n5. Writer.com\n\nHow to detect ChatGPT results can also be done via the site https://writer.com/ai-content-detector. This page can extract AI-generated text. When Badiuzzaman tried it, Writer.com identified his paper as 99 percent man-made.\n\nMELYNDA DWI PUSPITA", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TEMPO.CO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "petir_garda_bhwana@en.tempo.co", "name": "Petir Garda Bhwana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynter_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poynter Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Software", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Speech Synthesis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/05/01/id_1200699/1200699_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717719", "eventUri": "eng-9717719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

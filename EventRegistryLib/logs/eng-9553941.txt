Towns was selected from a group of five finalists for his dedication to pursuing social justice and upholding Abdul-Jabbar and the league's decades-long values of equality, respect and inclusion.\n\nTowns has been a committed advocate for voting rights, playing a pivotal role in the passage of House File 28 (Bill H.F. 28) - Minnesota's Restore the Vote bill, a bipartisan legislation that restores the right to vote to thousands of formerly incarcerated individuals. As a leader for the Timberwolves and in the community, Towns used his platform and voice in support of the bill, shining a light on inequities within the criminal justice system. He participated in meetings with key organizations and a community conversation hosted by All Square - a nonprofit in Minnesota that invests in people impacted by mass incarceration. Towns expressed the pressing need for all citizens to have a voice within our democracy and encouraged action at the polls. Towns' engagement with All Square exemplifies his passion to make an impact on issues that will help create positive change. H.F. 28 was signed into law in March 2023 and it helped restore the right to vote for more than 55,000 Minnesotans upon its implementation in July 2023 who were previously incarcerated or on parole. The passage of H.F.28 marked the largest expansion of voting rights since the voting age in Minnesota was lowered to 18 years old.\n\nIn addition to his advocacy around Restore the Vote, Towns has also used his platform to raise awareness for other critical issues within the justice and education system. Towns dedicated his time and financial support to serve as a producer for the documentary \"Forgiving Johnny,\" a short film that explores how digital transformation enables change within the justice system, following the main character Johnny and his public defender, Noah Cox, as they navigate the complex legal system. Towns also provided funding to Ava DuVernay's film \"Origin,\" and encouraged young people to experience the film and engage with reading banned books. Towns is also a board member for the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition (NBSJC), an advocacy organization formed jointly by the NBA, National Basketball Players Association and National Basketball Coaches Association in 2020 that leverages the game's influence to promote policy, build strategic partnerships, and empower action in NBA markets across the nation.\n\n\"Karl-Anthony Towns has demonstrated a deep commitment to advancing social justice through his tremendous advocacy work not only this past year, but throughout his whole career,\" said Mark Tatum, NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer. \"Whether it was the passage of the Restore the Vote legislation in Minnesota, his 'Forgiving Johnny' documentary or continued work with the Coalition, Karl's efforts have made a true impact on the lives of thousands in Minnesota and beyond.\"\n\nFinalists for the award included Miami Heat center-forward Bam Adebayo, New Orleans Pelicans guard CJ McCollum, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Lindy Waters III and LA Clippers guard Russell Westbrook.\n\nThe winner of the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion award was determined by a selection committee comprised of NBA Legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and notable social justice leaders. The selection committee includes: Director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport Dr. Richard Lapchick, National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial, UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murgu\u00eda, Rise Founder and CEO Amanda Nguyen and NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Mark Tatum.

He will be presented with the award ahead of Minnesota's game vs. Denver in the Western Conference semifinals on Friday, the Timberwolves having a chance to go up 3-0 in the series and one win away from the conference finals.\n\nThe Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award is in its fourth year with all 30 NBA teams nominating one player from their roster to be the winner. Finalists and the winner are selected by a committee composed of NBA legends, league executives and social justice leaders.

Pretty incredible that he is a four-time (and counting) All-Star in the NBA,\" Pope said. \"Those incredible on-court achievements pale in comparison to what's doing to make a difference in the world.\"\n\nTowns' honor was sparked by serving as an advocate of voting rights. He played a major role in helping with the passage of Minnesota's Restore the Vote bill, a bipartisan legislation that restored the right to vote for more than 55,000 former incarcerated individuals. The law marked the largest expansion of voting rights since the voting age in Minnesota was lowered to 18 years old.\n\nTowns is also an executive producer and key investor in the documentary Forgiving Johnny, which details how digital transformation has aided change in the legal justice system. Furthermore, he provided funding to the film Origin and is a board member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition.\n\n\"It is a great honor to be named the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion,\" Towns said in a statement. \"I am proud to have played a role in the passing of Minnesota's Restore the Vote bill and I will always be committed to supporting social justice causes as that is part of my DNA.\"\n\nHe previously earned the NBA Cares Community Assist Award in November of 2021 with sustained community outreach efforts have been focused on youth, health and wellness and social justice.\n\nOn the court, Towns is a two-time All-NBA selection and just led the Wolves to their first playoff series victory since 2014 with a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Suns -- the first sweep in franchise history.

It felt only right to fight for everyone else to have that same right.\"\n\nThe Wolves return to Target Center for game three of the Western Conference semifinals -- their first at home this round. They lead the Denver Nuggets 2-0 in the series. In the playoffs, Towns is averaging 20.7 points and 9 rebounds a game. He's shooting 57% from the field and 54% from three.\n\n\"I just think that the unity that we're playing with,\" Towns said. \"I think we're playing very humble basketball as well and we're playing very determined basketball.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Supreme Court is currently reviewing a challenge to HF28 brought by the Minnesota Voters Alliance. The group argued the law violates a clause in the state constitution that says felons cannot vote \"unless restored to civil rights,\" contending the language means all their civil rights, not just some.

Rudy Gobert won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year this week, Naz Reid won Sixth Man of the Year last week, and Mike Conley was not far behind with his second Teammate of the Year award.\n\nThe joy in this comes from the fact that the Wolves are winning awards on and off the court. There's a greatness in play and personality that spreads throughout the entirety of the roster that few other teams can claim. That is something truly unprecedented that is worth being proud of as fans.\n\nThese are not just excellent players, but also good people filled with strong moral character.\n\nIndividually, Towns has done a remarkable amount of vital work in the field of prison reform, notably helping to sponsor House File 28, a piece of bi-partisan legislation that returned the right to vote to mass amounts of incarcerated citizens in Minnesota. Additionally, KAT worked with the non-profit organization All Square, which sponsors rehabilitation of people recently released from prison.\n\n\"It is a great honor to be named the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion,\" Towns said in a press release issued by the team. \"I am proud to have played a role in the passing of Minnesota's Restore the Vote bill and I will always be committed to supporting social justice causes as that is part of my DNA.\"\n\nMuch like Minnesota Lynx great Maya Moore, Towns' activism in pursuit of restructuring and refocusing the penal system should be lauded.\n\nBeyond this work, Towns has also used his personal investments to support change in the judicial and educational systems. He funded two visual projects this past year: \"Forgiving Johnny,\" a documentary about legal reform focusing on a public defender and her father's struggle through gridlock in law, and \"Origin,\" a film about the necessity to engage with banned materials, especially banned books.\n\nThis is an award named after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is arguably not only the greatest activist in the history of basketball, but in the history of sports. Known most for his fight against systemic racism, Abdul-Jabbar is still active in his work to maintain the history oft threatened with erasure. He has created films about the Harlem Globetrotters, Harlem Rens, and other singular figures in basketball history, such as Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd, and Nat Clifton.\n\nTowns continues to live up to the standards set almost 40 years ago as an active and praise-worthy proponent of amplifying under-represented voices and protecting those who fall in between the cracks.", "source": {"uri":

He will be presented the award prior to the third game of the Western Conference semifinals on Friday against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe award is in its fourth year. All 30 NBA teams nominate one player from their roster to be the winner. Finalists and the winner are selected by a committee composed of NBA legends, league executives and social justice leaders. A $100,000 contribution is made on the winner's behalf by the NBA to an organization of his selection. Towns chose his donation to go to the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities to advance health equity.\n\nTowns joins Carmelo Anthony (2021), Reggie Bullock (2022) and Stephen Curry (2023) as the winners of the award.\n\nOther finalists in 2023-24 included another UK star in Bam Adebayo. He will receive $25,000 for an organization on his behalf for being a finalist.\n\nTowns' honor in 2023-24 has been sparked by serving as an advocate of voting rights. He played a major role in helping with the passage of Minnesota's Restore the Vote bill, a bipartisan legislation that restored the right to vote for more than 55,000 former incarcerated individuals. Towns is also an executive producer and key investor in the documentary Forgiving Johnny, which details how digital transformation has aided change in the legal justice system. Furthermore, he provided funding to the film Origin and is a board member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition.\n\nThe Piscataway, New Jersey, native has been a mainstay in the community since entering the NBA as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015. In November of 2021, he was awarded the month-long NBA Cares Community Assist Award. Towns' sustained community outreach efforts have been focused on youth, health and wellness and social justice.\n\nIn May of 2021, Towns participated in \"A Conversation on Policing Reform\" hosted by the NBSJC with other members of the NBA family and lawmakers to discuss police reform.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Jackie, to COVID-19 early in the pandemic, Towns focused on supporting issues related to the virus, including providing donations to the Mayo Clinic to assist with testing capabilities and availability. He continues to support vaccine education and awareness.\n\nTowns also has a foundation, KAT Team. Its mission is to create a scholarship fund for young adults throughout the United States to increase literacy in underserved communities. KAT Team partners with the United Negro College Fund, which is the largest and most effective minority education organization in the country.\n\nHe has also partnered with the House of Charity Food Center in Minneapolis, The Salvation Army and HopeKids throughout his professional career.\n\nTowns is a four-time NBA All-Star and was the 2015-16 NBA Rookie of the Year. He is also a two-time All-NBA selection and is in his ninth year with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Towns and the Wolves captured their first NBA playoff series victory since 2014 with a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Suns and are 2-0 against the defending champion Denver Nuggets. Minnesota's win over Phoenix marked its first playoff series sweep in franchise history.\n\nIn six playoff games in 2024, Towns is logging 20.7 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, while shooting 57.1% from the field and 53.8% from 3-point range.\n\nHe was one of the centerpieces of the historic Kentucky 2014-15 team that flirted with a perfect season. Towns was an NCAA Consensus Second Team All-American and Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year. Towns averaged 13.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He was a three-time SEC Freshman of the Week selection and registered the most 15-plus point games with eight that season.\n\nSelected for his fourth NBA All-Star appearance in 2023-24, Towns averaged 21.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game for the Wolves who capped the season 56-26 overall and finished third in the rugged Western Conference. It was the most victories in the franchise's history since winning 58 games in 2003-04.\n\nKentucky men's basketball alumni continue to make a major impact on the NBA scene. UK led the country for the 12th straight season with 26 former student-athletes on NBA opening day rosters in 2023-24, while also pacing the nation with 22 representatives in the NBA Playoffs. At the 2024 NBA All-Star game, the Wildcats made history with a record-breaking seven players earning All-Star nods, breaking the previous high mark of four.\n\nFor the latest on the Kentucky men's

The Minnesota Timberwolves have certainly received trade inquiries, especially after the first year of the Towns-Rudy Gobert experiment resulted in stilted offense and a disappointing first-round loss.\n\nSome of the offers were decent, sources said. Others were of the ambulance-chasing variety; Minnesota is facing a massive financial crunch starting next season, and dealing Towns as he approaches the start of a four-year, $220 million-plus extension was one plausible escape route.\n\nEvery trade of the magnitude of Minnesota's 2022 deal for Gobert encompasses wagers on and against every part of the roster. It was foremost a bet on Gobert's defense, and then on Anthony Edwards -- then just approaching his 21st birthday -- developing into an alpha scorer-playmaker before Gobert, now almost 32, exited his prime.\n\nIn some ways, it was a bet against Towns -- a vote of no confidence in his defense and rim protection as a center. The conundrum of Towns was that his offense sang loudest at that position. He may well be, as he claims, the greatest shooting big man ever; his ability to drag opposing centers away from the paint unlocked Minnesota's offense. He is polished enough in the post to punish switches. But what did it matter if the Wolves could never cobble a good enough defense?\n\nAcquiring Gobert would shift Towns to power forward. Would his shooting be less valuable there? He'd no longer be yanking opposing rim-protectors outside; those guys would be guarding Gobert. He would no longer be the No. 1 option on offense either; Edwards was coming for that, and the Wolves added Mike Conley to share the ballhandling load.\n\nTowns would now be chased around the arc by faster defenders. He might be able to bully some of those guys on the block, but Gobert would crowd those spaces too. Towns might have issues guarding those quicker forwards.\n\nWhat was Towns in an Edwards-Gobert universe -- and could the Wolves find some facsimile of that at a cheaper salary? Maybe they already had that player in Naz Reid, now in the first year of a three-year, $42 million extension. Reid hit 41% on 3s this season and won Sixth Man of the Year. The Wolves went 12-6 with Reid in Towns' starting spot as Towns recovered from knee surgery.\n\nTowns' postseason record before the Gobert trade did not inspire confidence. He had scored 11 or fewer points in four of his 12 postseason games -- including Minnesota's much-celebrated play-in win in 2022. In Minnesota's subsequent six-game first-round loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, Towns compiled 27 turnovers and 25 fouls -- and just 13 assists. Under pressure, his game oscillated between two poles: overwhelmed passivity and haywire chaos.\n\nIn his first two playoff games alongside Gobert last season, Towns combined for 21 points on 8-of-27 shooting -- plus nine more ugly turnovers and seven fouls. He popped in Game 3, scoring 27 points, but the Wolves fell down 3-0 against the Denver Nuggets. The tension evaporated.\n\nBut as the pressure eased, Towns grew more composed. He stacked strong performances in Games 4 and 5, combining for 43 points on 14-of-26 shooting and 22 rebounds -- reducing his turnovers to a manageable five in 75 minutes. He fouled out of both games, but it felt like progress.\n\nThe further you advance in the playoffs, the more every small layer of extra talent matters. Well below Towns' level, some role players get played off the floor while others who appear to fit the same generic template survive and adapt. Towns is indeed in a slightly reduced role on offense next to Edwards, but he's bigger and more talented than anyone else in that role -- with the ability to expand his scoring in a pinch.\n\nSome stretchy bigs are good shooters with average shot release speeds. Towns is an all-time great shooter, always sniffing the hallowed 50/40/90 club. He has a turbo quick-flick release. At 7 feet tall, he can shoot over almost anyone. He can launch on the move.\n\nThis is one of Minnesota's pet plays from its Game 1 win in Denver last week:\n\nThe Nuggets switch the first pick, with Jamal Murray toggling onto Towns and then tracking him around Gobert's flare screen. Towns catches with nine on the shot clock. The Wolves don't have much going. He just turns and jacks from a standstill. He doesn't even register Murray in his airspace.\n\nTowns is often in a spot-up role around the Edwards-Gobert pick-and-roll. He is a four-time All-Star and has made two All-NBA teams. He's 28 -- in his prime. A lot of guys in his situation would conceive of a part-time spot-up role as beneath them. Surely, there are times Towns hungers to do a little more.\n\nBut it matters that the player in this spot is a 7-foot 40% 3-point shooter with elite ball skills-- and not, say, some average 3-and-D guy:\n\nThat is Denver's base pick-and-roll defense against most elite ball handlers: Nikola Jokic corralling Edwards at the point of the screen, almost trapping him, and the other Nuggets flying around in rotation below him. Jokic's teammates could stay closer to Minnesota's shooters if Jokic dropped back, but doing so concedes a long runway; Edwards can often rampage over and through Jokic in that scheme.\n\nOn the broadcast, TNT's Reggie Miller suggested the Nuggets stick to Minnesota's shooters and force Gobert to make a play in space. They'd love to test Gobert -- to see whether he can navigate through some traffic. There needs to be traffic, though. That's why Murray is where he is:\n\nMurray has ditched Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the right corner to block Gobert's path. That leaves Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- guarding Towns -- to split the difference between Alexander-Walker and Towns, ready to close out on whoever might get the ball.\n\nTowns is the better shooter. Caldwell-Pope would love to return to him sooner. But Murray can't abandon Gobert until Jokic recovers, and Caldwell-Pope can't jet back to Towns until Murray begins his rotation back outside. Towns needs almost no time to catch and shoot. If the defense isn't perfect, it's easy money.\n\nTowns is shooting 57% through six playoff games, including 54% on 3s. He has accepted a secondary role while still understanding he has the talent to stretch the boundaries of what a secondary role really is. This possession from Minnesota's shocking Game 2 rout in Denver felt like validation of this entire team experiment -- all the pieces clicking into place:\n\nTowns again gets the Murray switch. In the past, he might have bulldozed to the post, arms flailing and legs rickety, risking an offensive foul. Here, he clears to the corner. Kyle Anderson spots the mismatch and points for Towns to screen for Edwards:\n\nTowns demurs -- and points back at Anderson, urging him to set the screen so the Wolves can go at Jokic:\n\nIf you want to know what sacrificing to win looks like -- it looks like that: Towns getting out of the way and telling someone else to cook.\n\nEdwards whips the ball to Towns in the corner. Instead of rushing a 3, Towns dusts Murray with a pump fake, drives baseline, and rises for a layup around Jokic. The average stretch-4 can't do all of that.\n\nNo limbs extend at weird angles. There are no collisions. No one falls over. Towns is leveraging his size and the breadth of his skill set with a new calm. There are still awkward moments. Towns is averaging 4.3 fouls in the playoffs -- almost identical to his rate in 2022 and 2023. Only Towns could commit a silly foul on the opening jump ball of a mega-series -- as he did in Game 1 against Denver. Towns smashing through Murray -- twice in a row -- started the cascade that led to Nuggets coach Michael Malone erupting at officials in Game 2.\n\nBut Towns has coughed up just 10 turnovers in the playoffs -- 1.7 per game. He gagged 3.6 last postseason and a ghastly 4.5 against Memphis in 2022. The wild hook passes to no one are gone, the bumbling drives cut to a minimum.\n\nTowns is taking an extra beat to settle his feet, map the floor, and make sure he picks the right plan of attack. Edwards too is playing with a new refined self-assurance, making the simple reads when defenses load to him instead of forcing it. The Wolves, 17th in offensive efficiency in the regular season, are No. 1 in the playoffs. Anything near top-five-level is good enough for them to win the title with their ultra-stingy defense.\n\nThis huge fourth-quarter basket from Minnesota's sweep-clinching win against the Phoenix Suns stood out because of how different it looked from so many of Towns' precarious drives from previous playoff runs:\n\nTowns could moonwalk into a hurried 3, but he pauses to reassess. Eric Gordon lunges past him, ending up on Towns' right shoulder. There is an alley to Towns' left. He takes it. Josh Okogie sets up to absorb a charge. Towns slows down, eludes Okogie with one big step, and banks in a runner. That is poised.\n\nTowns is shooting 57% from floater range in the playoffs -- a monster number. That is hard to sustain, but Towns is helping himself by staying controlled and steady.\n\nThe next level is improvising when the floor is scrambled:\n\nThe Nuggets nail the first part of that defensive possession. They freeze Gobert with the ball in his hands. The Wolves are a half-second from resetting their offense from scratch. But Towns catches Caldwell-Pope ball-watching and seizes a chance to cut to the foul line for a handoff. One second, Towns is standing still and holding out his hands for the ball -- a classic spot-up guy pose. A beat later, he's a 7-footer grabbing the ball in space, bouncing it once, and side-stepping the three-time MVP for a runner: role player morphing back into a superstar.\n\nYou don't make that kind of cut unless you are fully engaged -- bought into your role, on high alert, brain whirring with one governing thought: How can I help my team now?\n\nThat has translated to defense. It will never be Towns' strong suit, but he's grinding. He managed well enough against Kevin Durant in the first round that the Wolves did not have to resort to any matchup contortionism to make do. Durant was too fast and agile for Towns in some situations, but Towns can make up for a lot of that with sheer size and effort.\n\nA lot of the Wolves' greatness on defense comes down to them being huge. With Gobert, they are gigantic -- oversized at every position save point guard with Conley on the floor. When Alexander-Walker replaces Conley, they are almost preposterously big.\n\nEven without Gobert in Game 2, the Wolves started Jaden McDaniels, Edwards, Reid, and Towns. Positional size is the great safety net on defense. It is a constant, living antidote to mistakes and blips of confusion. There are arms everywhere. Passing lanes that exist against 29 other teams are cluttered against Minnesota. The openings ball handlers are used to seeing in the same repetitive situations -- turning the corner up top, catching off a pindown on the sideline -- aren't there. You look up, and there are no good choices -- just a blur of arms and hands and sneering faces.\n\nTowns is part of that now. He's hyperattentive. Sometimes, it comes through in the simple things -- a basic big-to-big rotation, with Reid and Towns swapping assignments on the fly in Game 2 to snuff the Murray-Jokic two-man game:\n\nSometimes it's an urgent snap read -- Towns, head on a swivel, sensing a crisis and leaving a non-shooter to douse it:\n\nSome players go their whole careers without finding the right role on the right team. Sometimes, it's bad luck and bad decisions from management. Sometimes, players fight against any shift outside their comfort zone.\n\nAnd sometimes, magic happens. Circumstances align to put the right players in the right place at the right time in their careers. Towns is staring at a classic example in Aaron Gordon -- from out of place would-be ballhandling star with the Orlando Magic to apex role player in Denver.\n\nA version of that transformation might be happening for Towns -- and just in time, given the stakes of this season for Minnesota and the looming cap issues. Instead of being the odd man out -- the star Minnesota has to trade to reorient its finances and recoup picks -- maybe Towns is the bridge player snug between Edwards and Gobert in age range.\n\nThere is a long way to go. The pressure increases with each round. Towns is still fouling himself to the bench too often. But something new is happening with him on the postseason stage, and it's the kind of thing that tends to happen to very good players on teams that advance to where they've never been before.",

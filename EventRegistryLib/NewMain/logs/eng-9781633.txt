Israel has not taken responsibility for Haniyeh's death but Iran issued a threat on Wednesday to avenge his killing.\n\nBin Laden of Gaza Killed\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military wing, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the main planners of the October 7 attack that killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and ignited the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to be still in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in Tuesday's strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political chief. Hamas has said that Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and has not yet commented on the military's recent confirmation.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant described the strike that killed Mr. Deif as a \"significant milestone\" in achieving the war's objectives.\n\n\"The results of this operation reflect that Hamas is an organization in disintegration,\" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe head of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, Deif had been one of Israel's most wanted men for nearly three decades and has been on the US list of 'international terrorists' since 2015.\n\nIsrael had reportedly attempted to kill him at least eight times, including in 2001, 2002, 2006, 2014, and May 2021.\n\nThese attempts resulted in Deif losing both legs and an arm, and his wife and two children were killed.\n\nKilled at Last\n\nAmid the ongoing war in Gaza, Israel targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of Khan Younis, though his death was not immediately confirmed. According to Gaza health officials, over 90 people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike.\n\nThe house where Deif was believed to be staying was struck with a 2,000-pound (900 kg) bomb, creating a massive crater.\n\nDeif was a co-founder of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s and led the unit for decades.\n\nUnder his leadership, it conducted numerous suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and in cafes, and amassed a powerful arsenal of rockets capable of striking deep into Israel. He remained an enigmatic, underground figure in Gaza.\n\nHe never appeared in public, was seldom photographed, and his voice was rarely heard in audio statements.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

July strike, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza claimed that it killed more than 90 people, though Hamas denied that Deif was among those killed.\n\nThe strike, involving a 2,000-pound (900 kg) bomb, near the house where Deif was believed to be hiding with one of his deputies, left a massive crater.\n\nDeif was the head of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and had been among one of Israel's most wanted men for nearly three decades and listed as an \"international terrorist\" by the US since 2015.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, Deif had orchestrated numerous attacks against Israel over the years.\n\nThe military stated that Deif operated alongside Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\"During the war, he commanded Hamas's terrorist activity in the Gaza Strip by issuing commands and instructions to senior members of Hamas's military wing,\" it added.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors":

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas\u00b4 top political leader.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas\u00b4 military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has not confirmed or denied it was behind Tuesday\u00b4s strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u00b4 political chief. Hamas has said Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and did not immediately comment on the military\u00b4s announcement of confirmation.\n\nThe killing of two of Hamas\u00b4 most senior figures brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has said that he will not end the campaign in Gaza until Israel destroys Hamas\u00b4 military capabilities.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the strike that killed Deif was a \"significant milestone\" toward achieving the goals of the war. \"The results of this operation reflect that Hamas is an organization in disintegration,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe assassinations risk pushing Hamas to harden its position in negotiations for a cease-fire - or to drop out completely. And Iran has vowed vengeance for the strike on its soil, raising fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nPalestinians search for bodies and survivors in a site hit by an Israeli bombardment on Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 13, 2024.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, File)\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nDeif was one of the founders of Hamas\u00b4 military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s and led the unit for decades. Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe remained a mysterious, underground figure in Gaza.

Israel has not commented on that report.\n\n\"Mohammed Deif, the Osama bin Laden of Gaza was eliminated\" on July 13, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.\n\nThis is a \"significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas\" in Gaza, Gallant added.\n\nThe army said fighter jets had struck Khan Yunis on July 13 and \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike\".\n\nHe was killed along with one of his top commanders, Rafa Salama, the military said.\n\nHealth authorities in Hamas-run Gaza said more than 90 people had been killed in that strike but Hamas has denied Deif was among them.\n\n\"Deif initiated, planned, and executed the October 7th massacre,\" the military said.\n\nOn that day the militant Islamist group attacked southern Israel, resulting in the death of 1,197 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nDeif became head of Hamas's armed wing, Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, in 2002.\n\nHe was among Israel's most wanted man for nearly three decades and on a US list of \"international terrorists\" since 2015.\n\n\"During the war, he commanded Hamas's terrorist activity in the Gaza Strip by issuing commands and instructions to senior members of Hamas's military wing,\" the military said.\n\nDeif, whose real name is Mohammed Diab al-Masri, was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1965.\n\nThe word Deif means \"visitor\" or \"guest\" and some say he chose it because he was always on the move with Israeli hunters on his trail, never spending more than one night in the same place.\n\n'Cat with nine lives'\n\nIn videos, Deif has appeared masked or shown in a silhouette, while rare photographs have circulated of one of Israel's most wanted men.\n\nIn January, Israel released a picture of Deif showing him with one eye missing, without specifying when it was taken.\n\nHis enemies dubbed him the \"cat with nine lives\" because of his many close calls with death.\n\nIn 2014, Israel launched an air strike on Gaza, killing Deif's wife and a seven-month-old son.\n\nIt was Deif who announced the start of the Hamas attack -- operation \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" -- in an audio message on October 7.\n\nDeif became involved in Hamas in the 1980s when he was a student at the Gaza Islamic University.\n\nHe is said to have played a key role in the huge network of tunnels built beneath Gaza.\n\nHe was detained by Israel since the 1980s and spent about two years in a prison run by the Palestinian Authority. He was released or escaped, reports said.\n\nIn May, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court requested a warrant for his arrest -- alongside with Yahya Sinwar, the chief of Hamas in Gaza who is still being hunted by Israel -- for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nHamas political leader Haniyeh, who was killed Wednesday in the Iranian capital, was also on that list.\n\nThe prosecutor has also sought warrants for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Gallant.\n\nDuring the October 7 attack, militants also seized 251 people, 111 are still captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military campaign since then has killed 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the territory, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "theborneopost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Borneo Post Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tuesday's strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political chief.\n\nHamas has claimed Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and did not immediately comment on the military's

Deif was the mastermind of October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.\n\nDeif had previously survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, with the most recent being in 2021. Following the October 7 attack, he was believed to have been directing military operations from Gaza's tunnels and backstreets alongside senior colleagues.\n\nThis announcement comes a day after the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran by Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hamas.\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli army (IDF) said, \"The IDF (Israeli army) announces that on July 13th, 2024, IDF fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Yunis, and following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nHere's the video of the July strike:\n\nThe military also accused Deif of initiating, planning, and executing the October 7th massacre, a Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the death of 1,197 people, according to official Israeli figures.\n\nAt the time of the July 13 strike, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza reported that more than 90 people were killed, but Hamas denied that Deif was among them. The suspected 2,000-pound bomb (900 kilogrammes) around the house where Deif was said to have taken refuge with one of his deputies had left a giant crater.\n\nDeif, the head of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, had been one of Israel's most wanted men for nearly three decades and on a US list of \"international terrorists\" since 2015. The military stated that Deif had carried out several attacks against Israel over the years and operated alongside Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\"During the war, he commanded Hamas's terrorist activity in the Gaza Strip by issuing commands and instructions to senior members of Hamas's military wing,\" the statement added.\n\nDuring the Hamas attack, militants also seized 251 people, of which 111 are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. Since then, Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 39,480 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas' top political leader.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has not confirmed or denied it was behind Tuesday's strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political chief. Hamas has said Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and did not immediately comment on the military's announcement of confirmation.\n\nThe killing of two of Hamas' most senior figures brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has said that he will not end the campaign in Gaza until Israel destroys Hamas' military capabilities.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the strike that killed Deif was a \"significant milestone\" toward achieving the goals of the war. \"The results of this operation reflect that Hamas is an organization in disintegration,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe assassinations risk pushing Hamas to harden its position in negotiations for a cease-fire - or to drop out completely. And Iran has vowed vengeance for the strike on its soil, raising fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nDeif was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s and led the unit for decades. Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe remained a mysterious, underground figure in Gaza.

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas' top political leader.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has not confirmed or denied it was behind Tuesday's strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political chief. Hamas has said Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and did not immediately comment on the military's announcement of confirmation.\n\nDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\nThe killing of two of Hamas' most senior figures brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has said that he will not end the campaign in Gaza until Israel destroys Hamas' military capabilities.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the strike that killed Deif was a \"significant milestone\" toward achieving the goals of the war. \"The results of this operation reflect that Hamas is an organization in disintegration,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe assassinations risk pushing Hamas to harden its position in negotiations for a cease-fire - or to drop out completely. And Iran has vowed vengeance for the strike on its soil, raising fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80 per cent of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nDeif was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s and led the unit for decades.

(Image: AP)\n\nTrying to avenge a deadly bus suicide attack in Tel Aviv, Israelis launched a hunt for a specific target. The target, one of Israel's most-wanted men, was in the crosshairs. Israeli helicopter gunships launched missiles at a car in Gaza City in 2009.\n\nThe incident in broad daylight in the Sheik Radwan neighbourhood killed six.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be a missed opportunity for the Israelis.\n\nFor Deif, whose nom de guerre means \"the Guest\", is inspired from the practice of Palestinian fighters staying overnight with different sympathisers to evade Israeli intelligence. Deif rarely stayed at a place for more than a night.\n\nIsraeli forces have been on the hunt for Deif for decades. They have got him now.\n\nAfter days of suspense, Israel confirmed on Thursday that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, who is believed to have masterminded the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, was killed in an airstrike last month in Gaza.\n\nA massive strike on July 13, in which Israel claimed to target Hamas' shadowy military commander in Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least 90 people.\n\nWhat might have felt like a 'same old story' as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then said \"there still isn't absolute certainty\" that Mohammed Deif was among the dead.\n\n\"We can now confirm: Mohammed Deif was eliminated,\" the Israel Defence Forces announced on X, days after Isamil Haniyeh, who led Hamas's political operations, was killed in Tehran.\n\nMohammed Deif, the elusive commander of Hamas' military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who had been a thorn in Israel's side for decades, has been eliminated in the eighth attempt.\n\nBorn in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, Deif is credited with developing Hamas' rocket arsenal and the tunnel system, the 700-kilometre elaborate Gaza Metro.\n\nThe Israeli desperation to get undoubtedly stems from the fact that Mohammed Deif is believed to be the mastermind behind the brutal October 7 massacre in Southern Israel, which it called its '9/11 moment'.\n\nAs Hamas launched a barrage of rockets, Deif, in an audio tape broadcast, named it the \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", hinting at a payback for Israeli raids on Islam's third-holiest site (Al-Aqsa Mosque) in Jerusalem in 2021.\n\nThe 58-year-old Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, said the Reuters report.\n\nHe was also believed to have trained the militants, especially the elite Nukhba forces, who attacked on October 7, according to a report in The Guardian.\n\nThe surprise attack that left 1,200 Israelis dead and over 250 taken hostages by Hamas, is the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history,\n\nIn response, amongst the three Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill, was Deif, along with Hamas' leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Marwan, Issa his deputy, according to Reuters.\n\nDeif, who had allegedly lost his brother, nephew, niece, wife, 3-year-old daughter, and 7-month-old son in the Israeli hunt for him, is said to have survived seven assassination attempts before he was killed in the airstrike on July 13.\n\nAn Israeli air strike roughly 21 years ago, reportedly left him in a wheelchair, when the mastermind lost an arm and a leg, reported the Financial Times.\n\nIn May 2021, the Israeli military made two attempts in one week to kill Deif, but both went in vain.\n\nDespite the close calls, Deif had managed to maintain a low profile, rarely making public appearances. Until last year, only three photos of Dief were seen: one from his 20s, a masked photo, an image of his shadow used during the 7 October broadcast, and one found by Israel in millions of computer files it seized, according to The Guardian.\n\nDeif, who rose through the ranks in Hamas, was arrested by Israel in 1989, and spent 16 months in detention. In the following decade, he made sure Israel and Palestine didn't talk peace.\n\nDief, who studied chemistry at the Islamic University of Gaza, was trained by \"Engineer\" Yahya Abd-al-Latif Ayyash, the chief bombmaker of Hamas in the 1990s.\n\nIn the meantime, he helped establish the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, and later came to head it.\n\nDeif also established the 'Shadow Unit' within the al-Qassam Brigades, an elite unit meant to guard and hide enemy captives.\n\nThe July 13 strike, which targeted Deif in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, had raised questions about his fate. While Israel had refrained from officially declaring that Deif was dead, Hamas officials had claimed that he was alive and \"fine\" after the attack.\n\nHowever, while there were uncertainties about his life, the IDF's confirmation certainly brought closure to the decades-old chase and hunt of 'the guest'.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"},

He had topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's past attempts to kill him. His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.\n\nHe and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the October 7 raid, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nAfter the attack, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill the three, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.\n\nIn an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on October 7, Deif named the raid \"Al-Aqsa Flood,\" signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nA source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam's third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n\"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said. \"All this fuelled and ignited the anger.\"\n\nAt the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.\n\nThe storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAl-Aqsa rage\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on October 7.\n\nDeif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public. So when Hamas' TV channel announced he was about to speak that day, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nFor Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel's destruction.\n\nFor Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.\n\nThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the October 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas's armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.\n\nAn Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.\n\nDeception effort\n\nThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel's foe Iran, was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where it took power in 2007.\n\nBut while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land. The group had now decided to \"put an end to all this\", he said.\n\nMore than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign since October 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other, though they faced different charges.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nDeif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university's entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.", "source":

The news, if true, would mark another major victory in Israel's campaign in Gaza following Haniyeh's death.\n\nThe suspected assassination by Israel of Hamas' Haniyeh in Iran on Wednesday and Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's most senior military commander, in Beirut a few hours earlier signals a further shift in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is determined to shift the war's rules of engagement despite ongoing ceasefire talks. The deaths of two high-profile Hamas leaders would amount to Israel's biggest blows to Iran and its allies, particularly Hamas.\n\nHours after Haniyeh's death created shockwaves across the world, Netanyahu said Israel has delivered crushing blows to Iran's proxies in the Middle East and threatened to \"exact a heavy price\" against all forms of aggression. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its role in Haniyeh's assassination, which is its routine practice, although several ministers welcomed his killing. It is also a brief reprieve for Netanyahu, who has been under months of pressure from abroad and at home.\n\nIsrael carried out an airstrike on July 13 (Saturday) intended for Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, which killed over 90 people in southern Gaza. At that time, a security official said it was unclear whether Deif was killed after reports that he was hiding in a building in an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone near Khan Younis.\n\nDeif is believed to be the chief mastermind behind the Hamas-led October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. He has been on the top of Israel's most-wanted list for years and is believed to have escaped multiple Israeli assassination attempts in the past.\n\nHowever, a senior Hamas official rebuffed the Israeli allegations of Deif hiding in the tunnel as \"nonsense\" and said the strike showed that Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal. \"All the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence,\" said Abu Zurhi.\n\nMohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas' military wing, launched what he called 'Operation Al-Aqsa Storm' against Israel on October 7, 2023. \"We've decided to say enough is enough. We announce the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, and we announce that the first strike, which targeted enemy positions, airports, and military fortifications, exceeded 5,000 missiles and shells,\" said the Hamas leader in a rare statement on Saturday.\n\nDeif, a Palestinian militant, became the leader of the Hamas military wing in 2002. He was born Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri in 1965 at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, then occupied by Egypt and was raised by a poverty-stricken family. According to some reports, some of his family members occasionally participated in raids by armed Palestinians.\n\nDeif has been held responsible for a wave of suicide bombing attacks that killed numerous Israeli soldiers and civilians since the first intifada. In 1996, around 50 Israelis were killed in bus bombings orchestrated by Deif and Ayyash, after which he was arrested and released in 2001. After his release, Deif orchestrated a series of deadly bombing attacks during the second intifada that again killed many Israelis.\n\nAs his status became more prominent, Israel's military and intelligence external spy agency Mossad tried to assassinate him several times, but failed. Israel's security services tried to kill him at least five times before 2021. During the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) again tried to kill him twice in vain. The first assassination attempt came in 2001, and in the next year, Deif lost an eye in an Israeli airstrike. In 2006, Israel conducted another airstrike in which Deif lost both his legs and an arm. He was rendered partially paralysed.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli announcement.\n\nDeif had survived seven previous Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021. In the months since Oct. 7, he was believed to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.\n\nRising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He had topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's past attempts to kill him. His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.\n\nHe and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, in which 1,139 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nAfter the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill the three - Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.\n\nFrom L to R Marwan Issa, Mohammad Deif and Yahya Sinwar\n\nIn an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nA source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam's third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n\"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said. \"All this fuelled and ignited the anger.\"\n\nAt the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.\n\nThe storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAL-AQSA RAGE\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on Oct. 7.\n\nDeif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public. So when Hamas' TV channel announced he was about to speak that day, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nFor Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel's destruction.\n\nFor Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.\n\nThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the Oct. 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas's armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.\n\nAn Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.\n\nDECEPTION EFFORT\n\nThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel's foe Iran, was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where it took power in 2007.\n\nBut while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land. The group had now decided to \"put an end to all this\", he said.\n\nMore than 39,450 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign since Oct. 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defense chief over Israel's response.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nDeif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university's entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.", "source":

At the time, there had been no immediate confirmation that Deif was killed. The strike had also displaced civilians in nearby tents.\n\n'Following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike,\" the Israeli military said on Thursday.\n\nThis comes a day after a senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran. While Hamas accused Israel of the killing and called it a \"severe escalation\" amid the ongoing conflict, Iran's supreme leader vowed revenge against Israel. \"We consider his revenge as our duty,\" Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement on his official website.

Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli announcement.\n\nDeif had survived seven previous Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021. In the months since Oct. 7, he was believed to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.\n\nRising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He had topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's past attempts to kill him. His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.\n\nHe and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nAfter the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill the three - Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.\n\nIn an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nA source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam's third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n\"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said. \"All this fuelled and ignited the anger.\"\n\nAt the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.\n\nThe storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAL-AQSA RAGE\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on Oct. 7.\n\nDeif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public. So when Hamas' TV channel announced he was about to speak that day, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nFor Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel's destruction.\n\nFor Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.\n\nThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the Oct. 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas's armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.\n\nAn Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.\n\nDECEPTION EFFORT\n\nThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel's foe Iran, was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where it took power in 2007.\n\nBut while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land. The group had now decided to \"put an end to all this\", he said.\n\nMore than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign since Oct. 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nDeif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university's entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.\n\n(Editing by

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas' top political leader.\n\nThe rapid events this week have left U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators scrambling to salvage talks for a cease-fire deal in Gaza. At the same time, international diplomats were trying to avert an escalation into all-out regional war after the assassination in Tehran of Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh, Israel's killing of a top Hezbollah commander in a Beirut strike and - now - Israel's announcement of Deif's death.\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the Israeli claim by Hamas, which had previously said Deif survived the July strike in Gaza. A member of Hamas' political bureau, Izzat al-Risheq, said in a statement Thursday that confirming or denying his death is the responsibility of the armed wing, known as the Izzedin al-Qassam Brigades, which so far was silent.\n\nThe elimination of Haniyeh and Deif -- two of Hamas' most senior figures -- brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. It also puts him at a crossroads.\n\nIt potentially presents him with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas' military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nIt could also lead him to harden Israel's position in cease-fire talks, with Israeli officials insisting the blows to Hamas will force it to compromise. Hamas too could dig in as well in the talks -- or quit them entirely.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nSo far Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed. Far-right nationalist coalition partners, on whom he relies to stay in power, have threatened to bolt the government if he halts the war.\n\nAfter the announcement on Deif, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the \"defeat of Hamas is closer than ever.\" He said the military would continue to \"eliminate thousands of other terrorists until our security is restored and we bring the hostages home.\"", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated

Deif, 58, was considered the mastermind of the October 7 attack by Hamas, which triggered the killing of 39,445 people in Palestine including more than 15,000 children and the injuring 'of more than 91,073 people by Israel as of July 31, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile Israel claims that it has evidence of Deif's death, an official told news agency AFP that Deif is well and overseeing the operations of Hamas, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nBorn in 1965, in one of the refugee camps in Khan Younis, Deif was originally named Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri. Despite being born into a poor family in one of the few refugee camps built by Israel after 1948, Deif was able to attain a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. Deif also headed the university and performed comedies on stage.\n\nIn 1987, Deif joined Hamas when it was founded and fought in the first intifada or the Palestinian uprising which began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo Accords. In 1989, during the peak of the intifada, Deif was detained by Israel for 16 months.\n\nIn 2002, Deif took charge of the Qassam Brigades after Israel assassinated his predecessor and founding leader Salah Shehadeh. It is Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing which carried out attacks inside Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking up about 200 people captive, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Deif had survived at least seven Israeli assassination attempts and if Israel's claims are true he surrendered to death in the eighth attempt. However, Hamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's attempts to kill him, reported news agency Reuters.\n\nExperienced, capable and utterly committed to the militant Islamist organisation, Deif in the recent years was overseeing Hamas' efforts to build more effective rockets in Gaza and the immense tunnel complex across the territory and is also rumoured to have been tasked with training militants, especially the Nukhba forces which attacked Israel in 2023.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014, reported Reuters.\n\nHamas's attack on October 7 was a result of planning by the three-man military council which planned the attack as revenge for the Israeli raid of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nDeif with Hamas' leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and his deputy Marwan Issa, who was killed in March 2024, planned the attack on Israel after it raided Islam's third holiest site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nThere are only three available images of Deif. One of them is of his shadow which was broadcast on the Hamas TV channel during which he said, \"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" reported Reuters.\n\nA source close to Hamas, told Reuters that the decision to prepare the October 7 attack was jointly taken by Deif, the leader of Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, however, it was clear that Deif was the architect.\n\nIn 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor requested warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the October 7 attack. However, warrants were also issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel's response which has resulted in the ongoing genocide, reported Al

Hamas has denied that he was killed.\n\nIsrael has confirmed that Mohammed Deif, the chief of Hamas' military wing, was killed in a July airstrike in Gaza. This announcement followed weeks of investigation to verify his death. The airstrike, conducted on July 13, targeted a compound on the outskirts of Khan Younis, a southern Gaza city. During this strike, more than 90 people, including displaced civilians, lost their lives. At the time, Gaza health officials reported significant casualties, including those living in nearby tents.\n\nInitial Uncertainty and Hamas' Denial\n\nFollowing the July 13 strike, the Israeli military spent several weeks determining whether Deif was among the fatalities. Despite Israel's assessment, Hamas has consistently denied that Deif was killed in the attack. The military's confirmation came after a comprehensive intelligence assessment. According to the Israeli military, this confirmation verifies that Deif was indeed killed in the July strike through their X (formerly Twitter) page.\n\nRecent Developments and Tensions\n\nThe announcement of Deif's death coincides with another significant development. The day before, an apparent Israeli airstrike in Tehran reportedly killed Hamas' top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. While Israel has not officially confirmed or denied responsibility for this attack, Iran has vowed retaliation. Israel's operations have focused on eliminating top Hamas figures, including Yehya Sinwar, who remains elusive despite being a primary target.\n\nDeif's Role and Legacy\n\nMohammed Deif was a prominent figure within Hamas, having been a key founder of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, in the 1990s. Under his leadership, the Brigades became known for their numerous attacks against Israelis, including suicide bombings on buses and at cafes. Deif also oversaw the development of a substantial arsenal of rockets capable of striking deep into Israeli territory.

(AP)\n\nHamas' military leader Mohammed Deif, one of the masterminds of the Oct. 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel, was an elusive figure who had a long and secretive career in the Palestinian group and had been sought by Israel for decades.\n\nDeif, 58, was finally killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 13, a huge blow to the armed group more than nine months after the Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel's devastating campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Thursday it had confirmed his death in the airstrike in Gaza's Khan Younis area. Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli announcement.\n\nDeif had survived seven previous Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021. In the months since Oct. 7, he was believed to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.\n\nRising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He had topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's past attempts to kill him. His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.\n\nHe and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nAfter the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill the three - Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.\n\nIn an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", signaling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nA source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam's third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n\"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said. \"All this fueled and ignited the anger.\"\n\nAt the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.\n\nThe storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAL-AQSA RAGE\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on Oct. 7.\n\nDeif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public. So when Hamas' TV channel announced he was about to speak that day, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nFor Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel's destruction.\n\nFor Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.\n\nThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the Oct. 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas's armed wing, known as al-Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.\n\nAn Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.\n\nDECEPTION EFFORT\n\nThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel's foe Iran, was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where it took power in 2007.\n\nBut while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land. The group had now decided to \"put an end to all this\", he said.\n\nMore than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign since Oct. 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defense chief over Israel's response.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nDeif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university's entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.", "source":

Rising through the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's tunnel network and bomb-making expertise, making him one of Israel's most wanted figures.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp, Deif joined Hamas during the first Intifada, which began in 1987. He was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention. Deif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry, and biology. His wife, seven-month-old son, and three-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.\n\nHamas did not immediately respond to the Israeli announcement of Deif's death. His survival over the years had made him a folk hero among some Palestinians, despite being held responsible for numerous Israeli deaths in suicide bombings. Deif, along with Yahya Sinwar and Marwan Issa, formed a military council that planned the October 7 raid, the deadliest attack in Israel's history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,200 people and the taking of more than 250 hostages.\n\nThe attack, named \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" by Deif, was seen as retaliation for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque. A source close to Hamas stated that Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, following a raid on the mosque that outraged the Arab and Muslim world. \"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said.\n\nThe plan for the October 7 attack involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing on economic development in Gaza. However, while Israel provided economic incentives to Gazan workers, Hamas fighters were being trained and drilled. In his recording, Deif stated that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its actions against Palestinians and had decided to \"put an end to all this.\"\n\nSince October 7, more than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign, and much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble. In May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar, and another Hamas figure over the attack, as well as for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense chief over Israel's response. Both Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marwan_Issa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marwan Issa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_University_of_Gaza", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic University of Gaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ramadan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112194839,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-89158,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781633", "eventUri": "eng-9781633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 108, "textEnd": 115}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 504, "textEnd": 513, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Israel did not immediately claim responsibility for Haniyeh's death.\n\nDeif is believed to have been responsible for planning and executing the bloody October 7 incursion into Israel, in which Hamas members and their allies killed some 1,200 Israelis and took some 240 hostage.\n\nThe head of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, Deif had been among Israel's most wanted man for nearly three decades and on a US list of 'international terrorists' since 2015.\n\nIsrael had reportedly tried to kill him at least eight times - including in 2001, 2002, 2006, 2014 and in May 2021.\n\nThe attempts saw both of his legs and an arm blown off and his wife and two children killed.\n\nAmid the ongoing war in Gaza, Israel targeted Deif in a strike on July 13 that hit a compound on the outskirts of the city of Khan Younis, but there had been no immediate confirmation he was killed.\n\nMore than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nThe house where Deif was believed to have taken residence was hit with a 2,000lb (900kg) bomb, leaving a giant crater.\n\nOne of the founders of Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, the former bombmaker, who studied physics, chemistry and biology at the Islamic University in Gaza, had led the unit for decades.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention before rising through the ranks.\n\nUnder his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel.\n\nDeif operated along with Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza, the Israeli military said.\n\n'During the war, he commanded Hamas's terrorist activity in the Gaza Strip by issuing commands and instructions to senior members of Hamas's military wing,' it added.\n\nThere were rumours the sinister mastermind of the October 7 attacks had been killed earlier this month, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in mid-July it was 'still not absolutely certain' whether Deif was dead.\n\nThe announcement came a day after political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an airstrike in Tehran.\n\nHaniyeh, a multi-billionaire who had been living in exile in Qatar since 2019, was reportedly killed when an 'airborne guided projectile' hit his compound in Tehran. Israel has not claimed responsibility.\n\nAfter being appointed to the Hamas top job in 2017, Haniyeh moved between Turkey and Qatar's capital Doha, escaping the travel curbs of the blockaded Gaza Strip.\n\nThe role enabled him to act as a negotiator in ceasefire talks or to talk to Hamas' ally Iran - and as a relay between hardline figures like Yahya Sinwar (the leader of Hamas in Gaza) and the outside world.\n\nBut many living in the beleaguered Gaza Strip, including members of Hamas, became disillusioned with Haniyeh as he became removed from the lives of people on the ground.\n\n'The fact that he lived in a five-star hotel in Doha made him very unpopular with some of the Hamas figures on the ground in Gaza,' Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor of Security Studies at King's College London, told MailOnline.\n\n'He's not someone who the organisation is relying on very much. But it is clearly a very symbolic strike.'\n\nWhile Iran has vowed 'revenge' for Haniyeh's death, it is not expected his killing will lead to a dramatic escalation of the regional conflict.\n\n'What this offers is a head on a silver platter,' Dr Krieg added. 'Netanyahu can say this is the end of the organisation. And that's pretty much as close as Israel will ever get to defeating Hamas.\n\n'But that can only work if Israel says now \"we're willing to enter ceasefire talks.\"'\n\n'All sides don't want all out war. All sides want to maintain their reputation. Nobody wants to lose face. These people are replaceable.\n\n'All sides will find a way in this tit-for-tat escalation to respond in measure beyond a certain ceiling... all sides have been pushing the threshold but on all accounts they have always tried not to breach it.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Israeli military said its conclusion was based on intelligence, without offering any specific evidence.\n\nIsrael's claim comes after weeks of speculation about the fate of Mr. Deif since an Israeli airstrike on July 13 in southern Gaza targeted the secretive Hamas commander. At the time, the Israeli military did not say for certain whether Mr. Deif had been killed, and Hamas has not commented.\n\n\"Following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Muhammad Deif was eliminated in the strike,\" the Israeli military said in a statement.\n\nMr. Deif, who survived several previous Israeli assassination attempts, has been the No. 2 Hamas leader in Gaza. He is the highest-ranking commander in the armed group that Israel says it has killed in Gaza since it began its military campaign there after the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nIsrael's government made eliminating Hamas's leadership a stated goal of the war, and his death would be counted as a victory in that effort. How Hamas's operations could be affected remains to be seen: Israel has killed many senior commanders in the past, only to see the group swiftly replace them.\n\nThe announcement comes just a day after Ismail Haniyeh, the exiled leader of Hamas's political bureau, was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Both Hamas and Iran have blamed Israel, which has declined to confirm or deny its involvement.\n\nMr. Deif was de facto second in command to the group's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.\n\nBorn in 1965 to a poor Palestinian family, Mr. Deif grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp and joined Hamas as a young man, around the time the group was founded in the late 1980s.\n\nHe quickly rose through the organization's ranks, developed a reputation as a master bomb maker and orchestrated a number of attacks on Israel, including a series of deadly bus bombings that undermined the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in the mid-1990s.\n\nAnalysts credit him with transforming Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, into a powerful and well-organized fighting force with tens of thousands in its ranks.\n\nCassandra Vinograd contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_rasgon@nytimes.com", "name": "Adam Rasgon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_boxerman@nytimes.com", "name": "Aaron Boxerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/16/multimedia/00mideast-crisis-deif-HFO-deif-promo/00mideast-crisis-deif-HFO-1-hwgb-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781633", "eventUri": "eng-9781633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 226, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 508, "textEnd": 515}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Has the terror group been left weakened?\n\nYahya Sinwar\n\nSinwar, 62, is the charismatic leader of the Hamas movement within Gaza.\n\nThought to be the architect of the October 7 attack, Sinwar has been dubbed the 'butcher of Khan Younis' by the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\nAs per Britannica, Sinwar was born on October 29, 1962 in the Khan Younis refugee camp.\n\nHis parents were displaced from Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nThe Khan Younis refugee camp, home to many such families, was a cramped place where even basic necessities were unavailable.\n\nSinwar in the 1980s studied at the Islamic University of Gaza.\n\nAs per BBC, Sinwar founded the Majd - the security service of Hamas.\n\nIn 1988, Sinwar was given four life sentences in prison after being convicted for the murder of Palestinians collaborating with Israel.\n\nSinwar remained busy in prison - influencing and sometimes even coercing fellow prisoners as well as reading Israeli newspaper and becoming fluent in Hebrew.\n\nSinwar in 2011 was released from prison as part of an exchange between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe deal saw over 1,000 Palestinian and Israeli-Arab prisoners being exchanged for a single Israeli soldier who had been held in captivity for five years.\n\nUpon being released, Sinwar immediately joined the top ranks of Hamas.\n\nThe US in 2015 designated Sinwar an 'international terrorist.'\n\nIn October, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Sinwar a 'dead man walking.'\n\nNo one knows where Sinwar is, but he is thought to be hiding deep in the tunnels of Gaza.\n\nMohammed Deif\n\nMohammed Deif is the chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades - the military wing of Hamas.\n\nKnown as the 'walking ghost,' Deif has survived multiple assassination attempts from Israel including earlier in July.\n\nSome say this is because he is always trying to stay ahead of the Israeli forces.\n\nHamas on the morning of October 7 released a rare voice recording of Deif announcing the operation.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners, whom he said were abused and tortured, and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land.\n\n\"Every day the occupation storm our villages, towns and cities in the West Bank and raid houses, kill, injure, destroy and detain. At the same time, it confiscates thousands of acres of our land, uproots our people from their houses to build settlements while its criminal siege continues on Gaza.\"\n\nA source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the attack, known as the Al Aqsa Flood to Hamas, was taken jointly by Deif and Sinwar, but it was clear who was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source added.\n\nLike Yahya Sinwar, Deif was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp.\n\nBorn Mohammad Masri in 1965, he took the name Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nDeif was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nHe earned a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology.\n\nHe displayed an affinity for the arts, heading the university's entertainment committee and performing on stage in comedies.\n\nRising in Hamas ranks, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He has topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nAs per BBC, these include bus bombings tin 1996 and the capture and murder of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.\n\nDeif was imprisoned by Israel in 2000, but he escaped at the beginning of the second Palestinian Intifada.\n\nFor Deif, staying in the shadow has been a matter of life or death. Hamas sources said he lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's assassination attempts.\n\nAs per BBC, he is also thought to have trouble speaking.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed by an Israeli air strike in 2014.\n\nHis survival while running Hamas's armed wing has earned him the status of a Palestinian folk hero. In videos he is masked, or just a shadow of him is seen. He doesn't use modern digital technology such as smart phones, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nHe and his family lived in the West Bank until 1967 - until it was captured by Israel.\n\nHis family then moved to Kuwait - where his father had been working as an agricultural labourer and a preacher since the 1950s.\n\nDeeply religious as a young man, Hamas joined the Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait as a teenager.\n\nIn 1974, he enrolled at Kuwait University where he studied physics and took part in Palestinian activism.\n\nMashal remained in Kuwait after graduating where he organised and raised money to fund social services in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nIn 1987, after the first Intafada, Hamas was founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood and religious factions of the PLO.\n\nIn 1992, Hamas announced the formation of a political bureau of which Mashal, who had moved to Jordan after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, was a member.\n\nIn 1996, Mashal was elected as chief of Hamas' political bureau.\n\nIn 1997, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved Mashal's assassination in retribution for Hamas' suicide bombings.\n\nAs per BBC, Mossad agents injected Mashal with a poison while he was walking on the streets of Amman.\n\nThe plan was foiled after the two Mossad agents were captured and King Hussein of Jordan intervened.\n\nHussein managed to get the antidote for Mashal after then US president Bill Clinton pressured Netanyahu into giving it up.\n\nMashal remained the head of Hamas till 2017 when he was succeeded by Haniyeh.\n\nMashal was one of Hamas' key hostage negotiators.\n\nMashal caused controversy in India when he virtually addressed a 'solidarity event' organised by the Solidarity Youth Movement in October.\n\nZahar was born in 1945 near Gaza City. His father was Palestinian father and his mother was Egyptian.\n\nZahar studied in school in Gaza and then attended university in Cairo.\n\nHe worked as a doctor in Gaza and Khan Younis until he was fired over his political views.\n\nIn 1988, after the founding of Hamas, Israel imprisoned Zahar.\n\nZahar was ultimately deported to Lebanon in 1992.\n\nZahar survived an assassination attempt on his life after returning to Gaza.\n\nHowever, his oldest son was killed in the attack.\n\nHe lost another son, a member of Hamas' military wing, in an Israeli air strike in 2008.\n\nAccording to ECFR.eu, Zahar in 2006 was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).\n\nHe was then appointed Palestine's foreign minister.\n\nHe is thought to be among Hamas' most hawkish and socially conservative leaders.\n\nHas Hamas been left weakened?\n\nHaniyeh's death comes on the heels of Hamas having nearly half its forces wiped out since the beginning of the war.\n\nThe enclave's ruling group has been reduced to between 9,000 and 12,000 fighters, according to three senior US officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict.\n\nBy contrast, Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nThe group is now relying on hit-and-run insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, US officials have said.\n\nThey added that such tactics could sustain a Hamas insurgency for months to come, aided by weapons smuggled into Gaza via tunnels and others repurposed from unexploded ordnance or captured from Israeli forces.\n\nThis kind of protracted timeframe is echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national security adviser who said last week the war could last until the end of 2024 at least.\n\nIn a parallel propaganda drive, some of the group's fighters are videotaping their ambushes of Israeli troops, before editing and posting them on Telegram and other social media apps.\n\nPeter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told Reuters they were still some way from destroying Hamas, which he also said had lost roughly half of its fighting force.\n\nLerner said the military was adapting to the group's shift in tactics and acknowledged Israel couldn't eliminate every Hamas fighter or destroy every Hamas tunnel.\n\n\"There is never a goal to kill each and every last terrorist on the ground. That's not a realistic goal,\" he added. \"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli announcement.\n\nDeif had survived seven previous Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021. In the months since Oct. 7, he was believed to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.\n\nRising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He had topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHamas sources said Deif lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel's past attempts to kill him. His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.\n\nHe and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nAfter the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government vowed to kill the three - Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.\n\nIn an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nA source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam's third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world.\n\n\"It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,\" the source said. \"All this fuelled and ignited the anger.\"\n\nAt the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.\n\nThe storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAL-AQSA RAGE\n\nThere are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on Oct. 7.\n\nDeif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public. So when Hamas' TV channel announced he was about to speak that day, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.\n\n\"Today the rage of Al-Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,\" Deif said in the recording.\n\nFor Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel's destruction.\n\nFor Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.\n\nThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the Oct. 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas's armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.\n\n\"There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,\" the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.\n\nAn Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.\n\nDECEPTION EFFORT\n\nThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel's foe Iran, was not interested in starting a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where it took power in 2007.\n\nBut while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.\n\nSpeaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land. The group had now decided to \"put an end to all this\", he said.\n\nMore than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign since Oct. 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn May 2024, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.\n\nHe was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.\n\nDeif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university's entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.\n\nHis wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.\n\n(Editing by

He was responsible for numerous suicide bombings that killed Israeli civilians, as well as other terrorist attacks and the strengthening of Hamas in the West Bank.", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "i24NEWS English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF_Spokesperson's_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IDF Spokesperson's Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.i24news.tv/uploads/ac/69/12/9a/8d/89/06/8e/00/21/41/8e/ba/96/ad/86/ac69129a8d89068e0021418eba96ad86.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781633", "eventUri": "eng-9781633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 33, "textEnd": 40}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 704}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The official declined to specify the nature of that intelligence.\n\nA statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had conducted a \"precise, targeted strike\" on a compound where Deif and another commander Rafe Salama were staying. The IDF announced Salama's death last month.\n\nIn recent weeks Israeli officials said they had indications their strike was successful but were not able to confirm that he was killed until now.\n\nThe strike targeting Deif in Khan Younis last month hit a designated humanitarian zone, killing at least 90 Palestinians. Footage from the Al-Mawasi displacement camp showed bodies in the street and destroyed tents.\n\nAn elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks. He led the Palestinian militant group's armed wing for more than two decades.\n\nDeif is thought to have been born in the 1960s in the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of a number of such camps established in Gaza at the end of the 1940s for displaced Palestinians denied the freedom to return to their homes by the newly-created state of Israel.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as \"El Deif\" or \"the Guest\" due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel.\n\nDeif was at the top of Israel's most wanted list for decades, with Israel holding him responsible for the deaths of dozens of its citizens. Both the US and the EU had him on terror blacklists.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Deif and Hamas' political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defenses, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza. The attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil cease-fire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas' military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely won't end with Deif's alleged death. He was believed to be 58 or 59.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nDeif, like Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s. Gaza is home to several such camps whose inhabitants fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the country's establishment in 1948.\n\nHe is believed to have joined Hamas shortly after the formation of the Islamist Palestinian group in the late 1980s, at the onset of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. The group's ideology calls for armed resistance and the violent destruction of Israel.\n\nIn 1989, during the height of the uprising, Deif was arrested by Israel but later released.\n\nMichael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, is one of the few Israelis to have met Deif personally when he was a quiet, bookish 16-year-old imprisoned in a detention facility in Khan Younis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers. \"He was very, very patriotic, very involved in the intifada,\" Koubi said.\n\nHe would go on to found Hamas' network in the West Bank in 1993, the year that Israel reached an interim peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Israeli military said. That same year, he was also promoted to the head of Hamas' armed wing, it said.\n\nIsrael holds Deif responsible for plotting many attacks that killed scores of Israeli civilians, including the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldier Nahshon Wachsman in the West Bank in October 1994, and suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in 1996.\n\nThe attacks in the mid-90s are widely believed to have tipped the 1996 Israeli election in favor of Benjamin Netanyahu, who eked out a surprise victory over the more moderate front-runner Shimon Peres. Under Netanyahu's lengthy leadership and his successive nationalist governments, the prospects of an independent Palestinian state have grown dimmer, chances that have further diminished because of Hamas' attack and the war.\n\nUnder Deif's watch, Hamas developed its rocket program, beginning with rudimentary weapons capable of traveling just a few kilometers (miles) and evolving into an arsenal that struck deep inside Israel, reaching its seaside metropolis Tel Aviv and the foothills of Jerusalem. He was also in command when soldier Gilad Schalit was kidnapped into Gaza in 2006. Schalit would be released five years later in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a trade that set Sinwar free.\n\nDeif is also thought to have helped expand Hamas' labyrinth of underground tunnels in Gaza -- where he is believed to have hidden during the ongoing war.\n\nKoubi said Deif's fingerprints were all over the Oct. 7 attack, from its sweeping scope to the more surprising aspects like the paragliders who flew over the fence and landed in the border communities at the start of the attack.\n\n\"He was very creative,\" he said.\n\nThere are few photos of Deif, and he is thought to be unrecognizable to most Palestinians.\n\nDeif has been so elusive that even his appearance was a point of speculation. Some media reports say he was paralyzed and used a wheelchair for years following injuries he sustained during past assassination attempts, while others reported he was able to walk unassisted.\n\nIn 2014, Palestinian media said his wife and two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, one of the many failed attempts to kill him.\n\nMoshe Fuzaylov, a long-time investigator and former senior official for the Shin Bet, said that if Deif was killed, it could open a window of opportunity where Hamas will be in disarray, including over Haniyeh's death. It could push the group toward a cease-fire with Israel while they are in a weakened state.\n\n\"It's a morale hit and a very strong operational hit, and it changes this organization from something that has two legs to lean on to one that is limping,\" he said.\n\nBut it wouldn't necessarily be a death blow for Hamas.\n\n\"Israel has targeted Hamas political and military leaders in the past,\" said Khaled el-Gindy, an analyst specializing in Palestinian affairs with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Deif, the highest-ranking Hamas commander to be killed during Israel's 10-month-war with Hamas, was the target of July 13 strikes on southern Gaza, which the Gaza Health Ministry said killed at least 90 Palestinians in a humanitarian zone. Afterward, Israel's military said it was still working to confirm whether Deif was among the dead. \"We can now confirm: Mohammed Deif was eliminated,\" the Israel Defense Forces wrote early Thursday on X.\n\nDeif was considered one of the architects of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel. But he was on Israel's kill list long before that. He's led Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, for more than two decades. He's thought to have directed day-to-day combat operations, overseen the construction of Gaza's tunnel network, and planned the bus bombings that killed dozens of people in Jerusalem in 1996, per the Washington Post and BBC. He reportedly survived at least seven prior assassination attempts, \"including one in 2002 when he lost an eye,\" per the BBC.\n\n\"Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as 'El Deif' or 'the Guest' due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel,\" CNN reports. Hamas previously denied he was killed in the July 13 strikes. However, an Israeli military official tells CNN that new intelligence confirms he was. It's \"a significant milestone\" and \"reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating,\" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday, per the BBC. The confirmation comes a day after Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in a strike in Tehran. Both Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel, per the Post.

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas' top political leader.\n\nThe rapid events this week have left U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators scrambling to salvage talks for a cease-fire deal in Gaza. At the same time, international diplomats were trying to avert an escalation into all-out regional war after the assassination in Tehran of Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh, Israel's killing of a top Hezbollah commander in a Beirut strike and - now - Israel's announcement of Deif's death.\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the Israeli claim by Hamas, which had previously said Deif survived the July strike in Gaza. A member of Hamas' political bureau, Izzat al-Risheq, said in a statement Thursday that confirming or denying his death is the responsibility of the armed wing, known as the Izzedin al-Qassam Brigades, which so far was silent.\n\nThe elimination of Haniyeh and Deif -- two of Hamas' most senior figures -- brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. It also puts him at a crossroads.\n\nIt potentially presents him with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas' military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nIt could also lead him to harden Israel's position in cease-fire talks, with Israeli officials insisting the blows to Hamas will force it to compromise. Hamas too could dig in as well in the talks -- or quit them entirely.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nSo far Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed. Far-right nationalist coalition partners, on whom he relies to stay in power, have threatened to bolt the government if he halts the war.\n\nAfter the announcement on Deif, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the \"defeat of Hamas is closer than ever.\" He said the military would continue to \"eliminate thousands of other terrorists until our security is restored and we bring the hostages home.\"\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the strike that killed Deif was a \"significant milestone\" toward achieving the goals of the war. \"The results of this operation reflect that Hamas is an organization in disintegration,\" he wrote on X.\n\nDeif was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s. He led the unit for decades through campaigns of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians, volleys of rocket fire into Israel, and repeated past Israeli assaults on Gaza since Hamas took power there in 2007.\n\nHe remained a mysterious, underground figure in Gaza. He never appeared in public, was hardly ever photographed and only rarely was his voice heard in audio statements. He survived a string of Israeli assassination attempts.\n\nHaniyeh's killing in particular threw into disarray months of efforts at reaching a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza and a hostage release. Haniyeh had been a main negotiator in those talks.\n\nQatari and Egyptian officials had tense exchanges with U.S counterparts over the assassination, said an Egyptian official with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been pressing Egyptian and Qatari mediators to get Hamas to compromise, the Americans can't \"pressure the other party, Israel to ... refrain from provocative acts,\" the Egyptian official said, calling the assassination \"reckless.\"\n\nQatar's prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, expressed frustration in a post on social media, saying: \"Can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the U.S. had no prior knowledge of the strike in Tehran that killed Haniyeh.\n\nThe Egyptian official said no deal was likely in the near future since Hamas must now name Haniyeh's replacement. Mediators had been waiting for Hamas' response on the latest version of the deal. Instead, after Haniyeh's funeral, expected Friday, he said they will reach out to Hamas officials to explore the next steps.\n\nAfter Haniyeh's assassination, Iran has vowed revenge against Israel, and the killing of Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in Beirut could also bring reprisals -- raising fears of a wider spiral of escalation.\n\nThe Egyptian official now said the priority was preventing full-scale war.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type":

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Deif and Hamas' political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defenses, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza. The attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil cease-fire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas' military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely won't end with Deif's alleged death. He was believed to be 58 or 59.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nDeif, like Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s. Gaza is home to several such camps whose inhabitants fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the country's establishment in 1948.\n\nHe is believed to have joined Hamas shortly after the formation of the Islamist Palestinian group in the late 1980s, at the onset of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. The group's ideology calls for armed resistance and the violent destruction of Israel.\n\nIn 1989, during the height of the uprising, Deif was arrested by Israel but later released.\n\nMichael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, is one of the few Israelis to have met Deif personally when he was a quiet, bookish 16-year-old imprisoned in a detention facility in Khan Younis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers. \"He was very, very patriotic, very involved in the intifada,\" Koubi said.\n\nHe would go on to found Hamas' network in the West Bank in 1993, the year that Israel reached an interim peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Israeli military said. That same year, he was also promoted to the head of Hamas' armed wing, it said.\n\nIsrael holds Deif responsible for plotting many attacks that killed scores of Israeli civilians, including the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldier Nahshon Wachsman in the West Bank in October 1994, and suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in 1996.\n\nThe attacks in the mid-90s are widely believed to have tipped the 1996 Israeli election in favor of Benjamin Netanyahu, who eked out a surprise victory over the more moderate front-runner Shimon Peres. Under Netanyahu's lengthy leadership and his successive nationalist governments, the prospects of an independent Palestinian state have grown dimmer, chances that have further diminished because of Hamas' attack and the war.\n\nUnder Deif's watch, Hamas developed its rocket program, beginning with rudimentary weapons capable of traveling just a few kilometers (miles) and evolving into an arsenal that struck deep inside Israel, reaching its seaside metropolis Tel Aviv and the foothills of Jerusalem. He was also in command when soldier Gilad Schalit was kidnapped into Gaza in 2006. Schalit would be released five years later in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a trade that set Sinwar free.\n\nDeif is also thought to have helped expand Hamas' labyrinth of underground tunnels in Gaza -- where he is believed to have hidden during the ongoing war.\n\nKoubi said Deif's fingerprints were all over the Oct. 7 attack, from its sweeping scope to the more surprising aspects like the paragliders who flew over the fence and landed in the border communities at the start of the attack.\n\n\"He was very creative,\" he said.\n\nThere are few photos of Deif, and he is thought to be unrecognizable to most Palestinians.\n\nDeif has been so elusive that even his appearance was a point of speculation. Some media reports say he was paralyzed and used a wheelchair for years following injuries he sustained during past assassination attempts, while others reported he was able to walk unassisted.\n\nIn 2014, Palestinian media said his wife and two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, one of the many failed attempts to kill him.\n\nMoshe Fuzaylov, a long-time investigator and former senior official for the Shin Bet, said that if Deif was killed, it could open a window of opportunity where Hamas will be in disarray, including over Haniyeh's death. It could push the group toward a cease-fire with Israel while they are in a weakened state.\n\n\"It's a morale hit and a very strong operational hit, and it changes this organization from something that has two legs to lean on to one that is limping,\" he said.\n\nBut it wouldn't necessarily be a death blow for Hamas.\n\n\"Israel has targeted Hamas political and military leaders in the past,\" said Khaled el-Gindy, an analyst specializing in Palestinian affairs with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets struck a compound in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on July 13, killing Deif.\n\nThe IDF also released footage of the airstrike that it described as the \"moment of [Deif's] elimination.\"\n\nThe announcement of Deif's death comes the day after Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, was killed in an airstrike in Iran. Israel has not yet confirmed or denied responsibility for that attack in Tehran. It did, however, claim a separate airstrike in Beirut hours earlier that killed another of its enemies, Fuad Shukr, a top commander with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\nHamas has not yet commented on the Israeli military announcement of Deif's death, but the group previously claimed Deif survived the July airstrike. Israel's military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, died in the attack, while Gaza health officials said more than 90 others -- including displaced civilians -- were also killed.\n\nIn a post hailing Deif's death, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described the Hamas military chief as \"the 'Osama Bin Laden of Gaza.'\" \"This is a significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas as a military and governing authority in Gaza, and in the achievement of the goals of this war,\" Gallant wrote in a post on X.\n\nDeif, a mysterious figure who has been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list for decades, had previously survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, Reuters reports. He lost an eye and suffered serious leg wounds in one of those attempts, according to Hamas sources. Deif never appeared in public and his voice was only heard in rare audio recordings -- including one broadcast as the Oct. 7 attacks began.\n\nThe recent rash of killings of Israel's high-profile enemies come as negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas continue against a backdrop of fears that a wider regional conflict could erupt. Iran has already vowed to retaliate against Israel over the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nIsrael's strike against Shukr in Lebanon, meanwhile, was itself a retaliation for a rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children on a soccer field. Israel accused Hezbollah of being responsible for the attack, while the Lebanese group issued a rare denial of responsibility for the killings.\n\nAlmost 39,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military campaign in the enclave almost 10 months ago, according to the Gaza health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Osama bin Laden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Israel-Says-It-Killed-Hamas-Oct-7-Architect-Mohammed-Deif.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781633", "eventUri": "eng-9781633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 250, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 479, "textEnd": 486}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets struck a compound in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on July 13, killing Deif.\n\nIran Vows to Attack Israel in Retaliatory Strikes Following Hamas Leader's Death\n\nThe IDF also released footage of the airstrike that it described as the \"moment of [Deif's] elimination.\"\n\nThe announcement of Deif's death comes the day after Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, was killed in an airstrike in Iran. Israel has not yet confirmed or denied responsibility for that attack in Tehran. It did, however, claim a separate airstrike in Beirut hours earlier that killed another of its enemies, Fuad Shukr, a top commander with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\nHamas has not yet commented on the Israeli military announcement of Deif's death, but the group previously claimed Deif survived the July airstrike. Israel's military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, died in the attack, while Gaza health officials said more than 90 others -- including displaced civilians -- were also killed.\n\nIn a post hailing Deif's death, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described the Hamas military chief as \"the 'Osama Bin Laden of Gaza.'\" \"This is a significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas as a military and governing authority in Gaza, and in the achievement of the goals of this war,\" Gallant wrote in a post on X.\n\nDeif, a mysterious figure who has been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list for decades, had previously survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, Reuters reports. He lost an eye and suffered serious leg wounds in one of those attempts, according to Hamas sources. Deif never appeared in public and his voice was only heard in rare audio recordings -- including one broadcast as the Oct. 7 attacks began.\n\nThe recent rash of killings of Israel's high-profile enemies come as negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas continue against a backdrop of fears that a wider regional conflict could erupt. Iran has already vowed to retaliate against Israel over the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nIsrael's strike against Shukr in Lebanon, meanwhile, was itself a retaliation for a rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children on a soccer field. Israel accused Hezbollah of being responsible for the attack, while the Lebanese group issued a rare denial of responsibility for the killings.\n\nAlmost 39,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military campaign in the enclave almost 10 months ago, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Mr Deif and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the October 7 attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defences, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Mr Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil ceasefire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Mr Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas's military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely will not end with Mr Deif's alleged death.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri and believed to be 58 or 59, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nMr Deif, like Mr Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s. Gaza is home to several such camps whose inhabitants fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the country's establishment in 1948.\n\nIn 1989, during the height of the uprising, Mr Deif was arrested by Israel but later released.\n\nMichael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, is one of the few Israelis to have met Mr Deif personally when he was a quiet, bookish 16-year-old imprisoned in a detention facility in Khan Younis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"He was very, very patriotic, very involved in the intifada,\" Mr Koubi said.\n\nHe would go on to found Hamas's network in the West Bank in 1993, the year that Israel reached an interim peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli military said. That same year, he was also promoted to the head of Hamas's armed wing, it said.\n\nIsrael holds Mr Deif responsible for plotting many attacks that killed scores of Israeli civilians, including the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldier Nahshon Wachsman in the West Bank in October 1994, and suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in 1996.\n\nThe attacks in the mid-90s are widely believed to have tipped the 1996 Israeli election in favour of Benjamin Netanyahu, who eked out a surprise victory over the more moderate front-runner Shimon Peres.\n\nUnder Mr Netanyahu's lengthy leadership and his successive nationalist governments, the prospects of an independent Palestinian state have grown dimmer, chances that have further diminished because of Hamas's attack and the war.\n\nUnder Mr Deif's watch, Hamas developed its rocket programme, beginning with rudimentary weapons capable of travelling just a few kilometres and evolving into an arsenal that struck deep inside Israel, reaching its seaside metropolis Tel Aviv and the foothills of Jerusalem.\n\nMr Deif is also thought to have helped expand Hamas's labyrinth of underground tunnels in Gaza -- where he is believed to have hidden during the ongoing war.\n\nMr Koubi said Mr Deif's fingerprints were all over the October 7 attack, from its sweeping scope to the more surprising aspects such as the paragliders who flew over the fence and landed in the border communities at the start of the attack.\n\n\"He was very creative,\" he said.\n\nThere are few photos of Mr Deif, and he is thought to be unrecognisable to most Palestinians.\n\nHe has been so elusive that even his appearance was a point of speculation. Some media reports say he was paralysed and used a wheelchair for years following injuries he sustained during past assassination attempts, while others reported he was able to walk unassisted.\n\nIn 2014, Palestinian media said his wife and two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, one of the many failed attempts to kill him.\n\nMoshe Fuzaylov, a long-time investigator and former senior official for the Shin Bet, said that if Mr Deif was killed, it could open a window of opportunity where Hamas will be in disarray, including over Mr Haniyeh's death.

It did however confirm it killed a senior commander of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement in Beirut on Tuesday.\n\nHezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. The latest killings have raised concern of a further escalation in hostilities in the Middle East, with threats of revenge against Israel, which has said it does not seek regional war but that it would respond forcefully to any attack.\n\nSTRING OF DEATHS\n\nOn Thursday, Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Haniyeh's death would not weaken the group's fighters in Gaza.\n\n\"Despite the crime, Hamas remains strong and the confrontation in Gaza is continuing,\" he said.\n\nBut his death was the latest in a series that has targeted the group's leaders. Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in a drone strike in Beirut in January. In March, Israel said it had killed Marwan Issa, Deif's deputy.\n\nThe United States confirmed Issa's death in an Israeli operation. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied his death.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Deif's death was a milestone in Israel's goal of destroying Hamas' military wing, known as Al-Qassam Brigades.\n\n\"Hamas is disintegrating,\" Gallant said on X. \"Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated.\"\n\nOne of Hamas' most dominant figures, Deif rose through the group's ranks over 30 years, developing its network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise.\n\nHe has topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings. Scores of Palestinians were killed in the airstrike that killed him, medics in Gaza say.\n\nThe other mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack, Yahaya Sinwar, is still believed to be directing military operations, possibly from bunkers beneath Gaza, while playing a leading role in indirect negotiations with Israel for a prisoner swap deal.\n\nBut now on the 300th day of warfare in Gaza, hopes for a hostage deal and ceasefire have dimmed.\n\nThe war erupted when militants led by Hamas stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry says more than 39,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in the subsequent Israeli offensive. The ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its fatality reports.\n\nIsrael has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza and says around a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.\n\nOn Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck against dozens of Hamas targets in Gaza, including fighters and infrastructure. At least 13 people had been killed in the Israeli bombardments across the enclave, Gaza medics said.\n\nAn Israeli missile that hit a vehicle at the entrance of Al-Maghazi district in central Gaza killed six people and five more were killed in a strike on a house in nearby Nusseirat, medics said, while a airstrike in Gaza City killed two others.\n\nEast of Al-Maghazi, residents said tanks were firing as they tried to push deeper into the area.\n\nEarlier, Israeli authorities released 15 Palestinians whom it had detained in the past months in Gaza. The men arrived for treatment at a Gaza hospital, complaining of abuse during their detention. Israel denies torture and is investigating suspected abuse of detainees.\n\n(Editing by Gareth Jones and Angus MacSwan)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

The announcement comes a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas' top political leader.\n\nIsrael believes that Deif, the head of Hamas' military, and Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, were the chief architects of the Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. Sinwar is believed to remain in hiding in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has not confirmed or denied it was behind Tuesday's strike in Tehran that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political chief. Hamas has said Deif survived the July attack in Gaza and did not immediately comment on the military's announcement of confirmation.\n\nThe killing of two of Hamas' most senior figures brings a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has said that he will not end the campaign in Gaza until Israel destroys Hamas' military capabilities.\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor?

And Iran has vowed vengeance for the strike on its soil, raising fears of an all-out regional war.\n\nIsrael targeted Deif in a July 13 strike that hit a compound on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military said at the time that another Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, was killed. More than 90 other people, including displaced civilians in nearby tents, were killed in the strike, Gaza health officials said at the time.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Israeli military said that \"following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nIn its 10-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed some 39,480 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,100 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, the vast majority crammed into tent camps in the southwest corner of the territory, with limited food and water.\n\nDeif was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the 1990s and led the unit for decades. Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe remained a mysterious, underground figure in Gaza. He never appeared in public, was hardly ever photographed and only rarely was his voice heard in audio statements. He survived a string of Israeli assassination attempts.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Mr Deif and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the October 7 attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defences, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza.\n\nThe attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Mr Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil ceasefire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Mr Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas's military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely will not end with Mr Deif's alleged death.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri and believed to be 58 or 59, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nMr Deif, like Mr Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s.

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Mr Deif and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the October 7th attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defences, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza.\n\nThe attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Mr Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil ceasefire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Mr Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas' military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely will not end with Mr Deif's alleged death.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri and believed to be 58 or 59, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nMr Deif, like Mr Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s. Gaza is home to several such camps whose inhabitants fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the country's establishment in 1948.\n\nHe is believed to have joined Hamas shortly after the formation of the Islamist Palestinian group in the late 1980s, at the onset of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. The group's ideology calls for armed resistance and the violent destruction of Israel.\n\nIn 1989, during the height of the uprising, Mr Deif was arrested by Israel but later released.\n\nMichael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, is one of the few Israelis to have met Mr Deif personally when he was a quiet, bookish 16-year-old imprisoned in a detention facility in Khan Younis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"He was very, very patriotic, very involved in the intifada,\" Mr Koubi said.\n\nHe would go on to found Hamas's network in the West Bank in 1993, the year that Israel reached an interim peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli military said.

Deif was eliminated in a strike carried out by the Israeli Army.\n\nHe was the mastermind of the October 07 attacks on Israel, in which close to a thousand people were killed. Mohammed Dief was a crippled man who escaped numerous assassination attempts on his life by Israel to give a tough time to Israel.\n\nDeif was a one-time bombmaker and the architect of a decade-long programme to dig a network of tunnels under Gaza. His ability to outwit Israel's military while killing soldiers alike has earned him the reverence of Palestinian militants.\n\nHis numerous unsuccessful assassination attempts solidified his reputation for exceptional evations skills, leading his adversaries to dub him as \"The Cat with Nine Lives\".\n\nHe was the head of Hamas's military wing since 2002. Just like Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Hamas's handicapped spiritual leader, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in 2004, the 57-year-old Deif has run the Qassam brigades from a wheelchair for the last two decades.\n\nHe was born as Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza during the 1960s. Gaza, then had been under Egyptian control (from 1948 to 1967). Between 1967 to 2005, it was under Israeli rule and then it came under the Palestinian Authority from 2005 to 2007.\n\nDeif's relatives were part of the Fedayeen Palestinian fighters, who in the 1950s launched attacks on illegal Israeli posts. Like many Palestinian leaders, who joined the nation's liberation movements during their university period, Deif's relationship with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood-inspired movement, began at the Islamic University of Gaza.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Deif like many Palestinians including founders of Hamas was angry about the Oslo Accords signed by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), that ceded many Palestinian lands to Israel.\n\nUnder the influence of Yahya Ayyash and Adnan al-Ghoul, who were two of Hamas's top military strategists prior to their assassinations by Israel, Deif became part of the Qassam Brigades, which was founded shortly after the Oslo Accords. Since 2002, Deif led the Qassam Brigades, the military offshoot of Hamas.\n\nHis wife and two kids including an infant son were killed in assassination attempts by Israel. He lost an eye, arm and leg in those assassination attempts. In 2007, a Hamas coup led it to establish its control.\n\nIn late 2010, Deif wrote an article in which he outlined the group's aim according to his own vision of the conflict, saying that \"Palestine will remain ours including Al Quds (Jerusalem), Al Aqsa (mosque), its towns and villages from the (Mediterranean) Sea to the (Jordan) River, from its North to its South.

Under his command, it carried out dozens of suicide bombings against Israelis on buses and at cafes and built up a formidable arsenal of rockets that could strike deep into Israel and often did.\n\nHe gained mythical status among Palestinians, surviving a string of Israeli assassination attempts and not showing his face in public for decades. For years, he topped Israel's most-wanted list.\n\nIsrael says Mr Deif and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, were the chief architects of the October 7 attack. Together they succeeded in foiling Israel's vaunted border defences, surprising the region's most powerful military and unleashing an unprecedented attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 others hostage into Gaza.\n\nThe attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nOn the morning of the attack, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Mr Deif announcing the \"Al Aqsa Flood\" operation. In the message, he railed against military raids in the occupied West Bank and violence in east Jerusalem and called on all Palestinians to rise up and take part.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"Kill, burn, destroy and block the roads. Make them understand that the Al Aqsa Flood is more powerful than they think and believe.\"\n\nThe military's claim that he was dead came a day after Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran.\n\nThose developments could help set the tone for the remainder of the war. They could imperil ceasefire talks and raise fears of a regional escalation.\n\nBut the alleged demise of Mr Deif, a long-wanted figure said to be behind the deadliest attack in Israel's history, would also be a major win for Israel. It could present Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a political off-ramp to end the war, allowing him to retreat from his lofty promises of \"total victory\" while showing Israelis that Hamas's military capabilities suffered a debilitating blow.\n\nAt the same time, his killing would be a significant setback for Hamas, both symbolically and strategically, since it may have lost a unique player in the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel, even if that struggle likely will not end with Mr Deif's alleged death.\n\nBorn Mohammed al-Masri and believed to be 58 or 59, his nom de guerre, Deif, means \"guest\" in Arabic -- a moniker that reflected his tendency to change locations frequently to hide from Israel.\n\nMr Deif, like Mr Sinwar, grew up in a refugee camp of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis in the mid-1960s. Gaza is home to several such camps whose inhabitants fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the war surrounding the country's establishment in 1948.\n\nHe is believed to have joined Hamas shortly after the formation of the Islamist Palestinian group in the late 1980s, at the onset of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. The group's ideology calls for armed resistance and the violent destruction of Israel.\n\nIn 1989, during the height of the uprising, Mr Deif was arrested by Israel but later released.\n\nMichael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, is one of the few Israelis to have met Mr Deif personally when he was a quiet, bookish 16-year-old imprisoned in a detention facility in Khan Younis for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"He was very, very patriotic, very involved in the intifada,\" Mr Koubi said.\n\nHe would go on to found Hamas's network in the West Bank in 1993, the year that Israel reached an interim peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli military said. That same year, he was also promoted to the head of Hamas's armed wing, it said.\n\nIsrael holds Mr Deif responsible for plotting many attacks that killed scores of Israeli civilians, including the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldier Nahshon Wachsman in the West Bank in October 1994, and suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in 1996.\n\nThe attacks in the mid-90s are widely believed to have tipped the 1996 Israeli election in favour of Benjamin Netanyahu, who eked out a surprise victory over the more moderate front-runner Shimon Peres.\n\nUnder Mr Netanyahu's lengthy leadership and his successive nationalist governments, the prospects of an independent Palestinian state have grown dimmer, chances that have further diminished because of Hamas's attack and the war.\n\nUnder Mr Deif's watch, Hamas developed its rocket programme, beginning with rudimentary weapons capable of travelling just a few kilometres and evolving into an arsenal that struck deep inside Israel, reaching its seaside metropolis Tel Aviv and the foothills of Jerusalem.\n\nHe was also in command when soldier Gilad Schalit was kidnapped into Gaza in 2006. Mr Schalit would be released five years later in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a trade that set Mr Sinwar free.\n\nMr Deif is also thought to have helped expand Hamas's labyrinth of underground tunnels in Gaza -- where he is believed to have hidden during the ongoing war.\n\nMr Koubi said Mr Deif's fingerprints were all over the October 7 attack, from its sweeping scope to the more surprising aspects such as the paragliders who flew over the fence and landed in the border communities at the start of the attack.\n\n\"He was very creative,\" he said.\n\nThere are few photos of Mr Deif, and he is thought to be unrecognisable to most Palestinians.\n\nHe has been so elusive that even his appearance was a point of speculation. Some media reports say he was paralysed and used a wheelchair for years following injuries he sustained during past assassination attempts, while others reported he was able to walk unassisted.\n\nIn 2014, Palestinian media said his wife and two children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, one of the many failed attempts to kill him.\n\nMoshe Fuzaylov, a long-time investigator and former senior official for the Shin Bet, said that if Mr Deif was killed, it could open a window of opportunity where Hamas will be in disarray, including over Mr Haniyeh's death. It could push the group toward a ceasefire with Israel while they are in a weakened state.\n\n\"It's a morale hit and a very strong operational hit, and it changes this organisation from something that has two legs to lean on to one that is limping,\" he said.\n\nBut it would not necessarily be a death blow for Hamas.\n\n\"Israel has targeted Hamas political and military leaders in the past,\"

received additional intelligence to confirm Deif's death to a complete certainty.\n\nThe IDF on Thursday confirmed 100% that its July 13 airstrike targeting Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif succeeded in killing him.\n\nThe military said that only in recent hours it had received additional intelligence to confirm Deif's death to a complete certainty, taking into account that the defense establishment had been confident for the last two weeks that its air strike had killed him.\n\nPressed, the IDF would not only not reveal what the new confirmatory information was, but would also not share what category of information it was.\n\nIn such cases in the past, the information is often a very sensitive human spy or a very sensitive electronic spying element which the defense establishment feels would be lost if even a hint of who or what it was comes out.\n\nIDF sources indicated that some members of Hamas and Hezbollah have known for some time that Deif was dead, but that others may not have known because portions of Hamas are currently cut off from the broader Hamas operational network.\n\nThe IDF's July announcement\n\nAlready on July 21, the military had revealed that Deif was to a 100% certainty in the room with Hamas Khan Yunis Brigade Commander Rafah Salame, when the bombs which were dropped and killed Salame struck.\n\nThe fact that Salame was in fact killed and the size of the bombs had already made it a practical certainty that Deif was also killed, though IDF sources until Thursday had cautioned that in one of the prior failed attempted assassinations of Deif, he was in the room which was hit, but happened to be in a tiny part of the room which was just shielded enough by the surrounding objects and setting to survive.\n\nAs part of the assassination, the air force had kept a series of five different pairs of aircraft and drones rotating through the role of hovering and passing by the residence where Deif was expected to visit Salame, such that the moment the war cabinet approved an operation, the air force would be able to open fire in practically no time at all.\n\nThis is different from the standard situation where aircraft only take off to strike a target after approval is given which creates a certain amount of gap time when a target might escape.\n\nAir force units were in the sky for more than a day and a

After the October 7 attack, he was believed to be directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues. Rising through the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's tunnel network and bomb-making expertise, making him one of Israel's most wanted figures.\n\nBorn as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp, Deif joined Hamas during the first Intifada, which began in 1987. He was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention. Deif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry, and biology. His wife, seven-month-old son, and three-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.\n\nHamas did not immediately respond to the Israeli announcement of Deif's death. His survival over the years had made him a folk hero among some Palestinians, despite being held responsible for numerous Israeli deaths in suicide bombings. Deif, along with Yahya Sinwar and Marwan Issa, formed a military council that planned the October 7 raid, the deadliest attack in Israel's history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,200 people and the taking of more than 250 hostages.\n\nThe attack, named \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" by Deif, was seen as retaliation for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.

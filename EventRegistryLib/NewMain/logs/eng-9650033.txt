(AP) -- Former President Donald Trump used the word \"horrible\" in talking about Milwaukee -- the city where he will accept the Republican nomination next month -- during a closed-door meeting Thursday with GOP congressmen, according to several people in the room who spoke afterward.\n\nThe comment, first reported by Punchbowl News while the meeting was in progress, immediately drew disagreements from those there about what Trump meant.\n\nSeveral congressmen who support Trump and attended the meeting argued he was referring to crime and voter fraud. Trump frequently denounces Democratic-led cities as unsafe -- even as violent crime decreased nationally in the most recent FBI statistics -- and repeats falsehoods about his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign and his Democratic allies pounced on the reported remark even as Wisconsin Republicans contested how it was being interpreted. Biden posted a photo on the X social platform of himself greeting the Milwaukee Bucks after their 2021 NBA championship with the message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee.\"\n\nMilwaukee is hosting the Republican National Convention starting July 15 and is the largest Democratic stronghold in swing-state Wisconsin.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be in Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally on Tuesday, just three weeks before heading to Milwaukee for the convention.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung posted on X that Trump \"was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin, said Trump was talking about the \"terrible or horrible\" crime rate in the city.\n\n\"He was directly referring to crime in Milwaukee,\" said Van Orden, who told The Associated Press he was sitting just feet from the former president.\n\nHe said Republicans in the room concurred. \"They're like, yeah, crime is terrible.\"\n\nU.S. Rep, Scott Fitzgerald, also from Wisconsin, told WISN-TV in Milwaukee that Trump was referring to election integrity.\n\n\"That's where the comment came from, that Milwaukee's just terrible,\" Fitzgerald said. \"What he was talking about was the elections in Milwaukee, their concerns about them.\"\n\nBut Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents southeast Wisconsin, disputed that Trump made the comment.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" Steil posted on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, said he never heard Trump call Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\"\n\n\"What I heard is to make sure there's election integrity in Milwaukee,\" Tiffany said in a telephone interview. \"He's talking about the states that are in play and the states of greatest importance and Wisconsin is top of the list.\"\n\nA Trump aide and two attorneys who advised him in 2020 were charged with felonies last week in Wisconsin for their roles in a scheme to get Republicans to cast Wisconsin's electoral ballots to Trump even though he lost the state.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Banks, of Indiana, said he was also in the room and \"Trump never disparaged Milwaukee.\"\n\n\"Just another Democrat hoax,\" Banks posted on X.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, when asked about Trump's reported remarks, said at a news conference, \"If Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you buddy.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents and lives in Milwaukee, made a nod to Trump's recent felony convictions in her response. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on July 11, days before the convention opens.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" Moore posted on X.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, said on X that Milwaukee is \"part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation. Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so.\" She used the Trump comment in a fundraising plea hours after it was first reported.\n\nLocal and statewide Democratic leaders, including Gov. Tony Evers, worked with Republicans to land the convention this summer.\n\nEvers, in response to Trump's comment, posted on X: \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He followed it with an emoji of a clown face.\n\nMilwaukee was supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but that was moved almost entirely online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nAvenu Insights & Analytics Unveils Groundbreaking Short-Term Rental Compliance Solution: Avenu | STR\n\nAttorney Bryan Greenberg Speaks On Litigation Strategies At Florida Workers' Advocates Conference\n\nChurch of Scientology's Documentary 'Operation: Do Something About It' Wins Platinum at Viddy Awards", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Tiffany", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Tiffany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F.

(AP) -- Former President Donald Trump used the word \"horrible\" in talking about Milwaukee -- the city where he will accept the Republican nomination next month -- during a closed-door meeting Thursday with GOP congressmen, according to several people in the room who spoke afterward.\n\nThe comment, first reported by Punchbowl News while the meeting was in progress, immediately drew disagreements from those there about what Trump meant.\n\nSeveral congressmen who support Trump and attended the meeting argued he was referring to crime and voter fraud.

Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin, said Trump was talking about the \"terrible or horrible\" crime rate in the city.\n\n\"He was directly referring to crime in Milwaukee,\" said Van Orden, who told The Associated Press he was sitting just feet from the former president.\n\nHe said Republicans in the room concurred. \"They're like, yeah, crime is terrible.\"\n\nU.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman and Scott Fitzgerald, also both of Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump was referring to the upcoming election.\n\nBut Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents southeast Wisconsin, disputed that Trump made the comment.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" Steil posted on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, said he never heard Trump call Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\"\n\n\"What I heard is to make sure there's election integrity in Milwaukee,\" Tiffany said in a telephone interview. \"He's talking about the states that are in play and the states of greatest importance and Wisconsin is top of the list.\"\n\nA Trump aide and two attorneys who advised him in 2020 were charged with felonies last week in Wisconsin for their roles in a scheme to get Republicans to cast Wisconsin's electoral ballots to Trump even though he lost the state.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election.

His remarks came five days before he is scheduled to visit Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally.\n\n\"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" Trump said, several lawmakers confirmed to the USA TODAY Network. The remark was first reported by Punchbowl News.\n\nRepublican members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation had varying accounts of the comment's context, including one who denied it was uttered at all.\n\nU.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman of the 6th Congressional District, Scott Fitzgerald of the 5th Congressional District and Tom Tiffany of the 7th Congressional District all told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Trump made the comments when speaking about the upcoming election. Grothman said Trump \"was concerned about the election in Milwaukee\" and that he thought Trump \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\" He suggested Trump had concerns that Republicans \"didn't do very well in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAn aide to Fitzgerald also told the Journal Sentinel that Trump's comments \"were about election integrity.\"\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a post on X that \"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as.\" Cheung said the former president was talking about crime and election issues, though members of Wisconsin's delegation didn't agree on which topic Trump was discussing.\n\nTrump has repeatedly falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020 and has at times blamed Milwaukee's election officials for the election outcome, baselessly claiming absentee voting in the state's largest city was rife with fraud.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a freshman Republican who represents Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District in western Wisconsin, said in a post on the social media platform X that the former president was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\"\n\nMore: In context: Are these two recent statements about crime in Milwaukee fair and accurate?\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District, said: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nTiffany disputed Van Orden's characterization of the comments. He said about Trump: \"I think he kind of lumps all those things together, that there were some real improprieties (with the election) in Wisconsin, and cites Milwaukee as a result of it.\"\n\nThere's no evidence to support that Wisconsin's election was tainted by cheating or fraud in 2020. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nTrump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, Joe Biden respond to Trump comment\n\nIn response to Trump's description of Milwaukee, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said, \"Donald Trump was talking about things that he thinks are horrible. All of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you, buddy.\"\n\nAnd Biden tweeted a short message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" with a photo of the president at the 2021 celebration of the Milwaukee Bucks' NBA championship.\n\nA Republican National Committee spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment from the Journal Sentinel. But a convention spokeswoman offered CBS58 another explanation, saying Trump was referring to an ongoing debate over where protests should be allowed to occur in the city during the July convention.\n\nStill, a spokesman for the state GOP said Trump's comments were related to elections and added Trump \"is correct to highlight the embarrassing mismanagement of elections in Milwaukee.\"\n\nHe cited the conviction of a former Milwaukee elections official who ordered three military absentee ballots under fake names and sent them to a Republican lawmaker who embraces conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nHe also cited an incident in March 2023 during which more than 200 voters in one Milwaukee Common Council district race were sent ballots that included the incorrect order for the candidates.\n\n\"Election integrity in Wisconsin matters, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin is doing its part to protect the vote,\" Republican Party of Wisconsin spokesman Matt Fisher said in a statement.\n\nGrothman later said he was confused by the mixed messages from Wisconsin's delegation and reiterated Trump was referring to election issues.\n\n\"I guess you can take it however you wanna take it,\" he said of Trump's comments.\n\n\"The RNC still chose Milwaukee to come to, right?\" Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said.\n\n\"It is my hope that not only our former president but everybody who is going to be embarking on Milwaukee sees everything that we have to offer. We are a great county on a great lake ... I can't wait to really prove him wrong and let him know what we have to offer.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Wisconsin Democrats blasted Trump.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents Milwaukee in Congress, said in a post on X, referring to Trump's recent conviction in a hush money trial.\n\nGarren Randolph, manager of Biden's reelection effort in Wisconsin, said the city \"deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values.\"\n\n\"If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city,\" Randolph said.\n\nIn a post on X, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers wrote, \"add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He included the clown emoji.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for reelection this fall, said \"Milwaukee makes the greatest beer, brats, and motorcycles in the world. It's home to some of our most vibrant communities, hardest workers, and is a part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so,\" she said on X.\n\nAsked about Trump's comments, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who is challenging Baldwin, suggested the city needed improvement in its leadership.\n\n\"I love the city of Milwaukee and it's sad to see how poorly Democrats have run it for generations -- and that includes Sen. Baldwin and President Biden,\" he said in a statement. \"Milwaukeeans deserve better and that's why I'm campaigning across the city to show people there's a different path forward.\"\n\nMore: Here's how social media is reacting to Trump's 'horrible city' comment about Milwaukee\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, who was not in the meeting with Trump, told the Journal Sentinel it sounded like Trump's remarks were \"distorted and misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"The media is gonna take whatever he says, distort it and try to use it against him,\" Johnson said in a brief interview.\n\nThursday's meeting was the first time Trump has visited Capitol Hill since leaving office in 2021.\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are designed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury on 34 felony charges in a hush money trial and just a month before he is scheduled to be nominated in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"Milwaukee is an amazing city, attracting millions of visitors every year who fall in love with everything we know makes this city great,\" Peggy Williams-Smith, president and chief executive officer at Visit Milwaukee, a publicly funded nonprofit group that promotes Milwaukee as a travel destination, said in a statement responding to Trump's comments.\n\nAlison Dirr, Vanessa Swales, Jessie Opoien, Jolan Kruse and Tom Daykin of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType":

(AP) - Former President Donald Trump used the word \"horrible\" in talking about Milwaukee - the city where he will accept the Republican nomination next month - during a closed-door meeting Thursday with GOP congressmen, according to several people in the room who spoke afterward.\n\nThe comment, first reported by Punchbowl News while the meeting was in progress, immediately drew disagreements from those there about what Trump meant.\n\nSeveral congressmen who support Trump and attended the meeting argued he was referring to crime and voter fraud. Trump frequently denounces Democratic-led cities as unsafe - even as violent crime decreased nationally in the most recent FBI statistics - and repeats falsehoods about his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u00b4s campaign and his Democratic allies pounced on the reported remark even as Wisconsin Republicans contested how it was being interpreted. Biden posted a photo on the X social platform of himself greeting the Milwaukee Bucks after their 2021 NBA championship with the message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee.\"\n\nMilwaukee is hosting the Republican National Convention starting July 15 and is the largest Democratic stronghold in swing-state Wisconsin.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be in Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally on Tuesday, just three weeks before heading to Milwaukee for the convention.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives to the Capitol Hill Club, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung posted on X that Trump \"was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin, said Trump was talking about the \"terrible or horrible\" crime rate in the city.\n\n\"He was directly referring to crime in Milwaukee,\" said Van Orden, who told The Associated Press he was sitting just feet from the former president.\n\nHe said Republicans in the room concurred. \"They\u00b4re like, yeah, crime is terrible.\"\n\nU.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman and Scott Fitzgerald, also both of Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump was referring to the upcoming election.\n\nBut Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents southeast Wisconsin, disputed that Trump made the comment.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" Steil posted on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, said he never heard Trump call Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\"\n\n\"What I heard is to make sure there\u00b4s election integrity in Milwaukee,\" Tiffany said in a telephone interview. \"He\u00b4s talking about the states that are in play and the states of greatest importance and Wisconsin is top of the list.\"\n\nA Trump aide and two attorneys who advised him in 2020 were charged with felonies last week in Wisconsin for their roles in a scheme to get Republicans to cast Wisconsin's electoral ballots to Trump even though he lost the state.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Banks, of Indiana, said he was also in the room and \"Trump never disparaged Milwaukee.\"\n\n\"Just another Democrat hoax,\" Banks posted on X.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, when asked about Trump's reported remarks, said at a news conference, \"If Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you buddy.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents and lives in Milwaukee, made a nod to Trump\u00b4s recent felony convictions in her response. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on July 11, days before the convention opens.\n\n\"Once he\u00b4s settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" Moore posted on X.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, said on X that Milwaukee is \"part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation. Donald Trump wouldn\u00b4t understand even if a jury told him so.\" She used the Trump comment in a fundraising plea hours after it was first reported.\n\nLocal and statewide Democratic leaders, including Gov. Tony Evers, worked with Republicans to land the convention this summer.\n\nEvers, in response to Trump's comment, posted on X: \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He followed it with an emoji of a clown face.\n\nMilwaukee was supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but that was moved almost entirely online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n___

His remarks came five days before he is scheduled to visit Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally.\n\n\"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" Trump said, several lawmakers confirmed to the USA TODAY Network. The remark was first reported by Punchbowl News.\n\nRepublican members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation had varying accounts of the comment's context, including one who denied it was uttered at all.\n\nU.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman of the 6th Congressional District, Scott Fitzgerald of the 5th Congressional District and Tom Tiffany of the 7th Congressional District all told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Trump made the comments when speaking about the upcoming election. Grothman said Trump \"was concerned about the election in Milwaukee\" and that he thought Trump \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\" He suggested Trump had concerns that Republicans \"didn't do very well in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAn aide to Fitzgerald also told the Journal Sentinel that Trump's comments \"were about election integrity.\"\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a post on X that \"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as.\" Cheung said the former president was talking about crime and election issues, though members of Wisconsin's delegation didn't agree on which topic Trump was discussing.\n\nTrump has repeatedly falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020 and has at times blamed Milwaukee's election officials for the election outcome, baselessly claiming absentee voting in the state's largest city was rife with fraud.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a freshman Republican who represents Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District in western Wisconsin, said in a post on the social media platform X that the former president was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\"\n\nMore: In context: Are these two recent statements about crime in Milwaukee fair and accurate?\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District, said: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nTiffany disputed Van Orden's characterization of the comments. He said about Trump: \"I think he kind of lumps all those things together, that there were some real improprieties (with the election) in Wisconsin, and cites Milwaukee as a result of it.\"\n\nThere's no evidence to support that Wisconsin's election was tainted by cheating or fraud in 2020. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nTrump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes.\n\nIn response to Trump's description of Milwaukee, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said, \"Donald Trump was talking about things that he thinks are horrible. All of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you, buddy.\"\n\nAnd Biden tweeted a short message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" with a photo of the president at the 2021 celebration of the Milwaukee Bucks' NBA championship.\n\nA Republican National Committee spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment from the Journal Sentinel. But a convention spokeswoman offered CBS58 another explanation, saying Trump was referring to an ongoing debate over where protests should be allowed to occur in the city during the July convention.\n\nStill, a spokesman for the state GOP said Trump's comments were related to elections and added Trump \"is correct to highlight the embarrassing mismanagement of elections in Milwaukee.\"\n\nHe cited the conviction of a former Milwaukee elections official who ordered three military absentee ballots under fake names and sent them to a Republican lawmaker who embraces conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nHe also cited an incident in March 2023 during which more than 200 voters in one Milwaukee Common Council district race were sent ballots that included the incorrect order for the candidates.\n\n\"Election integrity in Wisconsin matters, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin is doing its part to protect the vote,\" Republican Party of Wisconsin spokesman Matt Fisher said in a statement.\n\nGrothman later said he was confused by the mixed messages from Wisconsin's delegation and reiterated Trump was referring to election issues.\n\n\"I guess you can take it however you wanna take it,\" he said of Trump's comments.\n\n\"The RNC still chose Milwaukee to come to, right?\" Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said.\n\n\"It is my hope that not only our former president but everybody who is going to be embarking on Milwaukee sees everything that we have to offer. We are a great county on a great lake ... I can't wait to really prove him wrong and let him know what we have to offer.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Wisconsin Democrats blasted Trump.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents Milwaukee in Congress, said in a post on X, referring to Trump's recent conviction in a hush money trial.\n\nGarren Randolph, manager of Biden's reelection effort in Wisconsin, said the city \"deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values.\"\n\n\"If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city,\" Randolph said.\n\nIn a post on X, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers wrote, \"add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He included the clown emoji.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for reelection this fall, said \"Milwaukee makes the greatest beer, brats, and motorcycles in the world. It's home to some of our most vibrant communities, hardest workers, and is a part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so,\" she said on X.\n\nAsked about Trump's comments, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who is challenging Baldwin, suggested the city needed improvement in its leadership.\n\n\"I love the city of Milwaukee and it's sad to see how poorly Democrats have run it for generations -- and that includes Sen. Baldwin and President Biden,\" he said in a statement. \"Milwaukeeans deserve better and that's why I'm campaigning across the city to show people there's a different path forward.\"\n\nMore: Here's how social media is reacting to Trump's 'horrible city' comment about Milwaukee\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, who was not in the meeting with Trump, told the Journal Sentinel it sounded like Trump's remarks were \"distorted and misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"The media is gonna take whatever he says, distort it and try to use it against him,\" Johnson said in a brief interview.\n\nThursday's meeting was the first time Trump has visited Capitol Hill since leaving office in 2021.\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are designed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury on 34 felony charges in a hush money trial and just a month before he is scheduled to be nominated in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"Milwaukee is an amazing city, attracting millions of visitors every year who fall in love with everything we know makes this city great,\" Peggy Williams-Smith, president and chief executive officer at Visit Milwaukee, a publicly funded nonprofit group that promotes Milwaukee as a travel destination, said in a statement responding to Trump's comments.\n\nAlison Dirr, Vanessa Swales, Jessie Opoien, Jolan Kruse and Tom Daykin of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.\n\nMolly Beck and Lawrence Andrea can be reached at

It is the former president's first visit to the Hill since Jan. 6, when a mob stormed the Capitol to protest his losing the 2020 election.\n\nAt one point, Trump told the Republicans \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" according to Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News.\n\nMilwaukee is set to host the Republican National Convention on July 15, where Trump is expected to be officially named the party's nominee for the 2024 election. The Wisconsin gathering comes just a day after Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in the hush money case where he was convicted of 34 felonies.\n\nTrump's blasting the RNC host city drew a strong reaction on social media.\n\n\"To all of the local elected officials falling over themselves to welcome the GOP to Milwaukee.....you reap what you sow,\" X user Eric Couto wrote.\n\n\"Hey Milwaukee, Trump thinks your city is horrible,\" fellow user @speakout_April noted.\n\n\"Good thing Wisconsin isn't important,\" user Jason Scalese noted.

Biden posted a photo on the X social platform of himself greeting the Milwaukee Bucks after their 2021 NBA championship with the message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee.\"\n\nMilwaukee is hosting the Republican National Convention starting July 15 and is the largest Democratic stronghold in swing-state Wisconsin.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be in Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally on Tuesday, just three weeks before heading to Milwaukee for the convention.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung posted on X that Trump \"was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin, said Trump was talking about the \"terrible or horrible\" crime rate in the city.\n\n\"He was directly referring to crime in Milwaukee,\" said Van Orden, who told The Associated Press he was sitting just feet from the former president.\n\nHe said Republicans in the room concurred. \"They're like, yeah, crime is terrible.\"\n\nU.S. Reps.

Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, said he never heard Trump call Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\"\n\n\"What I heard is to make sure there's election integrity in Milwaukee,\" Tiffany said in a telephone interview. \"He's talking about the states that are in play and the states of greatest importance and Wisconsin is top of the list.\"\n\nA Trump aide and two attorneys who advised him in 2020 were charged with felonies last week in Wisconsin for their roles in a scheme to get Republicans to cast Wisconsin's electoral ballots to Trump even though he lost the state.\n\nGovernment and outside investigations have uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Banks, of Indiana, said he was also in the room and \"Trump never disparaged Milwaukee.\"\n\n\"Just another Democrat hoax,\" Banks posted on X.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, when asked about Trump's reported remarks, said at a news conference, \"If Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you buddy.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents and lives in Milwaukee, made a nod to Trump's recent felony convictions in her response. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on July 11, days before the convention opens.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" Moore posted on X.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, said on X that Milwaukee is \"part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation. Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so.\" She used the Trump comment in a fundraising plea hours after it was first reported.\n\nLocal and statewide Democratic leaders, including Gov. Tony Evers, worked with Republicans to land the convention this summer.\n\nEvers, in response to Trump's comment, posted on X: \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He followed it with an emoji of a clown face.\n\nMilwaukee was supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but that was moved almost entirely online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "source":

Here's a roundup of some of those responses to Trump's comment and what they indicate about themes in the 2024 presidential election:\n\nSome think Trump's comments about Milwaukee being 'a horrible city' could affect voter turnout\n\nSome posts said Trump's comment would encourage Democratic turnout in Milwaukee while preventing on-the-fence voters in the critical swing state from supporting him. Another pointed out that Trump's comment could resonate with some rural voters.\n\nOthers point out positive features of Milwaukee and Wisconsin\n\nOthers, including Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, pointed out things that make Milwaukee and Wisconsin great, from summer festivals to beer.\n\nComment reignites past Trump false election claims\n\nWisconsin's House Republicans had conflicting stories about what Trump was talking about, but two said Trump was \"concerned about the election in Milwaukee\" or \"election integrity.\"\n\nTrump in the past has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020. Late returns for President Joe Biden in Milwaukee were because of how Milwaukee counts its absentee ballots, not fraud.\n\nTrump's comment sparks discussion on Milwaukee's crime rate\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden said Trump was referring to the city's crime rate, while another pointed out Trump's own criminal conviction.\n\nMilwaukee had double-digit percentage drops in homicides (20%), car theft (23%) and property crime (13%) from 2022 to 2023, though those crimes were up compared to 2019.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, crime in Milwaukee dropped 10% from the same time last year, with homicides down 39%, according to Milwaukee police data.\n\nMore: In context: Are these two recent statements about crime in Milwaukee fair and accurate?\n\nCallback to RNC's website mistake featuring Ho Chi Minh City\n\n\"Well at least he didn't go off on Ho Chi Minh City,\" a Huffington Post reporter tweeted, a reference to a background photo on the RNC's website that showed the city in Vietnam

Milwaukee - our state's largest and most diverse city and home to more than 577,000 people, the Bucks and Brewers, and the country's best beer - deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values.\n\nDonald Trump looks down on Milwaukee, he looks down on Wisconsinites, he looks down on everyone who isn't one of his billionaire donors. But we already knew that - for years, he pushed tax cuts for the top 1% while raising costs for working people and incentivizing companies to ship Wisconsin jobs overseas.\n\nVoters in Milwaukee are fed up with Donald Trump and extreme MAGA Republicans not caring about them. We'll see that at the RNC - and then again in November, when Wisconsinites send Donald Trump packing.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesperson Addy Toevs said in a statement:\n\nIf Donald Trump hates Milwaukee so much, we have one message for him: don't come, we won't miss you - your campaign is barely here in the first place.

(AP) -- Former President Donald Trump used the word \"horrible\" in talking about Milwaukee -- the city where he will accept the Republican nomination next month -- during a closed-door meeting Thursday with GOP congressmen, according to several people in the room who spoke afterward.\n\nThe comment, first reported by Punchbowl News while the meeting was in progress, immediately drew disagreements from those there about what Trump meant.\n\nSeveral congressmen who support Trump and attended the meeting argued he was referring to crime and voter fraud. Trump frequently denounces Democratic-led cities as unsafe -- even as violent crime decreased nationally in the most recent FBI statistics -- and repeats falsehoods about his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Biden posted a photo on the X social platform of himself greeting the Milwaukee Bucks after their 2021 NBA championship with the message: \"I happen to love Milwaukee.\"\n\nMilwaukee is hosting the Republican National Convention starting July 15 and is the largest Democratic stronghold in swing-state Wisconsin.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be in Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign rally on Tuesday, just three weeks before heading to Milwaukee for the convention.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung posted on X that Trump \"was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin, said Trump was talking about the \"terrible or horrible\" crime rate in the city.\n\n\"He was directly referring to crime in Milwaukee,\" said Van Orden, who told The Associated Press he was sitting just feet from the former president.\n\nHe said Republicans in the room concurred. \"They're like, yeah, crime is terrible.\"\n\nU.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman and Scott Fitzgerald, also both of Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump was referring to the upcoming election.\n\nBut Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents southeast Wisconsin, disputed that Trump made the comment.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" Steil posted on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nAnd Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, said he never heard Trump call Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\"\n\n\"What I heard is to make sure there's election integrity in Milwaukee,\" Tiffany said in a telephone interview. \"He's talking about the states that are in play and the states of greatest importance and Wisconsin is top of the list.\"\n\nA Trump aide and two attorneys who advised him in 2020 were charged with felonies last week in Wisconsin for their roles in a scheme to get Republicans to cast Wisconsin's electoral ballots to Trump even though he lost the state.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Banks, of Indiana, said he was also in the room and \"Trump never disparaged Milwaukee.\"\n\n\"Just another Democrat hoax,\" Banks posted on X.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, when asked about Trump's reported remarks, said at a news conference, \"If Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you buddy.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat who represents and lives in Milwaukee, made a nod to Trump's recent felony convictions in her response. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on July 11, days before the convention opens.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" Moore posted on X.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, said on X that Milwaukee is \"part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation. Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so.\" She used the Trump comment in a fundraising plea hours after it was first reported.\n\nLocal and statewide Democratic leaders, including Gov. Tony Evers, worked with Republicans to land the convention this summer.\n\nEvers, in response to Trump's comment, posted on X: \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about.\" He followed it with an emoji of a clown face.\n\nMilwaukee was supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but that was moved almost entirely online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It is the former president's first visit to the Hill since Jan. 6, when a mob stormed the Capitol to protest his losing the 2020 election.\n\nAt one point, Trump told the Republicans \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" according to Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News.\n\nMilwaukee is set to host the Republican National Convention on July 15, where Trump is expected to be officially named the party's nominee for the 2024 election. The Wisconsin gathering comes just a day after Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in the hush money case where he was convicted of 34 felonies.\n\nTrump's blasting the RNC host city drew a strong reaction on social media.\n\n\"To all of the local elected officials falling over themselves to welcome the GOP to Milwaukee.....you reap what you sow,\" X user Eric Couto wrote.\n\n\"Hey Milwaukee, Trump thinks your city is horrible,\" fellow user @speakout_April noted.\n\n\"Good thing Wisconsin isn't important,\" user Jason Scalese noted. He was referring to Wisconsin being a key battleground state in 2024 with its electoral votes possibly swaying who wins the election.\n\nHowever, there were some who backed the president's comments on the host city.\n\n\"Milwaukee does not feel like a city in its city center. It also is not as charming as Chicago or has a small town feel like Madison,\" X poster @pourz stated.\n\n\"Trump right again,\" poster Julie Viahi simply wrote.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchbowl_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punchbowl News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/13/16/SEI168483961.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650033", "eventUri": "eng-9650033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 425, "textEnd": 431}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 725, "textEnd": 732}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Here's a roundup of some of those responses to Trump's comment and what they indicate about themes in the 2024 presidential election:\n\nSome posts said Trump's comment would encourage Democratic turnout in Milwaukee while preventing on-the-fence voters in the critical swing state from supporting him. Another pointed out that Trump's comment could resonate with some rural voters.\n\nOthers, including Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, pointed out things that make Milwaukee and Wisconsin great, from summer festivals to beer.\n\nWisconsin's House Republicans had conflicting stories about what Trump was talking about, but two said Trump was \"concerned about the election in Milwaukee\" or \"election integrity.\"\n\nTrump in the past has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020. Late returns for President Joe Biden in Milwaukee were because of how Milwaukee counts its absentee ballots, not fraud.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden said Trump was referring to the city's crime rate, while another pointed out Trump's own criminal conviction.\n\nMilwaukee had double-digit percentage drops in homicides (20%), car theft (23%) and property crime (13%) from 2022 to 2023, though those crimes were up compared to 2019.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, crime in Milwaukee dropped 10% from the same time last year, with homicides down 39%, according to Milwaukee police data.\n\nMore: In context: Are these two recent statements about crime in Milwaukee fair and accurate?\n\n\"Well at least he didn't go off on Ho Chi Minh City,\" a Huffington Post reporter tweeted, a reference to a background photo on the RNC's website that showed the city in Vietnam instead of Milwaukee, which was corrected last week.", "source":

In attempting to overturn the results, he and his lawyers argued in lawsuits that more than 200,000 votes should not have been counted, more than 170,000 of which were from Milwaukee and Dane counties. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the claim, upholding Biden's win.\n\nLocations Madison Tags Lee-national Election2024 Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! *

During the meeting, the former president was asked about the city in an important swing state he will need to win as he attempts to return to the White House.\n\n\"In a desperate attempt to get likes, Fake News Jake Sherman, who wasn't even in the room, falsely claimed that President Trump called Milwaukee a 'horrible city.' It's a total lie,\" a campaign press release said. \"President Trump was explicitly referring to the problems in Milwaukee, specifically violent crime and voter fraud.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the word \"horrible\" was used by Trump to talk about Milwaukee. Republicans who were a part of the meeting didn't give a consensus response to whether he did or didn't call Milwaukee \"a horrible city.\" Some suggested it was taken out of context, while others denied the report entirely.\n\nRep. Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI) told WISN-TV in Milwaukee that Trump was referring to election integrity.\n\n\"That's where the comment came from, that Milwaukee's just terrible,\" Fitzgerald said. \"What he was talking about was the elections in Milwaukee, his concerns about them.\"\n\nAnother House Republican, Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), denied it outright.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" Steil posted on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign told the Washington Examiner that Jake Sherman, who reported the information, wasn't in the room and that his claim was wrong. The campaign says the framing of Trump's remarks, that he said, \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" were \"completely false.\"\n\nThe campaign pointed to a question Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) posed about crime and election fraud in Milwaukee and her remark \"he said that those things are horrible. What's happening in that city is horrible.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He didn't just randomly say, 'It's a horrible city.' He was answering a question about the problems that are plaguing the city and described them as horrible.\"\n\nDemocrats used the report to tear into Trump. President Joe Biden's campaign quickly seized the moment by emphasizing they \"think Milwaukee is lovely\" and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson responded to the initial report by saying, \"All of us lived through his presidency, so right back at you, buddy.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_o_keefe@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ross O'Keefe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Tecumseh Sherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WISN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Tenney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Tenney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24165638898987.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650033", "eventUri": "eng-9650033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Period,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe campaign is excited for voters across the country to tune into convention programming and watch the former president accept the nomination, she said.\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Racine next week and, in a little more than a month, be officially named the GOP nominee in Milwaukee.\n\nLeavitt's comments came in response to an NBC News report that preparations are being made both in Milwaukee and at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida home, in case he chooses not to attend or is unable to do so. On the same day, Punchbowl News reported that he referred to Milwaukee as a \"horrible city\" in a meeting with House Republicans.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 after a jury convicted him last week on all 34 felony counts in a case in which prosecutors said he had falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He is expected to appeal.\n\nThe sentencing will come days before the Republican National Convention kicks off at Fiserv Forum. The convention runs July 15-18, with a welcome party the night before it begins.\n\nLast week, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley told reporters in Milwaukee that GOP officials are \"excited\" for the former president to accept the party's nomination in person, but \"if we need to make contingent plans, we will.\"\n\nThe trial galvanized support in the Republican Party, Whatley told reporters, noting a surge in fundraising the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee say followed the verdict.\n\nTrump is the presumptive Republican nominee to take on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in a rematch of the 2020 race.\n\nIn the latest Marquette University Law School poll, Wisconsin voters are split on their November choices for president. Those surveyed by Marquette considered Trump better than Biden at handling immigration and border security, plus the economy, the Israel-Hamas war and foreign relations. Biden had the lead on health care, abortion policy and Medicare and Social Security.\n\nVoters overall ranked the economy as their top issue, with 33% saying it would be most important in deciding who to vote for. Immigration and border security was the second, with 21% citing that issue.\n\nTrump's Thursday comments about Milwaukee came as he discussed campaign strategies, among other GOP priorities, ahead of the 2024 election with House Republicans.\n\nA Trump spokesman characterized the framing as \"total bullshit.\"\n\n\"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as,\" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a post on X. Cheung said the former president was talking about crime and election issues, though members of Wisconsin's delegation didn't agree on which topic Trump was discussing.\n\nRepublican members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation had varying accounts of the comment's context, including one at first who denied it was uttered at all.\n\nTrump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nBiden, for his part, posted on X, \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" with a photo of the president at the 2021 celebration of the Milwaukee Bucks' NBA championship.\n\nThe Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce released a statement praising Milwaukee as \"vibrant\"\n\n\"We look forward to showing the world what Milwaukee has to offer next month. We know this city will impress,\" the organization said.\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley took a similar approach, saying, \"The RNC still chose Milwaukee to come to, right?\"\n\n\"It is my hope that not only our former president but everybody who is going to be embarking on Milwaukee sees everything that we have to offer,\" Crowley said.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType":

They're hardworking people, and it's a great city in a great state.\"\n\nWisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign Manager Garren Randolph piled on, suggesting that Trump should not visit Milwaukee next month for the Republican National Committee's (RNC) convention.\n\n\"If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city. Milwaukee - our state's largest and most diverse city and home to more than 577,000 people, the Bucks and Brewers, and the country's best beer - deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values,\" Randolph said.\n\n\"Donald Trump looks down on Milwaukee, he looks down on Wisconsinites, he looks down on everyone who isn't one of his billionaire donors. But we already knew that - for years, he pushed tax cuts for the top 1% while raising costs for working people and incentivizing companies to ship Wisconsin jobs overseas,\" he continued. \"Voters in Milwaukee are fed up with Donald Trump and extreme MAGA Republicans not caring about them.

Milwaukee's a horrible city. It's hosting a convention celebrating a felon.", "body": "Downtown's Baird Center will play a key RNC role. A $456 million expansion is almost done\n\nDonald Trump paraded his way to Capitol Hill on Thursday and graciously gave congressional Republicans a chance to smooch his felonious posterior. While doing so, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate made the unusual political calculation of insulting the swing-state city that will host next month's Republican National Convention, reportedly calling Milwaukee \"horrible.\"\n\nThis proved, once again, that Trump has zero loyalty and there's no person or thing he won't debase. According to Punchbowl News, the former president said: \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\"\n\nLook, I'm from Chicago, and disliking Milwaukee and Wisconsin at large is a requirement for residency here. The state directly to my north is a region riddled with cheese-obsessed Green Bay Packers fans, and nobody in their right mind wants to go there. (An exception might be carved out for the touristy Wisconsin Dells, assuming you're into water slides and being around lots of people who have regrettable tattoos. But that's it.)\n\nConvicted-felon Donald Trump call Milwaukee 'horrible'? Whatever you say, boss.\n\nStill, even I wouldn't label Milwaukee \"a horrible city.\" It's a nice place with good restaurants and bars and it's right on Lake Michigan, which is beautiful. The only thing I see that's presently making it horrible is the fact that the city has plans next month to host a big political convention celebrating a convicted felon who Republicans think should be president of the United States.\n\nWhy isn't Biden afraid of sharks? How long will feckless Joe Biden ignore the grave threat of sharks and electric boats?\n\nAnd now that convicted felon has taken it upon himself to slam the very city that was nice enough to welcome him and his very weird political party.\n\nThat's definitely horrible.\n\nWisconsin lawmakers rush to defend ... Trump, not Milwaukee\n\nRather than defend the honor of their state's most populous city, GOP lawmakers from Wisconsin tried to make excuses for the words that fell out of Dear Leader's mouth.\n\nRepublican Rep. Derrick Van Orden said Trump was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\"\n\nRepublicans compare Trump to Jesus: Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus. Which Bible is she reading?\n\nGOP Rep. Glenn Grothman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, that Trump \"was concerned about the election in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAnd Republican Rep. Bryan Steil posted on social media: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this.\"\n\nWhich is it, boys? And did each of you get a pat on the head from the MAGA king during Thursday's meeting?\n\nTrump's Milwaukee insult is just a microcosm of his larger loathsomeness\n\nI'll let the good people of Milwaukee - it was hard for me to type \"good,\" but it's actually true - defend their own honor against the always-rude presidential candidate with the 34 felony convictions and the clownish party that has picked him as their avatar.\n\nBut what mattered from Thursday's buffoonery on Capitol Hill wasn't just Trump slagging the city where he will likely become the first-ever convicted felon picked as a major party's presidential candidate. And it wasn't the embarrassingly fawning GOP lawmakers who have traded their backbones for a red MAGA hat and a spot on the wrong side of history.\n\nIt was the whole thing. A twice-impeached, insurrection-fomenting convicted felon who lost the presidency after one-term demanding absolute fealty while showing us all he doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything other than himself.\n\nMaybe steer clear of Milwaukee in July. A felon will be roaming the streets.\n\nRep. Steil did note in his post: \"There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nI'd quibble with that, but one thing is certain. All that will be making Milwaukee \"a horrible city\" in July will be the shameful presence of one Donald J.

It is the largest city in Wisconsin, one of a handful of politically competitive states that is likely to determine the outcome of the Nov. 5 election matchup between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nThe heavily Democratic, majority-minority city is a frequent target of Republican attacks.\n\nThe Biden campaign had swift criticism for the comment.\n\n\"If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city,\" said Biden Wisconsin campaign manager Garren Randolph.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the Republican candidate's statement was described inaccurately. \"He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are,\" Cheung said on social media.\n\nTrump last month reiterated his baseless claims that he won Wisconsin in 2020, though official results show he lost the state to Biden by 21,000 votes and a nonpartisan review found no evidence of fraud.\n\nTrump's Milwaukee comments aren't the first time he's received criticism for remarks made about cities with large Black populations. After the 2020 election, Trump called Detroit and Philadelphia \"two of the most corrupt political places\" in the country. And last year, Trump urged supporters to \"guard the vote\" in cities including Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta -- all Democratic strongholds.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Sullivan and David Morgan,

Tony Evers to respond in a post on X saying, \"Add to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about\" with a clown emoji at the end.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin also responded to the report on X crediting the city for \"making the best beer, brats, and motorcycles in the world\" and continued by saying, \"Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so,\" which is a dig at the former President's conviction in New York for the case involving falsifying business records to pay hush money to former pornstar Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe nature of the comment in question remains unknown, with lawmakers like Wisconsin congressman Bryan Steil, who was in the meeting, saying Trump did not make the comment, while Congressman Glenn Grothman, who was also in the meeting and spoke to Wisconsin Right Now on Thursday, said a comment about Milwaukee was made, but the alleged quote was taken out of context as Trump referring to the RNC doing more to win big northern cities electorally, such as Madison and Milwaukee.\n\nIndiana congressman Jim Banks, another attendee in the meeting, posted on X that \"I was in the meeting. President Trump never disparaged Milwaukee,\" and continued in another post, calling the quote \"just another Democrat hoax.\" The Trump campaign responded to the Punchbowl News story, calling it a \"total lie,\" in a press release on Thursday afternoon, saying, \"President Trump was explicitly referring to the problems in Milwaukee, specifically violent crime and voter fraud.\"\n\nMilwaukee has taken some heat in recent years after Money Inc. named the city in a 2023 study as the 16th most dangerous city in the U.S., which was followed by another study a short time later that used U.S. Census Bureau data to name Milwaukee \"one of the most miserable cities in the country.\" In a quote from the study, the outlet stated, \"Another city filled with an industrial mess, Milwaukee is not pretty. Additionally, the crime rate is pretty high. While some areas remain safer than others, some more dangerous spots of the city are responsible for a crime rate of 1,597 per 100,000 people,\" while also citing the city's high poverty rate of 28.4%.\n\nThe criticism of Milwaukee did not stop there, as Our Health Depot also named Milwaukee the \"ugliest town in Wisconsin,\" giving it the nickname \"Pittsburgh of the Midwest\" due to its industrial background, but the city has seen improvements so far this year, with the Milwaukee Police Department citing data showing homicides are down 39%, robberies have decreased 14%, and auto theft is down 10% from this time last year.", "source": {"uri": "wsau.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSAU News/Talk 550 AM \u00b7 99.9 FM | Wausau, Stevens Point"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Period,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nThe campaign is excited for voters across the country to tune into convention programming and watch the former president accept the nomination, she said.\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Racine, Wisc., next week and, in a little more than a month, be officially named the GOP nominee in Milwaukee.\n\nLeavitt's comments came in response to an NBC News report that preparations are being made both in Milwaukee and at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida home, in case he chooses not to attend or is unable to do so. On the same day, Punchbowl News reported that he referred to Milwaukee as a \"horrible city\" in a meeting with House Republicans.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 after a jury convicted him last week on all 34 felony counts in a case in which prosecutors said he had falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He is expected to appeal.\n\nThe sentencing will come days before the Republican National Convention kicks off at Fiserv Forum. The convention runs July 15-18, with a welcome party the night before it begins.\n\nLast week, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley told reporters in Milwaukee that GOP officials are \"excited\" for the former president to accept the party's nomination in person, but \"if we need to make contingent plans, we will.\"\n\nThe trial galvanized support in the Republican Party, Whatley told reporters, noting a surge in fundraising the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee say followed the verdict.\n\nTrump is the presumptive Republican nominee to take on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in a rematch of the 2020 race.\n\nIn the latest Marquette University Law School poll, Wisconsin voters are split on their November choices for president. Those surveyed by Marquette considered Trump better than Biden at handling immigration and border security, plus the economy, the Israel-Hamas war and foreign relations. Biden had the lead on health care, abortion policy and Medicare and Social Security.\n\nVoters overall ranked the economy as their top issue, with 33% saying it would be most important in deciding who to vote for. Immigration and border security was the second, with 21% citing that issue.\n\nTrump's Thursday comments about Milwaukee came as he discussed campaign strategies, among other GOP priorities, while visiting Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., ahead of the 2024 election with House Republicans.\n\nA Trump spokesman characterized the framing as \"total bullshit.\"\n\n\"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as,\" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a post on X. Cheung said the former president was talking about crime and election issues, though members of Wisconsin's delegation didn't agree on which topic Trump was discussing.\n\nRepublican members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation had varying accounts of the comment's context, including one at first who denied it was uttered at all.\n\nTrump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nBiden, for his part, posted on X, \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" with a photo of the president at the 2021 celebration of the Milwaukee Bucks' NBA championship.\n\nThe Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce released a statement praising Milwaukee as \"vibrant\"\n\n\"We look forward to showing the world what Milwaukee has to offer next month. We know this city will impress,\" the organization said.\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley took a similar approach, saying, \"The RNC still chose Milwaukee to come to, right?\"\n\n\"It is my hope that not only our former president but everybody who is going to be embarking on Milwaukee sees everything that we have to offer,\" Crowley said.\n\nJessie Opoien can be reached at

His sentencing date is July 11, just four days before the Republican convention is set to begin.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers said Trump's comments about the Wisconsin city were taken out of context. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) told reporters Trump was talking about \"election integrity\" in large urban centers, while Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) said he was talking about the city's crime rate, according to the Wisconsin Examiner.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson called the Sherman post \"wrong and \"total bullshit.\"\n\n\"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as,\" Steven Cheung replied on X. \"He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign also sent out an email calling the reporting \"FAKE NEWS.\"\n\nAnd even Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who has embraced the Republican convention due to the economic boom it will bring to the city, pushed back on Trump's reported remark.\n\n\"Donald Trump was talking about things that are horrible,\" the Democratic mayor said when he addressed Trump's remarks in an unrelated press conference Thursday. \"All of us lived through his presidency.

President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July,\" Rep. Bryan Steil, whose district includes Milwaukee County, posted on X.\n\n\"Another classic example of sh-ty reporting by a Democratic Party shill pretending to be a journalist,\" added Rep. Derrick Van Orden. \"Lies busy [sic] omission.\"\n\nVan Orden, one of six Republicans to represent the Badger State in the House and Senate, said the former president had been discussing Milwaukee having the third-highest violent crime rate of any US city.\n\nRep. Glenn Grothman, who represents some of Milwaukee's suburbs, told the hometown Journal Sentinel newspaper that Trump was making an election-related comment because he \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\"\n\nStaten Island Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) told The Post that the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee was discussing \"Democratic policies\" and \"ballot security\" -- and in that context had expressed concerns about Milwaukee.\n\nTrump, 77, also expressed similar worries about the critical swing states of Pennsylvania and Georgia, she added.\n\n\"I was in the meeting. President Trump never disparaged Milwaukee,\" Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) also posted on X. \"Just another Democrat hoax.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee was quick to comment on the remark to highlight Trump's electoral loss in Wisconsin to Joe Biden in the last presidential election.\n\n\"The dislike is mutual -- in 2020, Milwaukee County went for President Biden by around 40 points, helping to flip the state blue and send Joe Biden to the White House,\" the DNC said in a statement to CBS 58 News.\n\nTrump may also be barred from attending the convention should his upcoming sentence for his Manhattan hush money conviction include prison time or home confinement.\n\nThe 45th president is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 after being found guilty of 34 counts of business fraud for concealing evidence of \"hush money\" payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election in order to buy her silence about a decade-old alleged extramarital affair.\n\nIf Judge Juan Merchan places Trump on house arrest at his Fifth Avenue triplex -- or sends him to Rikers Island -- it is possible that the ex-president would still be able to campaign or attend the convention remotely.\n\nOne former Republican National Committee official told The Post last week: \"My suspicion of, what you do if the guy is actually in jail -- which, who knows, right? -- I think you probably have him do some kind of video in advance just in case.\"\n\nCampaign insiders also noted that the former president does not have to be physically present to accept the GOP nod for what will be the third consecutive time.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\n\"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, wrote on X, quoting PunchBowl reporter Jake Sherman's initial tweet. \"There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nSteil later told a local TV station that Trump \"wasn't talking about the city, he was talking about specific issues in the city.\"\n\n\"We were having broad conversation about the challenges we face in as a country, in particular the challenges we've seen in Milwaukee,\" Steil said mentioning issues with elections, crime, and public schools.\n\nA spokesperson for Steil later told Business Insider that since no one was taking notes, it was not clear whether or not Trump said \"Milwaukee\" and \"horrible\" next to each other.\n\n\"He's not saying Milwaukee itself is horrible,\" the spokesperson said. \"He was saying the crime and election integrity that the city is facing is what's horrible.\"\n\nA convention spokesperson told a local TV station that Trump was discussing his concerns about the security perimeter for the convention, which has been the subject of GOP frustration related to whether protests can occur in a park close to the main convention arena.\n\nBoth parties have historically hosted their conventions in cities or states that may have different politics than their own. This is especially true for Republicans, who have hosted their conventions in cities like New York. Local officials are known for playing nice though in order to garner the big business and spotlight that comes with hosting one of the two major political parties as they formally nominate their presidential candidate.\n\nTrump's reported insult quickly landed back in Wisconsin where local reporters jumped on the story. The former president's campaign disputed the report.\n\n\"Wrong. Total bullshit,\" spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote on X, quoting Sherman's initial tweet. \"He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as. He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\n\nSherman has stood by his reporting. \"Trump absolutely said it - undoubtedly,\" he wrote later on X. \"People hear what they want. This is familiar to all who have covered Trump or Trump-adjacent stories for the last 10 or so years.\"\n\nDemocrats and the Biden campaign were quick to defend the largest city in a key swing state.

I've had all I can stands, and I can't stands no more. From the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel:\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday called Milwaukee, where he will be declared the Republican nominee for president this summer, a \"horrible city.\"\n\nTrump made the comment to House Republicans in a morning meeting on Capitol Hill to discuss campaign strategies, among other GOP priorities, ahead of the 2024 election. His remarks came five days before he is scheduled to visit Racine for a campaign rally.\n\n\"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" Trump told the GOP lawmakers, according to a report from Punchbowl News that a spokesman for Trump characterized as \"Total bullshit.\"\n\nTalk about the man who came to dinner.\n\nThis put Wisconsin Republicans in a terrible bind. The state's GOP love to run thinly veiled racist ads against Milwaukee, but this is a national deal, and the state's Republican congressional delegation was thrown into a conniption fit.\n\nU.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman of the Sixth Congressional District and U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of the Fifth Congressional District, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Trump made the comments when speaking about the upcoming election. Grothman said Trump \"was concerned about the election in Milwaukee\" and said he thought Trump \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\" He suggested Trump had concerns that Republicans \"didn't do very well in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAn aide to Fitzgerald also told the Journal Sentinel Trump's comments \"were about election integrity.\"...\n\nU.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Republican who represents Wisconsin's Third Congressional District in western Wisconsin, blasted Punchbowl's reporting, however, saying in a post on the social media platform X that the former president was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\" And Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents the state's First Congressional District, said \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, Trump said it, but he was talking about voter fraud. Or, Trump said it but he was talking about the crime rate. Or, finally, Trump didn't say it at all, and Milwaukee is great in July. Which it is, even though most of Summerfest has been bumped back to June. (You do get a week of it in July, and I know nothing about any of the main stage performers, so you're on your own.) But you don't get to bad-mouth the 'Wauk to me. It is a city with problems, at least some of which are due to a heavily gerrymandered Republican legislature that likes to use it as a convenient punching bag, especially at election time.\n\nIt was crippled by deindustrialization in the years since I left. When I first arrived, Allis-Chalmers, Allen Bradley, Harley Davidson, and International Harvester all were thriving, and that's not to mention the four independent breweries dating back in several cases to the mid-19th Century. The Harley company is still there, but Allis-Chalmers doesn't exist anymore. International Harvester moved to non-union Kentucky. As for the breweries, Pabst is headquartered in Texas now. Schlitz sold out, first to Stroh's and then to Pabst. Miller is owned by Molson/Coors. Blatz is produced by Miller under a contract with Pabst. Its lovely old headquarters building now houses condominiums. The city is battered and bruised but it still doesn't deserve the contempt of a convicted felon.\n\nI did a lot of my growing up there, and I met people whose impact on my life I can feel to this day. Next year is my 50th college reunion. My college campus has grown up a lot. Downtown, the city is now on its third mega-arena. (Still no NHL franchise.) And Milwaukee is a place where the Wisconsin Idea as promulgated by Senator Bob LaFollette and some other smart people in Madison still lives, despite all the Bradleys, and Uihleins, and Johnsons, and Walkers, and Grothmans, and Van Ordens who have tried to squash it out forever. If the city makes El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago nervous, he can stay down in his decaying Xanadu by the rising sea. He probably can't leave the state anyway.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All of us lived through his presidency. So, right back at you, buddy,\" Johnson said. \"Donald Trump once again is wrong about something. That shouldn't be new news, especially for somebody who has a proven track record of lying about a number of things.\"\n\nJohnson said about 50,000 Republicans call the deep blue city home. The Democratic mayor has welcomed the Republican National Convention while also vocally backing Democratic President Joe Biden's bid for a second term in the White House.\n\nTrump is expected to accept the party's nomination at the RNC to take on Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Wisconsin, a key swing state, is expected to again play a crucial role in the election's outcome.\n\n\"I find it kind of strange that he would insult the largest city in Wisconsin because he's running for president,\" Johnson said. \"To insult the state that's hosting your convention, I think it's kind of bizarre.\"\n\nMore: Here's how social media is reacting to Trump's 'horrible city' comment about Milwaukee\n\nTrump, who is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in neaarby Racine on Tuesday, made the comment Thursday morning to House Republicans in a meeting on Capitol Hill to discuss campaign strategies. Republican members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation offered varying accounts of the comment's context. Three said he was referencing the upcoming election while another said Trump had been talking about crime in the city.\n\nDespite its challenges, Johnson said the crime rate in Milwaukee is dropping and he will continue investing in public safety.\n\n\"I'm aware that in urban areas there are challenges,\" Johnson said. \"And these urban challenges are not unique to Milwaukee. They exist in cities all across the United States.\"\n\nDespite the comment, Johnson said he remains confident Milwaukee's image will be unharmed.\n\nCity leaders have billed the Republican National Convention as an opportunity for Milwaukee to make a name for itself on the national stage. About 50,000 people, including thousands of members of the media from across the nation and globe, are expected to visit the city during the July 15-18 convention.\n\n\"I don't think this changes anything or people's perceptions about Milwaukee,\" Johnson said.\n\nTrump's comment left Johnson with one piece of advice for local voters:\n\n\"For us for voters here in Milwaukee, I think the message is pretty clear. You've heard from the man himself. Let's all work to make sure that he doesn't have the opportunity to live in another city that I think he probably thinks is horrible, too,\" Johnson said. \"And that's Washington, D.C.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racine, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Racine, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/16/PMJS/73720559007-240516-news-vp-p-3.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4608,2594,x3,y275&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650033", "eventUri": "eng-9650033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "dateEnd": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 2294, "textEnd": 2304}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 766, "textEnd": 772}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee's a horrible city. It's hosting a convention celebrating a felon.", "body": "Donald Trump paraded his way to Capitol Hill on Thursday and graciously gave congressional Republicans a chance to smooch his felonious posterior. While doing so, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate made the unusual political calculation of insulting the swing-state city that will host next month's Republican National Convention, reportedly calling Milwaukee \"horrible.\"\n\nThis proved, once again, that Trump has zero loyalty and there's no person or thing he won't debase. According to Punchbowl News, the former president said: \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\"\n\nLook, I'm from Chicago, and disliking Milwaukee and Wisconsin at large is a requirement for residency here. The state directly to my north is a region riddled with cheese-obsessed Green Bay Packers fans, and nobody in their right mind wants to go there. (An exception might be carved out for the touristy Wisconsin Dells, assuming you're into water slides and being around lots of people who have regrettable tattoos. But that's it.)\n\nStill, even I wouldn't label Milwaukee \"a horrible city.\" It's a nice place with good restaurants and bars and it's right on Lake Michigan, which is beautiful. The only thing I see that's presently making it horrible is the fact that the city has plans next month to host a big political convention celebrating a convicted felon who Republicans think should be president of the United States.\n\nWhy isn't Biden afraid of sharks? How long will feckless Joe Biden ignore the grave threat of sharks and electric boats?\n\nAnd now that convicted felon has taken it upon himself to slam the very city that was nice enough to welcome him and his very weird political party.\n\nThat's definitely horrible.\n\nRather than defend the honor of their state's most populous city, GOP lawmakers from Wisconsin tried to make excuses for the words that fell out of Dear Leader's mouth.\n\nRepublican Rep. Derrick Van Orden said Trump was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\"\n\nRepublicans compare Trump to Jesus: Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus. Which Bible is she reading?\n\nGOP Rep. Glenn Grothman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, that Trump \"was concerned about the election in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAnd Republican Rep. Bryan Steil posted on social media: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this.\"\n\nWhich is it, boys? And did each of you get a pat on the head from the MAGA king during Thursday's meeting?\n\nI'll let the good people of Milwaukee - it was hard for me to type \"good,\" but it's actually true - defend their own honor against the always-rude presidential candidate with the 34 felony convictions and the clownish party that has picked him as their avatar.\n\nBut what mattered from Thursday's buffoonery on Capitol Hill wasn't just Trump slagging the city where he will likely become the first-ever convicted felon picked as a major party's presidential candidate. And it wasn't the embarrassingly fawning GOP lawmakers who have traded their backbones for a red MAGA hat and a spot on the wrong side of history.\n\nIt was the whole thing. A twice-impeached, insurrection-fomenting convicted felon who lost the presidency after one-term demanding absolute fealty while showing us all he doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything other than himself.\n\nRep. Steil did note in his post: \"There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nI'd quibble with that, but one thing is certain. All that will be making Milwaukee \"a horrible city\" in July will be the shameful presence of one Donald J. Trump.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Van_Orden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Van Orden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Dells,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Grothman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Grothman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rl1dr8dzdrGvF.9wk7QLnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_opinion_532/6226961c4928854b3d3ecd690986e700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650033", "eventUri": "eng-9650033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That's why the Republican National Convention this year is in Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin -- a state that Trump narrowly lost in 2020, and which is a must-win for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign. Now that the RNC has fixed its website to feature a picture of Milwaukee rather than Ho Chi Minh City, the former president has his own words of praise.\n\n\"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" he said during a closed-door meeting with Republican members of Congress today, according to Axios and Punchbowl News.\n\nAs we near the nine-year mark of the Trump era of American politics, the game of \"imagine if Barack Obama had done it\" or even \"imagine if Mitt Romney had done it\" can feel tired. And yet it's still worth playing. Really: Imagine if Obama had trashed the major city of the crucial swing state that was hosting his party's convention! This is a politician who was tarred as an out-of-touch elitist for his mere mention of arugula at Whole Foods. The next cycle, his campaign was so desperate to seem sympathetic to authentic local culture that Michelle Obama praised the \"great barbecue\" in Charlotte, North Carolina, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, puzzling even the city's mayor. (\"I have had great barbecue in Charlotte that's been brought in on a truck,\" he said, alluding to the fact that the state's famous smoked pork is not typically associated with his relatively bland city.)\n\nRead: A war on blue America\n\nTrump's disdain for American cities is one of his most consistent personality traits. His aspersions on Milwaukee were cast from Washington, D.C., another city for which he has little use. \"It was also very sad driving through Washington, D.C., and seeing the filth and the decay and all of the broken buildings and walls and the graffiti,\" he said last year after a trip to the capital to plead not guilty to federal charges related to his attempt to steal the 2020 election. He also called the city a \"filthy and crime ridden embarrassment to our nation,\" which is funny from someone accused of committing crimes there. Lately he has been complaining about his own home town, following his felony conviction in New York City in May.\n\nSome Trump allies have denied the reports that he disparaged Milwaukee. Glenn Grothman and Scott Fitzgerald, both Republican congressmen from Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump's comment reflected his concerns about election integrity in 2020. Their colleague Derrick van Orden, meanwhile, posted on X that Trump was specifically talking about \"the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\" And yet another Wisconsin Republican, Bryan Steil, suggested that there was no comment at all. \"I was in the room,\" he tweeted. \"President Trump did not say this.\"\n\nThese guys might have benefited from taking a minute to get their story straight, especially given what we already know about Trump. Pick a major city and there's a good chance you can find him denigrating it. \"We can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening,\" he said in 2019. The following year he added: \"Look what's happened to San Francisco, so sad what's happened when you see a slum. It's worse than a slum, there's no slum like that. What they've done to San Francisco is a crying shame.\" (That hasn't stopped him from co-owning a property in town or raising a pile of campaign cash there last week.) Baltimore: a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\" Atlanta: \"in horrible shape and falling apart (and not to mention crime infested).\" Philadelphia: \"Bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things.\"\n\nRead: Red state, blue city\n\nYou don't have to look too hard to see a couple common threads here: These cities are all overwhelmingly Democratic, and most of them are heavily Black. Washington gave Trump just 5.4 percent of its vote in 2020, though that was up from 4 percent in 2016. Huge numbers of Democratic votes in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, big Black population centers, helped Biden win Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia in 2020. (He continues to insist this was only because of fraud, as Fitzgerald and Grothman suggested, but no evidence exists for fraud that would have affected the result.)\n\nThat's part of Trump's game here. Insulting a town like Milwaukee won't help him inside the city limits, but he wasn't going to win many votes there anyway. Blue cities are often in tension with more conservative areas of their home states. By attacking these urban centers as hellholes, he might gin up anger among white suburban, exurban, and rural voters outside of them, and use that to make up his margin. It's a microcosm of his broader political strategy, which is less to win over swing voters than to run up margins with his base.\n\nBut the president is, at least in theory, a president for all Americans, not just the ones who elected him. These attacks on the urban areas where most people in the United States live are a warning about how he would govern in his second term. (In short: Much like the first, only more so.) Elsewhere, Trump has been pretty scathing about the nation as a whole, as Ed Kilgore pointed out last year.\n\n\"We are a failing nation,\" he said last year. \"We are a nation that lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. We are a nation that has lost its way.\" One starts to wonder why he wants to lead it -- and whether he even likes it much in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_a_graham@theatlantic.com", "name": "David A.

However, in 2024 he seems to have changed his mind post felony convictions and he is now attempting to get his voters to do so any way, any how. Veuer's Tony Spitz has the details.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called Milwaukee \"a horrible city\" in a meeting with House Republicans Thursday, just one month before the city is to host the Republican National Convention, according to a Washington political news site.\n\n\"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" Trump said, according to Punchbowl News' Jake Sherman.\n\nTrump made the comment on Capitol Hill during a meeting to discuss campaign strategy and other issues ahead of the November election.\n\nThe former president, who's slated to be in Racine next week, is the party's presumptive nominee, a title that will be bestowed at the convention next month.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Gwen Moore, of Milwaukee, in a post on X, ripped Trump while trolling him over his recent felony convictions.\n\n\"Once he's settled in with his parole officer, I am certain he will discover that Milwaukee is a wonderful, vibrant and welcoming city full of diverse neighborhoods and a thriving business community,\" she posted.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-town of Vermont, in a text to the Wisconsin State Journal said Trump is showing his true colors.\n\n\"Well at least we know what he thinks about us,\" he wrote. \"It's hard to support a guy who hates our state.\"\n\nRepublican Wisconsin representatives sought to downplay the remarks or said Trump was misquoted.\n\n\"I was in the room,\" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Racine, wrote in a post on X. \"President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\n\nAlso posting on X, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Prairie du Chien, said some of what Trump said was omitted.\n\n\"@realDonaldTrump was specifically referring to the crime the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee,\" he posted.\n\nU.S. Reps. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, and Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump's comments were specifically about \"election integrity\" issues in Wisconsin's most populous city.\n\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential vote in Wisconsin to Joe Biden but continues to make baseless claims that he actually won the state. In attempting to overturn the results, he and his lawyers argued in lawsuits that more than 200,000 votes should not have been counted, more than 170,000 of which were from Milwaukee and Dane counties. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the claim, upholding Biden's win.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocations Madison Tags Lee-national Donald Trump 2016 Republican National Convention

In attempting to overturn the results, he and his lawyers argued in lawsuits that more than 200,000 votes should not have been counted, more than 170,000 of which were from Milwaukee and Dane counties. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the claim, upholding Biden's win.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocations Madison Tags Lee-national Election2024 Be the first to know\n\nGet

But it was his comment about his convention's host city that seemed to spark the most furious response.\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/13/trump-milwaukee-horrible-wisconsin-democrats-00163243", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Evers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Evers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Wisconsin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Genres/Science Fiction and Fantasy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Play Groups", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650033", "eventUri": "eng-9650033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee is very often criticized by the rural and suburban politicians in the rest of the state, who use racist dog whistles, yell \"socialism,\" or rely on more overt bigotry. Myths of rampant crime continue to plague the city, even as its crime rate has dropped.

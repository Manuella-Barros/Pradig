(Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nA human in Michigan tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, authorities announced on May 22.\n\nThe farmworker, whose name, gender, age, and other personal details were not disclosed, experienced mild symptoms and has already recovered, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nThe location and name of the farm that employs the worker were also not identified.\n\nA nasal swab from the patient tested negative but an eye swab tested positive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\n\nKnown symptoms of H5N1 include eye inflammation and fatigue.\n\nThe patient only reported eye symptoms, according to the agency.\n\nThe influenza, known as the bird flu and H5N1, has previously been detected in 15 dairy cattle herds and multiple poultry flocks in Michigan. Officials have been asking workers exposed to sick animals to take tests and report even mild symptoms.\n\n\"The current health risk to the general public remains low,\" Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive of the department, said in a statement. \"This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.\"\n\nThe CDC said that the new infection \"does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\"\n\n\"However, this development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals,\" it added.\n\nPeople who get close to infected cattle or other animals are advised to wear protective equipment like goggles. All people are advised to avoid eating raw or undercooked food from animals with suspected or confirmed cases.\n\nEye infections could result from instances such as being splashed with contaminated fluid or touching one's eye with a contaminated hand, officials said.\n\nHigh levels of H5N1 have been found in unpasteurized milk. Some samples of pasteurized milk tested positive for H5N1, but further testing showed no live virus in those samples, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said.\n\n\"Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nDr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious diseases doctor, said on the social media platform X that the second case \"means that farm workers are at risk ... and more may be getting sick than we know, may continue to get sick, and should be protected.\"\n\nShe added: \"Other humans with close contact with infected animals should be protected. And we need to reduce those infections so virus doesn't mutate further to become a threat that transmits between humans efficiently.\"\n\nThe bird flu is believed to have jumped from birds to cattle in the United States in late 2023. Since then, just one human case had been identified before the Michigan case. That farmworker in Texas has also since recovered, according to government officials.\n\nAnother person contracted the bird flu in 2022, in Colorado, and survived.\n\nFrom 2003 through April 1, the World Health Organization has received reports from 23 countries of a total of 889 H5N1 cases in humans. About half of those patients died.\n\nAdditional cases with mild or no symptoms are likely to have occurred, scientists say.\n\nAs of May 21, cases in 51 herds across nine states have been confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of May 20, nearly 91 million poultry have been infected with the bird flu across 48 states, according to the CDC.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 24 announced an order mandating testing for influenza A before moving dairy cattle across state lines. Michigan authorities on May 1 issued an emergency order that laid out a number of new measures aimed at combating spread of the bird flu, including barring the exhibition of lactating dairy cattle. President Joe Biden's administration on May 10 announced the commitment of nearly $200 million to stem the spread of the avian influenza, including compensating dairy farmers for the loss of milk production from infected cattle.\n\nIn Australia this week, the Victoria Department of Health announced the first case of H5N1 in a child who was on a trip overseas and returned to Australia in March.\n\nThe child experienced severe symptoms but has recovered, authorities said.\n\nThe case was the first in a person or animal in Australia.\n\nAvian influenza was also confirmed in poultry at an egg farm near Meredith, but testing showed it was caused by the H7 strain of avian influenza, not H5.\n\nU.S. authorities say the milk, beef, and egg supply is safe, citing tests the government has performed. Australian authorities said that egg and poultry products \"are safe to consume.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Have any people in the U.S. gotten sick with it? I heard on the news that it has moved into cows. Does that mean you can get it from drinking milk?\n\nDear Reader: Bird flu, also referred to as avian influenza, is a type A influenza virus. It is also known as H5N1, a designation that refers to the specific combination of two groups of proteins that identify various subtypes of the virus.\n\nBird flu is widespread in wild birds, and in that population, which has developed immunity, it usually results in few symptoms. However, when transmitted to domesticated poultry, it's lethal. In the U.S., bird flu has caused outbreaks in poultry in 48 states. It has also infected other animals, including dairy cows.\n\nH5N1 infection in humans has been extremely rare. When the virus does move from an animal to a human, the resulting illness can range from causing no symptoms or very mild symptoms to severe disease that can be fatal. Transmission of the virus is via close contact with an infected animal, or with their saliva, mucus or feces. There has been no known person-to-person transmission of the H5N1 virus.\n\nAt this time, there have been two confirmed cases in the U.S. of transmission of the H5N1 virus from an animal to a human. One occurred in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022. His symptoms were limited to fatigue. The most recent case affected a farm worker in Texas, whose primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. Both individuals were successfully treated with antiviral medications. It's the more recent infection, which occurred on a dairy farm earlier this spring, that brings us to your question about bird flu and cows.\n\nBoth the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are actively monitoring the presence of avian influenza in cows. The latest information confirms outbreaks in 34 dairy herds in nine states. Testing for H5N1 virus in milk samples has found the presence of viral particles. However, the process of pasteurization, in which milk is heated to high temperatures to kill other types of pathogens, is effective at killing the influenza virus, as well. As a result, pasteurized milk and milk products do not present a danger. The FDA has also announced that it is collecting and testing samples of ground beef offered for sale in states with outbreaks of bird flu in dairy cows. Lactating dairy cows are also now required to test negative for H5N1 virus before crossing state lines.\n\nFor most people, the overall risk of contracting bird flu is extremely low. The CDC and the World Health Organization say that those at greatest risk are farm workers and others who have regular and prolonged contact with poultry and dairy cattle. The Department of Agriculture has also begun to use a so-called virus surrogate to conduct tests on cooking times to determine the temperature to which meat must be heated in order to kill the H5N1 virus. The agency says it plans to release that data as it becomes available.\n\nSend your questions to askthedoctors@mednet.ucla.edu.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saliva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/iGYYzE_MHHRgT9FpbzQTb2t8Hws=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/15/5eea9cacabbf2.image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Like the infected person in Texas, the Michigan patient only reported eye symptoms. He has recovered, according to officials.\n\nOfficials said in a press conference Wednesday they were investigating the case to determine whether the worker was wearing personal protective equipment and how exactly the person might have gotten sickened by a cow presumed to be infected.\n\nOfficials said the risk to the public from bird flu remains low but the risk to farmworkers is \"elevated\" as a growing number of cattle are infected with bird flu.\n\nIn March, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with bird flu. That was the first documented case of the flu spreading from a cow to a human.\n\nEarlier this week, the CDC's principal deputy director, Dr. Nirav D. Shah asked state health officials around the country to continue monitoring for flu \"at enhanced levels\" throughout the summer to help catch bird flu cases in humans.\n\nFlu monitoring usually falls or stops during the summer months when temperatures rise and the spread of flu viruses falls to minimal levels in the United States. In Georgia, the Department of Public Health closely tracks flu activity from October through mid-May and scales back its monitoring during the summer months.\n\nBut in a meeting with state health officials, CDC officials said they want local health departments across the country to maintain a heightened awareness of circulating influenza viruses given the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 among poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.\n\nShah asked state health officials to maintain their peak-season levels to help detect \"even rare\" cases of bird flu in humans.\n\nThe bird flu now affecting dairy herds is an H5N1 virus, which is a subtype of influenza A, a common version of the flu infecting mostly people.\n\nStandard testing cannot distinguish human influenza A viruses (such as H1N1) from bird flu (H5N1). A special process in the lab is required to determine whether the influenza sample is a common seasonal influenza virus or the more worrisome H5N1.\n\nShah said the request from the federal agency wants state health officials to increase influenza samples analyzed in labs to help catch any human cases of H5N1.\n\nDPH spokeswoman Nancy Nydam told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Wednesday that in accordance with this new guidance from the CDC, the health department will maintain a high level of surveillance this summer and commercial labs in Georgia will now be asked to submit influenza A-positive specimens to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for what is known as \"subtyping\" -- a process to determine if the influenza A sample is a common virus or the bird flu strain.\n\nIt is rare for humans to get bird flu and currently, most cases of bird flu in people around the globe are linked to direct contact with infected animals. H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and has caused outbreaks in poultry and recently made the jump to dairy cows.\n\nScientists are paying close attention to how the virus is changing and are on high alert for any changes in the bird flu virus that might enable it to spread more easily among people.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the H5N1 virus has been detected in 51 dairy herds in nine states since March.\n\nGeorgia, however, has not reported any cases in cattle, or in humans.\n\nJust how much the increased surveillance will help remains to be seen. The CDC is on high alert for any uptick in activity this summer. And while Georgia DPH monitors flu activity by watching the percent of doctors' visits that are for \"influenza-like illness,\" like other states, they don't track each positive influenza case.\n\nAnd many people with flu-like symptoms don't get tested.\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

All people are advised to avoid eating raw or undercooked food from animals with suspected or confirmed cases.\n\nEye infections could result from instances such as being splashed with contaminated fluid or touching one's eye with a contaminated hand, officials said.\n\nHigh levels of H5N1 have been found in unpasteurized milk. Some samples of pasteurized milk tested positive for H5N1, but further testing showed no live virus in those samples, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said.\n\n\"Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nThe bird flu is believed to have jumped from birds to cattle in the United States in late 2023.

The child developed a \"severe infection\" but has since made a full recovery.\n\nThe recent human case in Australia was also caused by a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1, but not the same one causing the outbreak in the U.S., Victorian authorities said.\n\nNo known human-to-human spread has occurred with the current H5N1 strains, per the CDC. The risk to the general public is low, but the outbreak has sounded the alarm among health officials in the U.S. and abroad, who are monitoring bird flu viruses closely.\n\nOccasionally, bird flu viruses spread to mammals, and rarely, to humans.\n\nIn a recent press conference, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans \"an enormous concern,\" and warned about the potential for the virus to acquire the ability to spread more efficiently between people.\n\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 strain causing the U.S. outbreak is severe and often fatal in birds, but appears to be mild in cows. However, traces of the virus have been detected in milk.\n\nBird flu infections in humans can range in severity, experts note. Some people have no symptoms at all or only a mild flu-like illness, while others develop severe disease requiring hospitalization, according to the CDC.\n\n\"It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,\" said Schaffner.\n\nAccording to the CDC, reported signs and symptoms of bird flu include:\n\nBird flu in humans may look similar to seasonal influenza flu or upper respiratory infection. In severe cases, bird flu can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications, TODAY.com previously reported.\n\nThe recent case of H5N1 in the child in Australia was a severe infection, but the child fully recovered. Victorian health officials did not release additional details about the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe dairy worker in Texas who tested positive for H5N1 in March had a mild infection, with eye redness or conjunctivitis (pink eye) as the only symptom, the CDC said. The patient was treated with flu antivirals and recovered.\n\nThe only other human case of H5N1 in the U.S., which was reported in Colorado in 2022. was a mild infection as well.\n\nAn infection with bird flu viruses cannot be diagnosed by signs or symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.\n\nTransmission of bird flu viruses to humans is very rare. According to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries.\n\nAvian influenza can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, per the CDC:\n\nInfected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces, TODAY.com previously reported. People can become infected when the virus particles get into the mouth, nose, eyes or are inhaled, says Schaffner.\n\nHumans typically become infected with bird flu viruses through close, unprotected contact with an infected bird.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of bird flu viruses is extremely rare. The few cases that have been documented have occurred primarily through prolonged, unprotected contact between a symptomatic person and a family member or caregiver, per the CDC.\n\n\"The virus doesn't have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,\" says Schaffner. However, scientists are closely monitoring bird flu viruses for any changes.\n\nThere is no evidence that humans can get bird flu from chicken, eggs, or beef that's been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to drink pasteurized milk, experts say.\n\nThe risk of getting bird flu is low, but the CDC recommends people:", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza-like illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/bird-flu-cz-240522-78835e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The worker experienced conjunctivitis (an eye infection) but no other symptoms.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stressed that the risk to the public remains low.\n\nThe H5N1 subvariant of bird flu has been increasingly reported in cattle in recent months, with 52 cases reported in nine states since March 25.\n\nLast month, a person who had exposure to infected cows in Texas was found to be infected with the H5N1 subtype, with conjunctivitis being their only symptom. The infected person was treated with a flu antiviral drug and recovered.\n\nHealth officials have expressed concerns that there may be more farm workers infected who aren't getting tested.\n\nDr. Barb Petersen, a dairy veterinarian in Amarillo, Texas, told NBC earlier this month that several dairy workers had fallen ill with \"classic flu-like symptoms,\" including high fever, sweating at night, chills, lower back pain, upset stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea. They also suffered from conjunctivitis. These workers were not tested for H5N1 so it remains unclear if they were infected with the bird flu or another illness.\n\nPetersen told Fortune as well that she \"had people who never missed work, miss work\" on affected farms due to illness.\n\nGregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, told NPR earlier this month that he suspects there are at least several cases of farm workers being infected with the virus, as some workers sought medical care for \"influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis\" at the same time that H5N1 was spreading on the dairy farms.\n\nBird flu spreads in cats, Australia reports human case\n\nAdditionally, four cases of H5N1 bird flu were reported in cats in South Dakota and Michigan recently, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The two cases in South Dakota involved cats that had no known contact with poultry or dairy cattle. The two cases in Michigan were in contact with dairy cows.\n\nOn Wednesday, Australia reported its first human case of H5N1 bird flu in a child who returned to Australia from India in March. The child experienced severe illness but fully recovered. The child was infected in India and the strain of H5N1 flu that the child was infected with was not the same as the one circulating in the US, according to the Victoria Department of Health.\n\nAdditionally, on Wednesday, an outbreak of H7N7 bird flu was found on an egg farm near Meredith in the state of Victoria in Australia. The affected farm has been placed under quarantine. Australia experienced an outbreak of H7N7 bird flu from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAustralia is the only continent that has not experienced outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in the worldwide spread of the virus that began in 2021.\n\nSince 2021, Europe and the Americas have been suffering from a nearly continuous outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, which has been described as \"the largest-ever\" on the three continents. The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals worldwide. Outbreaks of the virus have also become more common in Africa and Asia in the past year and have even spread to Antarctica in recent months.\n\nThe World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) noted in March that, while estimates vary, about 485 bird species and 37 mammal species have been infected with avian influenza since 2021. Only the Pacific Islands, Australia, and New Zealand have been spared from the virus.\n\n\"The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis,\" noted WOAH.\n\nSign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >>", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [],

-- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday reported a second and similar case of the bird flu identified this time in Michigan tied to cows amid an outbreak beginning on a Texas dairy farm.\n\nDespite this, the CDC's risk public assessment for the general population \"remains low\" but the organization says this new case underscores \"the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals,\" which it said include people with long or unprotected exposure to infected birds, livestock and other animals, or in that type of environment.\n\nThe agency said similar to the Texas case -- first U.S. human bird flu case linked to an outbreak in dairy cows and the first likely case of human infection from a cow globally -- the Michigan individual is a dairy farm worker where the virus had been identified in cows, and that while a nasal swab test originally tested negative for influenza, an eye swab test sent to the CDC identified it as bird flu, which they say indicates eye infections in both cases with only reported eye symptoms in the patients.\n\nThe CDC says they have been eyeing influenza surveillance systems closely, \"particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance.\" The Michigan dairy worker who was being monitored because of their work exposure to H5N1-infected cattle reported symptoms to local health officials, they said.\n\nConjunctivitis, better known as an eye infection, has been associated with previous human infections with avian influenza A viruses and is part of the current CDC case definition for A(H5N1) surveillance, according to the CDC, which added that while it's not yet known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures, \"it may be from eye contamination, potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eyes with something contaminated with the virus, such as a hand.\"\n\nHigh levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows, the federal agency said.\n\n\"Given the high levels of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said, adding that \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public,\" which they consider\n\nA Texas poultry facility in April stopped production and was ordered to cull 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets -- or young female chickens -- at a facility near New Mexico's border due to the virus' rapid spread.\n\nLast year, scientists and researchers began sounding the alarm on dangerous changes to the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza from seasonal to year-round infections, saying at the time that an urgent coordinated national response was needed.\n\nBut the Centers for Disease Control says it has been taking steps to mitigate any future bird flu cases such as by holding weekly engagements with state and local health officials \"around increasing their preparedness posture, updated interim recommendations for worker protection to include those who work with dairy cows,\" health alerts and several other steps.\n\nEarlier this month, the federal government announced a series of new initiatives aimed to monitor and prevent the bird flu as it got reported days later how the H5N1 avian flu virus was discovered in a small number of wild New York City birds.", "source":

Of the 800 cases reported since the late 1990s, roughly 50 per cent resulted in death.\n\nThe virus has recently broken out among dairy cattle in the US in an unprecedented outbreak.\n\nSo far, 51 herds in nine US states have been affected, although experts think it is far more widespread.\n\nThe apparent ability of the virus to spread between cows is significant because it provides more opportunities for it to evolve to better infect and spread between other mammals.\n\nOf particular concern is whether H5N1 might now be able to infect pigs, often described as 'mixing vessels' for influenza and making it more likely that the virus could adapt to spread between humans.\n\nSo far this year, there have been two other confirmed human cases of H5N1.\n\nIn Vietnam, a man died in March after direct contact with an infected bird, whilst in Texas a farm worker caught the virus from sick cattle - although his symptoms were mild.\n\nThe US Centre for Disease Control is monitoring a further 300 people who have been exposed to the virus via cattle for signs of infection.\n\nThe WHO still considers the risk to humans low but urged countries to rapidly share information to enable real-time monitoring of the situation to ensure preparedness as the virus continues to spread.\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maeve_cullinan@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Maeve Cullinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2024/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000313073599_17163739693460_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdX_p8zrfPOdyL47zPLcV0RJV6xWXZnfgbn7PLjMrFrY.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

announced Wednesday, less then two months after the first one as an outbreak of the disease circulates widely among dairy cows.\n\nBoth individuals infected with the virus called H5N1 -- the first in Texas, the second in Michigan -- were dairy farm workers who suffered only minor symptoms and have recovered, according to authorities.\n\nDespite the second infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its risk assessment for the general public remained \"low,\" but it did suggest it expects more cases.\n\nGiven the high levels of the virus \"in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nHowever, \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the US general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nThe latest case in Michigan was detected in \"a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been

fallen severely sick.\n\nCows and goats joined the list of victims in March, surprising experts because the animals were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.\n\nVirus fragments have meanwhile been found in pasteurized milk, but health authorities say milk sold in US stores is safe because pasteurization effectively kills the disease.\n\nThere is no evidence of human-to-human

However, a different and highly contagious strain was discovered on an egg farm. The H5N1 strain of the flu has, in the recent years, killed billions of wild birds, farmers and spread to mammal species as well. This case is a first in both humans and animals and according to the health authorities in Australia's southeastern state of Victoria, contact tracing was not effective in identifying other cases of the same. This is why the chances of others getting infected due to the flu are low.\n\nAccording to doctors, the child experienced severe infection but is not unwell any longer. So far, Australia was the only continent where animals were free of the H5N1 avian influenza so far. But on Wednesday, a different strain of the flu was detected at an egg farm near Melbourne. Initial lab tests revealed that the virus is still unidentified ans the H7 strain possibly came from the wild bird population seen in Australia before.\n\nEarlier, the H5N1 flu was detected in milk and researchers shared simple techniques to mitigate the risk of contracting the potentially deadly infection.

This is the second case associated with an ongoing multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) in dairy cows.[i] As with the case in Texas, the individual is a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows. While a nasal swab from the person tested negative for influenza in Michigan, an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus, indicating an eye infection. Similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms. CDC has been watching influenza surveillance systems closely, particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance.\n\nBased on the information available, this infection does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low. However, this development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\n\nA dairy worker who was being monitored because of their work exposure to H5N1-infected cattle reported symptoms to local health officials. Two specimens were collected from the patient. An upper respiratory tract specimen collected from the worker's nose was negative for influenza virus at the state health department laboratory. The eye specimen was sent to CDC for testing because it is one of a few labs where those specimens can be used with the CDC A(H5) test. The specimen was received by CDC and testing results confirmed A(H5) virus infection. The nasal specimen was retested at CDC and confirmed to be negative for influenza. The state was then notified of the results. The designation of the influenza virus neuraminidase (the N in the subtype) is pending genetic sequencing at CDC. Attempts to sequence the virus in the clinical specimen are underway and will be made available within 1-2 days if successful. Additional genetic analysis will look for any changes to the virus that could alter the agency's risk assessment.\n\nConjunctivitis (eye infection) has been associated with previous human infections with avian influenza A viruses and is part of the current CDC case definition for A(H5N1) surveillance. While it's not known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures, it may be from contamination of the eye(s), potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eye(s) with something contaminated with A(H5N1) virus, such as a hand. High levels of A(H5N1) virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows.\n\nThis case was detected through the state's implementation of CDC's recommended monitoring and testing strategies in exposed persons. In addition to enhanced and targeted surveillance, CDC also has:\n\nGiven the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified. Sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.\n\nMore information is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm.\n\n[1] first human case of A(H5N1) bird flu in the United States linked to an outbreak in dairy cows was also the first likely case of human infection with A(H5N1) from a cow globally. This was reported on April 1, 2024. The person reported eye redness as their only symptom, consistent with conjunctivitis, and recovered. Learn more about this case in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine titled Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Infection in a Dairy Farm Worker. The April 1 case was actually the second human case of A(H5N1) reported in the United States. The first human case of A(H5N1) bird flu in the United States was reported in 2022 in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in depopulating poultry with presumptive A(H5N1) bird flu. The 2022 human case was not related to dairy cattle. The person only reported fatigue without any other symptoms and recovered.

The recommendations are intended to help keep a \"heightened awareness\" of influenza transmission during the summer season amid an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.\n\nLocal health officials are encouraged to work with laboratories to increase submissions of positive flu virus samples for subtyping, the process used to determine whether an influenza sample is a \"common, seasonal\" flu virus or a \"novel virus\" like the bird flu, the CDC said.\n\nThe meeting on Tuesday included CDC Influenza Division Director Vivien Dugan; the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials; the Association of Public Health Laboratories; Big Cities Health Coalition; the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; and the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the CDC via email for additional information on Tuesday.\n\nOnly two known cases of human H5N1 infections have been reported in the United States. A dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for the virus last month. The first case was reported in 2022 and involved a Colorado poultry worker.\n\nAccording to the CDC's count, over 90 million cases of the H5N1 virus have been detected in wild aquatic birds, poultry and common backyard flocks across the nation since January 2022. The first known transmission of the virus to dairy cattle was reported in Texas in March. To date, 51 dairy herds across nine U.S. states have reported an outbreak in the bird flu virus in livestock.\n\nThere has been concern that the spread of bird flu in animals could lead to a new epidemic or pandemic, although there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC issued a health alert on April 1 after reports of the Texas dairy farmer's positive case, but told Newsweek at the time that the risk of infection \"to the general public\" remains \"low.\"\n\nThose working with birds or livestock are encouraged to use personal protective equipment to lower the risk of H5N1 infection. Symptoms of the virus can include acute respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, sore throat, fever, coughing and shortness of breath.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there have been 889 human cases of bird flu infections from 2003 to April 2024 across 23 countries.

It's likely not new.\" H7N7 is the most common type of bird flu in Australia and a H7 strain was one of those in the last bird flu outbreak in the country in 2020 which affected a third of egg farms in Victoria.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nTesting is currently underway to find out if this new outbreak is the same strain as the 2020 virus. Meanwhile, the farm has been quarantined up to a 5km radius and affected animals will be destroyed. Experts at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong are examining the samples.\n\nBird flu is highly contagious and can wipe out entire populations of domestic poultry. Wild birds are the hosts and contamination can occur when they come into contact with farmed birds.\n\nMore than 50 mammal species have been found to have the deadly H5N1 including humans. Many infected people have mild or no symptoms but some can get severely ill. Eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk to the public, local authorities said.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_smith@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joe Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geelong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geelong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32867081.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bird-Flu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: Bloomberg / Contributor via Getty Images)\n\nA second human case of bird flu has been linked to the ongoing outbreak in cows on U.S. dairy farms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Wednesday (May 22).\n\nA subtype of avian influenza called H5N1 was initially discovered in U.S. cows in March and has since been detected among cattle in nine states. The commercial milk and meat supply is safe to consume, although raw milk samples from sick cows have been found to carry the virus, so unpasteurized milk might pose a risk of infection to humans.\n\nHowever, no human infections with H5N1 have yet been tied to consuming raw milk; the two human cases flagged so far affected dairy workers employed by farms with H5N1-infected cows. The first possible case of cow-to-human transmission, reported in April in Texas, involved an individual whose only symptom was eye redness. The second case, just identified in Michigan, also involved only eye-related symptoms.\n\nThe person infected in Michigan tested negative for bird flu when a swab sample was taken from their nose, but an eye swab from the patient tested positive.\n\nRelated: 32 diseases you can catch from animals\n\n\"It's not known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures,\" the CDC report notes. They may arise from contamination of the eyes \"with a splash of contaminated fluid,\" such as milk, or else touching the eyes with a hand contaminated with the virus.\n\nThe CDC is now analyzing the genetic makeup of the virus that infected the Michigan patient and will release those data soon. In the meantime, the CDC still considers the risk of bird flu spread to the general public to be low.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\"Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC says. \"Sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- 1st polar bear death from bird flu spells trouble for species\n\n-- Highly pathogenic bird flu behind 'unusual deaths in cats' in Poland, WHO says\n\n-- UK's first human case of H5N1 avian flu detected in man with pet ducks\n\nThe agency has issued guidance for people working with H5N1-infected animals and those potentially exposed to the virus. For instance, people should avoid close, long or unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry and cows. They should also avoid unprotected exposure to the animals' poop, bedding, unpasteurized milk and materials that have been in close contact with animals with suspected or confirmed H5N1 infections.\n\nH5N1 is known to be deadly to poultry, but in humans, the symptoms triggered by the virus can vary widely, from being completely absent to being fatal. Only three cases of human H5N1 infection have ever been reported in the U.S. and all have been very mild. Available drugs for the seasonal flu can treat the infection in people.\n\nInitial genetic testing of the virus on farms has not indicated that the virus has picked up any mutations that would make it more likely to spread easily between people. However, the CDC is closely monitoring the situation with that possibility in mind.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\n\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.\"\n\nThe Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed additional cases in cows this week, bringing the total in that state to 19 herds on Wednesday.\n\nNationally, at least 51 herds in nine states have been affected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In addition to herds in Michigan, dairy cattle in Kansas, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas have also tested positive for bird flu.\n\nFederal health authorities are expected to hold a media briefing on the matter later Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC's principal deputy director, Dr. Nirav Shah, asked state and local health authorities in a call to continue monitoring for flu \"at enhanced levels\" throughout the summer, even though the typical flu season is over and testing for the virus falls to a minimum at this time of year.\n\nThe bird flu, also known as H5N1, is a type of influenza A virus.\n\nShah said that the CDC recommended that states \"increase the number of positive influenza A virus samples submitted for subtyping to help detect even rare cases of human H5N1 virus infection in the community,\" the agency said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nSince the H5N1 virus was first identified in 1997, there have been just over 900 cases documented globally in humans. More than 50% of those patients died, according to the CDC. But that fatality rate may be an overestimate because cases may also be mild and possibly go undetected.\n\nIn March, a dairy worker in Texas was diagnosed with the bird flu. It was the first documented case of the flu spreading from a cow to a human. The man's only indication that he was sick was that he developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. He had none of the typical flu symptoms, such as fever, cough and sneezing, and later recovered.\n\nThis is the third case overall in the United States. In 2022, an inmate in Colorado was diagnosed with the virus. The man was working on a commercial farm culling birds suspected to be infected. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered with a course of Tamiflu.\n\nThere is no evidence at this point that H5N1 is spreading from person to person. None of the people living with the Texas dairy worker became ill.\n\nThe CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza",

What do we know?", "body": "Two different strains of avian influenza -- also known as \"bird flu\" -- have been detected in Victoria.\n\nAustralia's first-ever human case of the virus manifested in a child returning from an overseas trip in March, but was only confirmed over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent outbreak at an egg farm led to hundreds of thousands of chickens being euthanased.\n\nThe two events are not related and stem from two different variants of bird flu. The virus picked up by the child is the H5N1 variant that has swept the world since 2020, killing millions of wild birds.\n\nHealth officials say the risk of additional human cases in Australia is \"very low\", but recommend Australians take precautions against its spread.\n\nHere's what to know about bird flu, how it's transmitted to humans, and whether it's still safe to eat poultry and eggs.\n\nAvian influenza is an infectious disease that spreads widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, as well as domestic ones such as poultry.\n\nThere are many strains of avian influenza and Victoria's Department of Health says \"most of them don't infect humans\".\n\n\"Some subtypes, including H5N1, are more likely to cause disease and death in poultry,\" it said.\n\nThere is a current outbreak of H5N1 in other parts of the world, including in dairy cows in the United States.\n\nThe transmission of avian influenza from birds or animals to humans is \"very rare,\" Victoria's Department of Health said in a statement.\n\n\"Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact.\"\n\nClare Looker, Victoria's chief health officer (CHO), said the avian influenza was \"much less transmissible\" than the seasonal flu and she was confident no one else had caught the virus in the state.\n\n\"We think there's a very, very low risk that there has been any other transmission,\" she told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\nThe Department of Health said the child who caught H5N1 has no links to the H7N3 strain identified at the egg farm on Wednesday.\n\nThe H7N3 strain is the most common type of avian influenza detected in Australia, Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Graeme Cooke, said.\n\nAt the Victorian farm, Dr Cooke said the virus was spreading \"very quickly\" and was causing \"increasing levels of death\" among birds.\n\nHe said it was important to control these outbreaks because of the \"small risk\" of transmission from birds to humans.\n\n\"The more avian flu is circulating, the more that risk might actually become something of more relevance to our public health system.\"\n\nA Texas farm worker tested positive for the virus earlier this year as it spread through a US cattle herd.\n\nIn humans, the symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever, coughing, headaches, aching muscles and respiratory symptoms, the Department of Health said.\n\n\"Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms,\" it said.\n\n\"The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes.\"\n\nThe department said the Victorian child experienced \"a severe infection\" but was no longer unwell and had made a \"full recovery\".\n\n\"You can't catch avian influenza through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of avian influenza,\" Victoria's Department of Health said.\n\nVeterinarian Dr Cooke also said it was safe for Australians to keep eating eggs and chicken.\n\nWhile Dr Cooke said he was not worried about this type of strain being passed to other animals, he urged poultry farmers to do their part to prevent further infections.\n\n\"This is something that's carried by wild birds without symptoms, traditionally ducks and other types of waterfowl, and then their faecal material is allowed to make contact with domestic poultry, which are very, very susceptible to [infection],\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we emphasise that poultry farmers should really have high levels of biosecurity, trying their best to separate wild fowl and ducks from domestic poultry.\"\n\nRowan McMonnies, the chief executive of industry body Australian Eggs, said only a small part of the industry has been affected, adding that farmers would be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves\".\n\nThe Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said its companies had also stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution, but that \"no discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level\".\n\nBird flu was last detected in Australia in 2020, when it was found on an egg farm south of Ballarat.\n\nThis resulted in multiple outbreaks in Victoria and led to tens of thousands of farmed birds being euthanased.\n\nDr Looker said the child in Victoria had caught a type of H5N1 that has been circulating in India and Bangladesh.\n\n\"There's a handful of cases, a very small number, fewer than five, where there have been human cases of this strain internationally.\"\n\nShe said the H5N1 virus in Victoria, whilst sharing the same name, was different to the type of H5N1 spreading through the United States and affecting dairy cows.\n\n\"My understanding is it's not at the same level of concern as the United States variety.\"\n\nDr Looker said her team was unsure where the child picked up the virus, but noted when humans did contract H5N1 like this, it was likely from exposure to poultry.\n\n\"So either visiting poultry farms or live wet markets, which have birds at them, or if they've had a lot of contact with domesticated birds,\" she said.\n\n\"Occasionally, people can also get it from handling the meat or eggs of infected birds.\n\n\"We couldn't identify a clear event that led to this child's infection, but we suspect it's one of those things.\"\n\nAustralia is the only continent where animals have so far stayed free of the H5N1 virus.\n\nDr Looker said there were a number of surveillance mechanisms in place across the country in both human specimens and animal flocks to ensure this virus continued to be detected.\n\nThe Victorian Department of Health recommends on its website that Australians take the following precautions against the H5N1 bird flu:", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what to know.", "body": "A Michigan dairy farm worker has become the second human in the United States to contract bird flu, also known as avian influenza, amid the latest outbreak among cattle. The person has already recovered and only had mild symptoms, state health officials said in a statement. Health officials still consider the risk to the general public to be low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added in their own May 22 press statement. But the CDC is stepping up precautions, especially for people in close contact with dairy cattle.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the latest developments.\n\nThe Michigan dairy worker is the second person to contract bird flu this year, and only the third ever in the U.S. Bird flu -- which is technically a strain of influenza A, known to scientists as H5N1 -- is widespread in wild birds and, to a lesser extent, poultry. In the U.S., the virus began spreading among poultry in 2022, when the first person contracted the virus while culling an infected flock in Colorado, according to the CDC. The virus began spreading for the first time among dairy cattle in the U.S. in 2024. A Texas dairy farm worker tested positive in April, and the Michigan dairy farm worker, the latest case, has now become the third-ever U.S. case.\n\nSince 2003, there have been more than 880 human bird flu cases worldwide, according to the CDC. But they are still rare and \"sporadic,\" occurring primarily in other countries. Until recently, the largest outbreaks have occurred as the result of exposures at poultry markets, which are common in certain countries including Egypt, China and Indonesia. But, since 2021, human cases of bird flu have begun cropping up in countries that had never had them before. Australia, for one, reported on May 22 its first-ever case of bird flu, in a child who was infected in March after traveling to India. The child's infection was \"severe,\" but they have since recovered, according to Australian health officials.\n\nAll of the infections reported in the U.S. have been mild. Like the Texas dairy farm worker, the only symptom the latest infected person in Michigan had was pink eye (also known as conjunctivitis). In fact, the Michigan farm worker initially tested negative for bird flu when a nasal swab was used; they only tested positive after an eye tissue swab, according to a press statement from the CDC. Fatigue was the only symptom reported by the American poultry worker infected in 2022, and all three Americans who have had bird flu have made full recoveries. However, bird flu has led to severe infections and even 463 fatalities in other countries in the past, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nViruses mutate constantly. But the latest bird flu mutations are somewhat worrisome. \"This virus getting into cattle is relatively new and somewhat unexpected,\" Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan professor of epidemiology who specializes in viruses, tells Yahoo Life. Bird flu becoming widespread among cattle means the virus has become better at infecting mammals, bringing it a step close to being able to infect humans easily. But, so far, the virus has only infected people in close, prolonged contact with dairy cattle.\n\nNot unless you're a dairy farm worker. There have been no instances of the virus spreading between people. And while more than 50 herds of dairy cattle have been infected, only two people have contracted bird flu in the U.S., out of the nation's more than 100,000 dairy farm workers. However, the CDC has asked states to keep a close eye out for human infections. Officials on May 21 asked states to continue analyzing samples from people who test positive for flu throughout the summer, maintaining the level of surveillance that would be typical for the winter height of flu seasons.\n\nYes, experts say. Although fragments of bird flu have been found in some 20% of grocery store milk samples, these pieces of the virus cannot cause infection. So far, pasteurization -- the standard sterilization process milk goes through -- has proven very effective at inactivating bird flu in milk. Health officials have warned against drinking raw milk, however, which is unsterilized and can carry all manner of viruses and bacteria. Cooking ground beef to medium well or well-done temperatures also kills the virus.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

announced Wednesday, less then two months after the first one as an outbreak of the disease circulates widely among dairy cows.\n\nBoth individuals infected with the virus called H5N1 -- the first in Texas, the second in Michigan -- were dairy farm workers who suffered only minor symptoms and have recovered, according to authorities.\n\nDespite the second infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its risk assessment for the general public remained \"low,\" but it did suggest it expects more cases.\n\nGiven the high levels of the virus \"in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nHowever, \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the US general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nThe latest case in Michigan was detected in \"a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows,\" the CDC said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Health and Human Services, the worker had only mild symptoms and has recovered.\n\nTwo specimens were collected from the worker -- one from the nose and the other from the eye -- with only the eye specimen testing positive.\n\nAdditionally, \"similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms,\" the CDC said.\n\n- Chickens, cows, humans -\n\nAs of Wednesday a total of 52 US herds were infected with bird flu across nine of the 50 states.\n\n\"People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock)... are at greater risk of infection,\" the CDC said.\n\nThough the current H5N1 strain has killed millions of poultry during the present wave, affected cows have not fallen severely sick.\n\nCows and goats joined the list of victims in March, surprising experts because the animals were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.\n\nVirus fragments have meanwhile been found in pasteurized milk, but health authorities say milk sold in US stores is safe because pasteurization effectively kills the disease.\n\nThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at present but health officials fear that if the virus were to eventually spread widely it could mutate into a form that could pass between humans.\n\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

And so we make that investment,\" said Worobey, a Canadian who is a professor and department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.\n\nBut with the biological version of a forest fire, \"where these viruses can spread like wildfire through animals and people -- we're still basically just flying blind,\" said Worobey. And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"\n\nAcross the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID -- but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.\n\nAnd even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.\n\nBird flu in the U.S.\n\nThe H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.\n\nIt took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.\n\nSince the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states.\n\nThe response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"\n\nCanada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.\n\nThe government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu. Around the same time, it said it would begin conducting tests of retail milk for viral fragments. (The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that 142 samples of retail milk tested negative for fragments of bird flu.)\n\n\"Canada is certainly no better in terms of preparing in advance for the certainty that there's going to be outbreaks in animals that could then have pandemic potential,\" Worobey said.\n\nIn an email, Health Canada said that \"based on current scientific evidence, the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low.\"\n\nFor now, there is no suggestion that bird flu is being spread in cattle by respiratory droplets -- an important distinction when identifying its potential for pandemic transmission.\n\nInstead, scientists believe that the virus, which is found in greater concentrations in a cow's udder, is being spread through animals coming in contact with the virus in milking equipment.\n\nThe virus causes mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which affects milk production; the milk of infected cows appears curdled and is thrown out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in early May that tests confirmed that pasteurization is effective at killing any live virus.\n\nThere is a risk, however low, that bird flu can spread to farm workers who touch infected animals, as it did in April in Texas, where a worker's eye became inflamed due to the virus.\n\nThe CDC recommended last week that state health departments in the U.S. work with their agriculture counterparts to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers on dairy farms, poultry farms and in slaughterhouses.\n\nA number of infectious disease experts are also calling for the development of more specific vaccines for birds, animals and humans.\n\nScaling up production of human vaccines against the new H5N1 variants \"seems imperative,\" a group of researchers wrote in a paper that ran in the April edition of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, \"primarily to protect high-risk individuals such as farm workers against infection, but also for stockpiling, and secondly to increase preparedness should the virus evolve to sustained human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nA new variant of a well-known threat\n\nBird flu is not new.\n\nIn the late '90s, an outbreak in Hong Kong in chickens jumped into humans, infecting 18 people and causing six deaths. In the following years, there have been other small outbreaks with similarly high mortality rates.\n\nIn the last couple of years, however, the virus has spread to affect more wild birds than ever before.\n\nIt has continued to jump from wild birds to domestic poultry, where it can cause severe disease and death. Millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nAnd for the first time, the current subvariant of H5N1 has shown a propensity to jump to mammals \"and in some cases likely transmit mammal to mammal,\" Worobey said -- \"We've seen that in mink. We saw that in sea lions.\"\n\nBut \"we've never seen it in something like cattle, which are terrestrial mammals that we have very, very close interactions with, every day, directly and indirectly through their product,\" said Worobey.\n\nAs of last summer, the virus had affected at least 26 species, according to a statement by the World Health Organization. At the time of the statement, WHO recommended that given the unprecedented spread of the avian influenza virus among birds and mammals, and the potential risk to humans, that countries enhance biosecurity measures on farms, rapidly detect and report animal outbreaks and strengthen influenza surveillance in animals and humans.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. has a limited stockpile of H5N1 vaccines that target earlier strains of the virus and were made using traditional egg-based vaccine manufacturing.\n\nWork has already started on mRNA vaccines -- first used in COVID -- against bird flu at the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Drew Weissman, a physician and immunologist, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on mRNA vaccine research with Katalin Karik\u00f3, an adjunct professor of neurosurgery, also at Penn.\n\nThe vaccines can take as little as a month to create, said Weissman, compared to nine months for more traditional vaccines. The University of Pennsylvania has been developing mRNA vaccine technology for use in animals for at least seven years and inoculation of cows was expected to begin this week. The work being done is in the research phase and there is no vaccine approved for animals by the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nWeissman said the goal was eventually to develop an mRNA vaccine against bird flu for humans.\n\n\"Certainly for cows, and farm workers who work with the cows, I think they need to be immunized,\" said Weissman.\n\nBut developing a vaccine takes money.\n\nWeissman said it costs $1.5 million just to make a vaccine and another $700,000 U.S. to do a toxicity study to understand elements such as potential adverse effects and safe dosages. That work has to be submitted to the FDA before clinical trials can start.\n\nCanada has two H5N1 pandemic vaccines -- authorized before mRNA technology came into use -- but they are currently not available.\n\nThe vaccine production process in this country is triggered by the World Health Organization.\n\nWHO would have to make a pandemic influenza declaration, or a recommendation that influenza vaccine manufacturers switch from seasonal to pandemic influenza vaccine, before production would start, said Health Canada in an email.\n\nThe government has agreements in place with several vaccine manufacturers -- domestic and international -- to ensure timely access to pandemic influenza vaccines for the entire Canadian population, according to the email, and has proactively met with GSK, the manufacturer that would make the vaccine, as well as other manufacturers, to discuss preparedness activities.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery,\" it said in another post without identifying the foreign country.\n\nBird flu detected in Victoria\n\nThe case was announced hours after bird flu was detected on a farm in Victoria, 9news.com.au said. \"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,\" Victoria Health said in a statement and added, that the child reportedly experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell.\n\n\"The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that take place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system,\" the news portal said quoting health officials.\n\nH5N1 strain\n\nVictoria Health said the child was the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first detected case of the H5N1 strain in the country. A different strain of bird flu was detected on the Victorian egg farm after several poultry deaths. \"While the human case detected today is the H5N1 strain, the strain on the farm was found to be a different H7N7 variety,\" the report said.\n\nA report in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said, \"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case. The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases are 'very low'.\"\n\nHumans are not at risk from this virus unless they had contact with infected birds or animals or their secretions. \"Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,\" the officials added.\n\nElaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there. The property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak. Bird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajeet_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajeet Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/05/bird-flu-in-australia-1716390636.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The CDC states the risk to the public remains low. Officials believe unpasteurized milk is the primary vector, prompting increased testing and financial support for farmers.\n\nA second human case of bird flu has been confirmed in the United States since the virus was first detected in dairy cattle in late March, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. The infection of a dairy worker in Michigan expands the outbreak of the virus that has circulated in poultry for years, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe CDC told reporters on a call it has not seen evidence of human to human transmission of bird flu and that it tested close to 40 people since March, including the Michigan worker. All the people who were tested were connected to or had exposures on a dairy farm, the CDC said. A Texas dairy worker was confirmed to be infected in April.\n\nMichigan and Texas are among nine states that have reported bird flu in dairy herds. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration findings of H5N1 virus particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Similar to the Texas case, the patient in Michigan only reported eye symptoms, the CDC said. The Michigan worker had mild symptoms and recovered, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe worker had regular exposure to livestock infected with bird flu, Michigan said. The leading hypothesis is that the case was a result of cow to human transmission, according to CDC. The agency said \"similar additional human cases could be identified\" given high levels of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread in dairy cows.\n\nInfluenza experts said the second case associated with exposure to dairy cattle was concerning. \"It is worrisome that the virus is spreading widely in cows because this can lead to changes in the virus that could potentially increase human susceptibility,\" said Scott Hensley, an influenza vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with infected wild birds or poultry, and scientists have long viewed the virus as being capable of causing a global health crisis. \"It doesn't appear to be the start of a pandemic but we urgently need to assess if additional human cases have occurred,\" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FARMERS, VACCINE DISCUSSIONS The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus among cows, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads.\n\nTo limit transmission in cattle, the USDA in late April started requiring dairy cows to test negative before being shipped across state lines. The USDA will provide financial support to farmers whose herds have not tested positive for avian flu for developing and implementing biosecurity and testing measures, said senior adviser Eric Deeble.\n\nThe agency will also retroactively compensate farmers for lost milk due to infected herds, Deeble said. \"It's likely that there will be several cases that emanate from exposure to infected cows and their milk amongst farm workers,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"The key thing is to make sure that testing is wide enough to capture them.\" Nirav Shah, CDC's principal deputy director, said the agency received the Michigan patient sample on Tuesday and confirmed the positive test result that evening. Investigators are looking into whether the worker was wearing or was offered protective equipment.\n\nA nasal swab from the worker tested negative for influenza in the state, but an eye swab was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the bird flu virus, the agency said. The CDC said it recommended isolation, not quarantine, for close contacts of the person who tested positive for avian flu. It added that close contacts of exposed workers will be offered antiviral drugs.\n\nThe U.S. is in \"active conversations\" with mRNA vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna on a potential vaccine for humans, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) official said. Last week, the U.S. government started the process of manufacturing about 4.8 million doses of vaccine matched to the currently circulating strain of H5N1, a move that Dawn O'Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS said \"further strengthens our preparedness posture.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

In April the CDC confirmed the first human case of the year, a dairy farm worker infected in Texas. Both infected individuals had prolonged close contact with infected cattle and only experienced pink eye as a symptom. The CDC maintains that the risk to the general public is \"low.\"\n\nDairy cattle herds have been infected in Texas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota. Cases in birds in New York City parks and green spaces have also been confirmed by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai researchers.\n\nHow concerned should you be about bird flu, and what might this mean for the food supply? Here's what you need to know.\n\nBird flu -- clinically known as influenza A (H5N1) -- is a variation of flu virus that spreads primarily among birds and poultry and can be highly contagious and even fatal among birds, according to the CDC. Occasionally, the virus will jump to other animals if they eat infected birds or drink water contaminated by the feces of infected birds, the CDC says. That has become more common in recent years. Viruses are constantly mutating, and the more they spread, the more they mutate. A recent family of variants may be particularly adept at infecting other animals, including cattle, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIt's rare for the virus to infect humans, and when it does happen, it's usually confined to one person who was in close contact with an infected animal and doesn't spread to others. Bird flu may cause mild to severe sickness in humans, and it has the potential to cause pneumonia and severe, sometimes fatal lung inflammation. Since 2020, there have been 26 cases in humans confirmed by the WHO, seven of which have been fatal.\n\nTwo people have been infected in this year's outbreak among dairy cattle, making a total of three people in the U.S. who have had the virus ever. (The first-ever U.S. case was in a poultry worker who contracted the virus in 2022 while culling infected birds and recovered after experiencing only mild fatigue.)\n\nThe Michigan dairy farm worker was being closely monitored after coming into contact with infected dairy cattle. Their only symptom was pink eye, and they initially tested negative for H5N1 when their nose was swabbed. However, an eye swab confirmed that they had bird flu. They have since made a full recovery.\n\nThe first human case of 2024 (and second case ever) detected in the U.S. was a dairy farm worker in Texas, who was diagnosed in late March after developing pink eye. Eye inflammation was the only symptom the Texas dairy worker experienced; they never developed any respiratory symptoms that health officials might have expected with bird flu.\n\nThe federal government is providing $200 million to help stem transmission, Reuters reported on May 10. The CDC has also requested that states provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to dairy farm workers who might be at risk, according to an emailed statement. Federal funding will provide each affected farm with up to $28,000 a day toward measures to slow the spread among animals and prevent transmission to humans, CNN reported. Health agencies will also get $101 million for continued food safety monitoring.\n\nDairy and poultry farmworkers remain the CDC's main concern. On May 6, the agency asked state health and agriculture departments to provide PPE to dairy farm workers at risk of contracting bird flu in an effort to prevent any additional cases, the agency said in an emailed statement. The agency has also asked state health officials to take other steps like making sure they have bird flu tests available to confirm possible infections. It also said health officials should stay in close contact with veterinarians and agriculture department officials and asked to be notified of any \"challenges\" states encounter.\n\nFor the general public, the risk remains low, the CDC says. Although human bird flu cases are extremely rare in the U.S., the CDC has asked states to step up their monitoring for the virus. Summer brings a lull in cases of common human flu, so testing often falls off. But, on May 21, the CDC said states should keep their monitoring at peak levels, testing positive flu samples to see if the illness was caused by H5N1.\n\nAfter particles of the bird flu virus were discovered in about 1 in 5 samples of grocery store milk, further Food and Drug Administration testing has confirmed that the virus was inactivated by pasteurization, a sterilizing process used on more than 99% of the commercial milk supply. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also tested ground beef for bird flu, and all the samples came back negative.\n\nBird flu has also been found in unpasteurized milk, but you shouldn't consume unpasteurized milk or cheese regardless, the CDC warns, because they carry risk of infections like listeria. The CDC also says that the risk of being infected from eating eggs is low, and properly cooking them would kill any virus anyway.\n\nFarms are prohibited from selling products -- including milk and eggs -- from sick animals, so it's unlikely that contaminated food would wind up on grocery store shelves. The most likely impact of the bird flu outbreak in animals on the food supply is rising prices. Egg prices have shot up as chickens have been culled or died, limiting the supply of eggs. Milk prices could see increases but are stable so far.\n\nOn April 15, Colombia became the first country to restrict the importation of beef and beef products from U.S. states with infected herds, Reuters reported.\n\nTwo candidate vaccines -- drafts of what would become the shots -- seem to be good matches for the current strain of bird flu, the Washington Post reports. The federal government has a stockpile of enough doses to vaccinate a fifth of the American population, officials told Barron's. However, the vaccines are undergoing clinical testing, so it's unclear how effective they will be. Antiviral drugs can also be used to treat bird flu, although the CDC says that some variations of bird flu first found in Asia aren't as responsive to these treatments.\n\nDr. Arnold Monto, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Michigan and member of the FDA's vaccine committee, tells Yahoo Life that the U.S.'s bird flu vaccines require adjuvants, ingredients that improve human's immune responses. An official with the Department of Health and Human Services also told the Washington Post that components for the vaccines are being tested, and it would likely take weeks to months for them to be ready for widespread distribution. Monto adds that the vaccine would also likely be given to only those at high risk -- poultry and dairy farmworkers -- since there's no evidence that bird flu spreads among humans.\n\nAvoid close or prolonged contact with wild birds, cattle or any other animal suspected of being infected. The CDC also recommends steering clear of surfaces that may be contaminated with raw milk, animal feces, litter or anything else that might have crossed paths with an infected animal.\n\nCooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165\u02daF will kill off any virus. It's also recommended for milk drinkers to consume only pasteurized milk to prevent contracting bird flu or other viruses or bacteria from raw foods, and to avoid raw or undercooked foods sourced from animals that may be infected with bird flu.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis",

The child acquired the avian influenza A (H5N1) infection while in India, and was unwell in March this year,\" 9news.com.au said quoting state health officials.\n\n''A human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection, also known as \"bird flu\", has been reported in Victoria. There is no evidence of transmission in Victoria and the chance of additional human cases is very low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people,'' the Victorian Department of Health posted on X.\n\n''The recently reported case was in a child who returned to Australia from overseas in March 2024. The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery,'' it said in another post without identifying the foreign country.\n\nThe case was announced hours after bird flu was detected on a farm in Victoria, 9news.com.au said.\n\n\"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,\" the Victoria Health said in a statement and added, that the child reportedly experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell.\n\n\"The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that take place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system,\" the news portal said quoting health officials.\n\nVictoria Health said the child was the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first detected case of the H5N1 strain in the country. A different strain of bird flu was detected on the Victorian egg farm after several poultry deaths.\n\n\"While the human case detected today is the H5N1 strain, the strain on the farm was found to be a different H7N7 variety,\" the report said.\n\nA report in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said, \"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case. The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases are 'very low'.\" Humans are not at risk from this virus unless they had contact with infected birds or animals or their secretions. \"Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,\" the officials added.\n\nElaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there.\n\nThe property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak.\n\nBird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/22_05_2024_14_18_31_6689958.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low, officials said.\n\nIn a statement, the CDC noted that an initial nasal swab turned up negative for influenza, but an eye swab sent to the agency tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus. Similar to the other U.S. case reported earlier this year, the Michigan patient only had eye symptoms.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported eye inflammation and was treated with an antiviral drug.\n\n\"CDC has been watching influenza surveillance systems closely, particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance,\" the agency said, adding that the new Michigan case \"does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\"\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears, and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan.

the disease circulates widely among dairy cows.\n\nBoth individuals infected with the virus called H5N1 -- the first in Texas, the second in Michigan -- were dairy farm workers who suffered only minor

\"low,\" but it did suggest it expects more cases.\n\nGiven the high levels of the virus \"in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nHowever, \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the US general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nThe latest case in Michigan was detected in \"a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows,\" the CDC said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Health and Human Services, the worker had only mild symptoms and has recovered.\n\nTwo specimens were collected from the worker -- one from the nose and the other from the eye -- with only the eye specimen testing positive.\n\nAdditionally, \"similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms,\" the CDC said.\n\nChickens, cows, humans\n\nAs of Wednesday a total of 52 US herds were infected with

It's just the third human case ever detected in the U.S. and the second of the current outbreak that has alarmed public health officials who are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate.\n\nThe new case in Michigan involves a dairy worker with \"mild symptoms,\" according to state officials, and the current risk to the general public \"remains low.\"\n\nThe first human case of H5N1 in the U.S. was detected in Colorado in 2022 when a poultry farm worker contracted the virus. The second human case in the U.S., and the first of this current outbreak, happened in Texas around April 1 when a farm worker presumably became infected by cattle.\n\nPreviously, bird flu had only been transmitted directly from birds to other animals, but the Texas case was the first known instance of the virus being transmitted between mammals. Dozens of dairy herds have been detected in nine states, though farm owners have reportedly been trying to hide infections from federal authorities.\n\nNews outlet NOTUS recently quoted a dairy farmer in Texas who said he didn't believe bird flu is real, telling the reporter, \"You must be listening to CNN or something. Fake news.\"\n\nThe virus is spreading rapidly in Michigan, with three more infected dairy herds detected, according to a report from the state's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development on Monday. And while the current nationwide outbreak is concerning, it's not like health experts didn't see this coming. When more bird flu cases started popping up in mammals in 2023, the World Health Organization took note, issuing a warning about the disease.\n\nState officials in Michigan have stressed they have the situation well monitored, and are keeping tabs as best they can with an evolving situation.\n\n\"Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan,\" Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the state, said in a statement published online. \"Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available.\"\n\nImportantly, there hasn't been any case of H5N1 jumping between humans, and with any luck, it will stay that way.\n\n\"The current health risk to the general public remains low. This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point,\" said Bagdasarian.\n\nTesting of milk from infected cows has shown bird flu to become inactive thanks to pasteurization, but raw milk can contain the active virus. Disturbingly, some people have started drinking raw milk recently under the mistaken belief it will give them \"immunity\" from the virus. Do not drink raw milk in an effort to protect yourself from bird blue because that's not how immunity works. And this is just about the worst time to attempt those kind of DIY experiments.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f54886974fdf9589e76935e6a1ddb5c4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 758, "textEnd": 765}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,\" the officials added.\n\nElaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there.\n\nThe property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-04/c2jel32k_bird-flu_625x300_06_April_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240506.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

outbreak of the disease circulates widely among dairy cows.\n\nBoth individuals infected with the virus called H5N1 -- the first in Texas, the second in Michigan -- were dairy farm workers who suffered only minor symptoms and have recovered, according to authorities.\n\nDespite the second infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its risk assessment for the general public remained \"low,\" but it did suggest it expects more cases.\n\nGiven the high levels of the virus \"in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nHowever, \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the US general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nThe latest case in Michigan was detected in \"a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows,\" the CDC said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Health and Human Services, the worker had only mild symptoms and has recovered.\n\nTwo specimens were collected from the worker -- one from the nose and the other from the eye -- with only the eye specimen testing positive.\n\nAdditionally, \"similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms,\" the CDC said.\n\n- Chickens, cows, humans -\n\nAs of Wednesday a total of 52 US herds were infected with bird flu across nine of the 50 states.\n\n\"People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock)... are at greater risk of

authorities say milk sold in US stores is safe because pasteurization effectively kills the disease.\n\nThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at present but health officials fear that if the virus were to eventually spread widely it could mutate into a form that could pass between humans.\n\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds

The spread of bird flu among dairy cattle reflects an expansion of the range of mammals that can be sickened by the virus that typically infects birds.\n\nInfluenza experts said finding a second case of bird flu in humans was worrisome. Scientists are on alert for changes in H5N1 that could signal the virus is adapting to spread easily among humans. The virus has caused serious or fatal infections among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. It has long been on the list of viruses with pandemic potential, and any expansion to a new mammal species is concerning.\n\nThe infections in cattle are from the same subtype of bird flu that has been infecting wild birds and poultry flocks globally for more than two years, also killing several mammal species that likely contracted the virus from consuming sick or dead birds. HOW WIDESPREAD IS THE BIRD FLU OUTBREAK IN CATTLE?\n\nThe full extent remains unknown, but several recent developments suggest it may be in more herds than documented. On April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has detected fragments of the H5N1 virus in the milk supply. It said tests of 297 samples found the remnants of virus were inactivated by the pasteurization process, and that the milk is safe. U.S. health officials believe people cannot get sick from drinking pasteurized milk but warn not to drink raw unpasteurized milk.\n\nOfficials have learned the virus can be present in cows that show no signs of infection, and milk from those cows does not show signs of infection such as being thicker or yellow. To contain the outbreak, the U.S. government is requiring dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu.\n\nWHEN DID THIS BIRD FLU OUTBREAK START? U.S. officials had thought the outbreak was recent, but new information suggests it may have started late last year.\n\nA study funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC published this month found bird flu was likely circulating on a limited basis as far back as late 2023. The study said it believed wild birds transmitted the virus to cattle, which then expanded when the cows were shipped to other states. HOW IS H5N1 SPREADING?\n\nIt remains unclear how the virus is spreading, but there is evidence of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and one case of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, officials reiterated. Because of the heavy viral load in milk and mammary glands, scientists suspect the virus is being spread to animals during the milking process, either through contact with infected equipment or with virus that becomes aerosolized during cleaning procedures.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the virus can spread through respiratory droplets that infect the airway, as flu viruses typically spread in humans. A nasal swab from the Michigan worker tested negative for influenza in a state lab. But an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the CDC said, indicating it may have been transmitted in that way.\n\nIS THERE A BIRD FLU VACCINE FOR HUMANS? The U.S. has a stockpile of bird flu vaccines matched with the strain currently circulating, as well as antivirals that could be used to treat human infections. For a major epidemic or a pandemic, the U.S. would have to scale up considerably.\n\nLast week, the U.S. government started manufacturing approximately 4.8 million doses of vaccine matched to the currently circulating strain of H5N1, a U.S. official said. Flu vaccine suppliers Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and CSL Seqirus have said they are monitoring avian flu and stand ready.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_droplet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory droplet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSL_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSL Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammary gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanofi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_29_28_0264767.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1358, "textEnd": 1366}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But until and unless we enhance our subtyping, we are basing that conclusion on negative implication rather than on affirmative data,\" Shah said in the interview.\n\nHe estimated that over the summer, roughly about 600 to 700 positive samples a week that could be subtyped will be collected nationally. In the meeting with the representatives of the state and local health agencies and the testing labs, none raised concerns about having to do the extra work, Shah said.\n\nThe outbreak, the first time H5N1 has been seen to transmit in dairy cattle, has been detected in 51 herds in nine states over the past two months. Scientists studying the phenomenon believe the virus is much more widespread. But reluctance on the part of farmers to cooperate with investigations has stymied efforts to gauge how far the virus has spread and how many people may have been infected.\n\nTo date only one human infection has been detected, in a man who worked on a Texas dairy farm. The man developed conjunctivitis, the only discernible sign that he had been infected.\n\nH5N1 is a virus that originated in wild ducks. But over the last 27 years, it has spread widely across the globe, killing hundreds of millions of poultry and a variety of mammalian species, including seals, bears, raccoons, and cats, both large and domestic. Until now, it has not been seen in cows.\n\nWhile it is not killing cattle, the virus' presence in a species with which people have regular contact is concerning, because it gives the virus more opportunities to evolve to be better at mammal-to-mammal spread, potentially even human-to-human spread. If it acquires that capacity, it could trigger a pandemic.\n\nIn addition to maintaining flu surveillance systems throughout the summer, the CDC and others are using detection of influenza A viruses in wastewater to try to look for places where the H5N1 virus might be spreading. H5N1 is an influenza A virus; so too are the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses that circulate during flu season. But because the latter two typically circulate at very low levels during the summer, it's thought that detecting flu A in wastewater could signal presence of H5N1 in a community -- whether that's in wild birds, cows, milk disposed of by an affected farm, or people.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_branswell@statnews.com", "name": "Helen Branswell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stat (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_State_and_Territorial_Health_Officials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of State and Territorial Health Officials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Public_Health_Laboratories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Public Health Laboratories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_State_and_Territorial_Epidemiologists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H3N2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H3N2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1197817881-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It has long been on the list of viruses with pandemic potential, and any expansion to a new mammal species is concerning.\n\nThe infections in cattle are from the same subtype of bird flu that has been infecting wild birds and poultry flocks globally for more than two years, also killing several mammal species that likely contracted the virus from consuming sick or dead birds.\n\nHOW WIDESPREAD IS THE BIRD FLU OUTBREAK IN CATTLE?\n\nThe full extent remains unknown, but several recent developments suggest it may be in more herds than documented.\n\nOn April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has detected fragments of the H5N1 virus in the milk supply. It said tests of 297 samples found the remnants of virus were inactivated by the pasteurization process, and that the milk is safe. U.S. health officials believe people cannot get sick from drinking pasteurized milk but warn not to drink raw unpasteurized milk.\n\nOfficials have learned the virus can be present in cows that show no signs of infection, and milk from those cows does not show signs of infection such as being thicker or yellow.\n\nTo contain the outbreak, the U.S. government is requiring dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu.\n\nWHEN DID THIS BIRD FLU OUTBREAK START?\n\nU.S. officials had thought the outbreak was recent, but new information suggests it may have started late last year.\n\nA study funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC published this month found bird flu was likely circulating on a limited basis as far back as late 2023. The study said it believed wild birds transmitted the virus to cattle, which then expanded when the cows were shipped to other states.\n\nHOW IS H5N1 SPREADING?\n\nIt remains unclear how the virus is spreading, but there is evidence of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and one case of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, officials reiterated.\n\nBecause of the heavy viral load in milk and mammary glands, scientists suspect the virus is being spread to animals during the milking process, either through contact with infected equipment or with virus that becomes aerosolized during cleaning procedures.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the virus can spread through respiratory droplets that infect the airway, as flu viruses typically spread in humans.\n\nA nasal swab from the Michigan worker tested negative for influenza in a state lab. But an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the CDC said, indicating it may have been transmitted in that way.\n\nIS THERE A BIRD FLU VACCINE FOR HUMANS?\n\nThe U.S. has a stockpile of bird flu vaccines matched with the strain currently circulating, as well as antivirals that could be used to treat human infections. For a major epidemic or a pandemic, the U.S. would have to scale up considerably.\n\nLast week, the U.S. government started manufacturing approximately 4.8 million doses of vaccine matched to the currently circulating strain of H5N1, a U.S. official said.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_droplet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory droplet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammary gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal cavity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEK3O116_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1389}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This is the second case associated with an ongoing multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) in dairy cows.[i] As with the case in Texas, the individual is a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows. While a nasal swab from the person tested negative for influenza in Michigan, an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus, indicating an eye infection. Similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms. CDC has been watching influenza surveillance systems closely, particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance.\n\nBased on the information available, this infection does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low. However, this development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\n\nCase Background\n\nA dairy worker who was being monitored because of their work exposure to H5N1-infected cattle reported symptoms to local health officials. Two specimens were collected from the patient. An upper respiratory tract specimen collected from the worker's nose was negative for influenza virus at the state health department laboratory. The eye specimen was sent to CDC for testing because it is one of a few labs where those specimens can be used with the CDC A(H5) test. The specimen was received by CDC and testing results confirmed A(H5) virus infection. The nasal specimen was retested at CDC and confirmed to be negative for influenza. The state was then notified of the results. The designation of the influenza virus neuraminidase (the N in the subtype) is pending genetic sequencing at CDC. Attempts to sequence the virus in the clinical specimen are underway and will be made available within 1-2 days if successful. Additional genetic analysis will look for any changes to the virus that could alter the agency's risk assessment.\n\nConjunctivitis (eye infection) has been associated with previous human infections with avian influenza A viruses and is part of the current CDC case definition for A(H5N1) surveillance. While it's not known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures, it may be from contamination of the eye(s), potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eye(s) with something contaminated with A(H5N1) virus, such as a hand. High levels of A(H5N1) virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows.\n\nCDC Activities\n\nThis case was detected through the state's implementation of CDC's recommended monitoring and testing strategies in exposed persons. In addition to enhanced and targeted surveillance, CDC also has:\n\nHeld numerous weekly engagements with state and local HDs around increasing their preparedness postureUpdated interim recommendations for worker protection to include those who work with dairy cowsIssued a Health Alert Notice (HAN) on identification of human infection and recommendations for investigations/responseHeld a call with states asking them to move from preparedness to readinessUpdated interim recommendations for worker protection to include those who work in slaughterhousesConducted numerous calls with groups representing farmworkersAsked states to furnish PPE for farmworkersAnnounced incentives for workers who participate in public health research efforts into the outbreakAsked states to work with clinical labs to increase submissions of positive influenza virus samples to public health labs for subtyping\n\nGiven the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified. Sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.\n\nCDC RecommendationsPeople should avoid close, long, or unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows).People should also avoid unprotected exposures to animal poop, bedding (litter), unpasteurized (\"raw\") milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed A(H5N1) virus. CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) virus infections in people. CDC also has updated recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE).Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person's risk and containing the overall public health risk.\n\nMore information is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm.\n\n[1] first human case of A(H5N1) bird flu in the United States linked to an outbreak in dairy cows was also the first likely case of human infection with A(H5N1) from a cow globally. This was reported on April 1, 2024. The person reported eye redness as their only symptom, consistent with conjunctivitis, and recovered. Learn more about this case in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine titled Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Infection in a Dairy Farm Worker. The April 1 case was actually the second human case of A(H5N1) reported in the United States. The first human case of A(H5N1) bird flu in the United States was reported in 2022 in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in depopulating poultry with presumptive A(H5N1) bird flu. The 2022 human case was not related to dairy cattle. The person only reported fatigue without any other symptoms and recovered.

The child acquired the avian influenza A (H5N1) infection while in India, and was unwell in March this year,\" 9news.com.au said quoting state health officials.\n\n\"A human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection, also known as \"bird flu\", has been reported in Victoria. There is no evidence of transmission in Victoria and the chance of additional human cases is very low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people,\" the Victorian Department of Health posted on X.\n\n\"The recently reported case was in a child who returned to Australia from overseas in March 2024. The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery,\" it said in another post without identifying the foreign country.\n\nThe case was announced hours after bird flu was detected on a farm in Victoria, 9news.com.au said.\n\n\"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,\" the Victoria Health said in a statement and added, that the child reportedly experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell.\n\n\"The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that take place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system,\" the news portal said quoting health officials.\n\nVictoria Health said the child was the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first detected case of the H5N1 strain in the country. A different strain of bird flu was detected on the Victorian egg farm after several poultry deaths.\n\n\"While the human case detected today is the H5N1 strain, the strain on the farm was found to be a different H7N7 variety,\" the report said.\n\nA report in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said, \"Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case. The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases are 'very low'.\" Humans are not at risk from this virus unless they had contact with infected birds or animals or their secretions. \"Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,\" the officials added.\n\nElaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there.\n\nThe property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak.\n\nBird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Caribbean", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Caribbean", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/Apr/1713436031_bird.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases are 'very low'.\"\n\nHumans are not at risk from this virus unless they had contact with infected birds or animals or their secretions. \"Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,\" the officials added.\n\nElaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there.\n\nThe property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak.\n\nBird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.",

months after the first one as an outbreak of the disease circulates widely among dairy cows.\n\nBoth individuals infected with the virus called H5N1 -- the first in Texas, the second in Michigan -- were dairy farm workers who suffered only minor symptoms and have recovered, according to authorities.\n\nDespite the second infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its risk assessment for the general public remained \"low,\" but it did suggest it expects more cases.\n\nGiven the high levels of the virus \"in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,\" the CDC said.\n\nHowever, \"sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the US general public, which CDC considers to be low.\"\n\nThe latest case in Michigan was detected in \"a worker on a dairy farm where H5N1 virus has been identified in cows,\" the CDC said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Health and Human Services, the worker had only mild symptoms and has recovered.\n\nTwo specimens were collected from the worker -- one from the nose and the other from the eye -- with only the eye specimen testing positive.\n\nAdditionally, \"similar to the Texas case, the patient only reported eye symptoms,\" the CDC said.\n\nMore from this section DEC says it's

infected birds or other animals (including livestock)... are at greater risk of infection,\" the CDC said.\n\nThough the current H5N1 strain has killed millions of poultry during the present wave, affected cows have not fallen severely sick.\n\nCows and goats joined the list of victims in March, surprising experts because the animals were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.\n\nVirus fragments have meanwhile been found in pasteurized milk, but health authorities say milk sold in US stores is safe because pasteurization effectively kills the disease.\n\nThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at present but health officials fear that if the virus were to eventually spread widely it could mutate into a form that could pass between humans.\n\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.\n\nla-bfm/dw", "source":

past two years have seen an increase in the frequency and spread of the virus among both birds and mammals.\n\nAccording to the WHO, in 2022, 67 countries across five continents experienced outbreaks of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza, resulting in the loss of over 131 million domestic poultry through death or culling.\n\nIn 2023, 14 additional countries, mainly in the Americas, reported

worried that the virus may combine with a human flu virus and mutate, which may make transmission between humans possible; the outbreaks could then turn into a mega pandemic.\n\nThis year, the US saw a widespread outbreak of the disease in dairy cows, and a case was also confirmed in a farm worker in Texas who later recovered from the infection.\n\nIn India this year so far, at least four cases of HPAI have been reported among poultry in Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, but there is no official word on whether mammals in close proximity to infected birds have been tested for the presence of the pathogen.\n\nThe only confirmed human case of bird flu was reported in India in 2021 in a 21-year-old boy from Haryana, who succumbed to the infection.", "source": {"uri":

The person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low, officials said.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported eye inflammation and was treated with an antiviral drug.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species - including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises - in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored.\n\nThis 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. On Wednesday, May 22, 2024, Michigan health officials said a farmworker has been diagnosed with bird flu, the second human case connected to an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP)\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what\u00b4s known as Type A H5N1 virus.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBut four years into COVID, and with bird flu spreading largely undetected in U.S. dairy cattle for months now, he says he's appalled governments aren't doing similar surveillance for potential pandemic viruses.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We know that forest fires are going to happen. And so we make that investment,\" said Worobey, a Canadian who is a professor and department head of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona.\n\nBut with the biological version of a forest fire, \"where these viruses can spread like wildfire through animals and people -- we're still basically just flying blind,\" said Worobey. And the result, he said, is now \"a raging conflagration that is already spread across most of the United States.\"\n\nAcross the world this year, disease experts like Worobey are focused on the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. The H5N1 virus, which has long been singled out for its potential as a threat to humans, may never develop into a global pandemic on the scale of COVID -- but, the experts say, governments have so far been too slow to respond to a very real risk.\n\nAnd even if the next globe-sweeping pathogen is not bird flu, they say, a key lesson of COVID is that the best time to fight a forest fire is before it takes off.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Bird flu in the U.S. You might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe H5N1 virus wasn't detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. until March of this year, about four months after Worobey estimates it was first passed from a bird to a single dairy cow, and then spread through the herds.\n\nIt took another month for the United States Department of Agriculture to release samples of the virus, which Worobey and his team used to piece together the molecular clock that could tell them the date of that first transmission.\n\nSince the initial discovery, bird flu has since been confirmed in 49 herds in nine states.\n\nThe response has been far slower than with COVID, said Worobey. \"There was a full genome sequence in COVID within about a day of people realizing in Wuhan that there was probably a new viral epidemic.\"\n\nCanada, like the U.S., has been slow to react, said Worobey.\n\nThe government announced a month after bird flu was detected in U.S. cows that it would require dairy cattle imported from the U.S. to test negative for the flu. Around the same time, it said it would begin conducting tests of retail milk for viral fragments. (The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that 142 samples of retail milk tested negative for fragments of bird flu.)\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Canada is certainly no better in terms of preparing in advance for the certainty that there's going to be outbreaks in animals that could then have pandemic potential,\" Worobey said.\n\nIn an email, Health Canada said that \"based on current scientific evidence, the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low.\"\n\nFor now, there is no suggestion that bird flu is being spread in cattle by respiratory droplets -- an important distinction when identifying its potential for pandemic transmission.\n\nInstead, scientists believe that the virus, which is found in greater concentrations in a cow's udder, is being spread through animals coming in contact with the virus in milking equipment.\n\nThe virus causes mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which affects milk production; the milk of infected cows appears curdled and is thrown out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in early May that tests confirmed that pasteurization is effective at killing any live virus.\n\nThere is a risk, however low, that bird flu can spread to farm workers who touch infected animals, as it did in April in Texas, where a worker's eye became inflamed due to the virus.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe CDC recommended last week that state health departments in the U.S. work with their agriculture counterparts to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers on dairy farms, poultry farms and in slaughterhouses.\n\nA number of infectious disease experts are also calling for the development of more specific vaccines for birds, animals and humans.\n\nScaling up production of human vaccines against the new H5N1 variants \"seems imperative,\" a group of researchers wrote in a paper that ran in the April edition of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, \"primarily to protect high-risk individuals such as farm workers against infection, but also for stockpiling, and secondly to increase preparedness should the virus evolve to sustained human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nA new variant of a well-known threat\n\nBird flu is not new.\n\nIn the late '90s, an outbreak in Hong Kong in chickens jumped into humans, infecting 18 people and causing six deaths. In the following years, there have been other small outbreaks with similarly high mortality rates.\n\nIn the last couple of years, however, the virus has spread to affect more wild birds than ever before.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt has continued to jump from wild birds to domestic poultry, where it can cause severe disease and death. Millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nAnd for the first time, the current subvariant of H5N1 has shown a propensity to jump to mammals \"and in some cases likely transmit mammal to mammal,\" Worobey said -- \"We've seen that in mink. We saw that in sea lions.\"\n\nBut \"we've never seen it in something like cattle, which are terrestrial mammals that we have very, very close interactions with, every day, directly and indirectly through their product,\" said Worobey.\n\nAs of last summer, the virus had affected at least 26 species, according to a statement by the World Health Organization. At the time of the statement, WHO recommended that given the unprecedented spread of the avian influenza virus among birds and mammals, and the potential risk to humans, that countries enhance biosecurity measures on farms, rapidly detect and report animal outbreaks and strengthen influenza surveillance in animals and humans.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. has a limited stockpile of H5N1 vaccines that target earlier strains of the virus and were made using traditional egg-based vaccine manufacturing.\n\nWork has already started on mRNA vaccines -- first used in COVID -- against bird flu at the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Drew Weissman, a physician and immunologist, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on mRNA vaccine research with Katalin Karik\u00f3, an adjunct professor of neurosurgery, also at Penn.\n\nThe vaccines can take as little as a month to create, said Weissman, compared to nine months for more traditional vaccines. The University of Pennsylvania has been developing mRNA vaccine technology for use in animals for at least seven years and inoculation of cows was expected to begin this week. The work being done is in the research phase and there is no vaccine approved for animals by the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWeissman said the goal was eventually to develop an mRNA vaccine against bird flu for humans.\n\n\"Certainly for cows, and farm workers who work with the cows, I think they need to be immunized,\" said Weissman.\n\nBut developing a vaccine takes money.\n\nWeissman said it costs $1.5 million just to make a vaccine and another $700,000 U.S. to do a toxicity study to understand elements such as potential adverse effects and safe dosages. That work has to be submitted to the FDA before clinical trials can start.\n\nCanada has two H5N1 pandemic vaccines -- authorized before mRNA technology came into use -- but they are currently not available.\n\nThe vaccine production process in this country is triggered by the World Health Organization.\n\nWHO would have to make a pandemic influenza declaration, or a recommendation that influenza vaccine manufacturers switch from seasonal to pandemic influenza vaccine, before production would start, said Health Canada in an email.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe government has agreements in place with several vaccine manufacturers -- domestic and international -- to ensure timely access to pandemic influenza vaccines for the entire Canadian population, according to the email, and has proactively met with GSK, the manufacturer that would make the vaccine, as well as other manufacturers, to discuss preparedness activities.", "source": {"uri":

It's likely not new.\"\n\nH7N7 was the most common strain of bird flu in Australia, Mr. Cooke said.\n\nOne of the strains in the last bird flu outbreak in Australia in 2020, which affected one-in-three egg farms in Victoria, was a H7 strain.\n\nSamples of the virus have been sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong for further testing.\n\n\"Agriculture Victoria is responding with staff on the ground supporting the business with further laboratory investigations as necessary,\" Mr. Cooke said.\n\nThe property has been placed into quarantine with a 5km radius and several hundred thousands of birds at that business will be \"depopulated\", he said.\n\n\"If this disease is allowed to spread, it would very much have an effect on the economic life of the poultry sector but there's also a lot of jobs in rural Victoria which are related to the industry,\" Dr Cooke said.\n\nAustralia's Chief Veterinary Officer Beth Cookson told AAP authorities are still considering the size of the quarantine area.\n\n\"The response will attempt to stamp out and eradicate the virus from the affected farm, so that will mean the destruction of the poultry on that premises,\" Ms. Cookson said.\n\nThe outbreak has put farmers on high alert with extra biosecurity measures in place.\n\n\"For those within that area, we would encourage everyone to increase their level of biosecurity on their farms,\" Ms. Cookson said.\n\nMary Wu from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation said while the disease appeared to be confined to a single egg farm, meat producers were on alert.\n\n\"We are very relieved that it's not the international strain, but we still take it extremely seriously and are acting very quickly,\" Ms. Wu said.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.\n\nWild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or contaminated environments.\n\nAuthorities have reassured the public that eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.", "source":

The worker had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low, officials said.\n\nThe first case was found in late March, when a farm worker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported eye inflammation and was treated with an antiviral drug.\n\nA nasal swab from the patient of this most recent case tested negative for influenza in Michigan. But an eye swab was shipped to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus, indicating an eye infection.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colo. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

the outbreak poses no risk to human health.\n\nRowan McMonnies, CEO of Australian Eggs, assured the public that only a \"small part of the industry is affected,\" and efforts are underway to ensure

virus has also spread to mammals, including humans.\n\nInfected people have observed mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic but some have experienced severe illness.\n\nBird flu could cause the next pandemic in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control has warned, as the H5N1 strain spreading on farms continued to mutate.\n\nIn a report published earlier this month, the agency said avian flu viruses 'have pandemic potential' in a section about rolling out vaccines if there is a human spillover.\n\nA Texas dairy farm worker who caught bird flu from a cow suffered 'very mild' symptoms, but the virus caused blood vessels in his eyes to pop, leading to bleeding on the surface of his eyeballs.\n\nAgriculture Victoria on Wednesday confirmed the presence of avian influenza after a number of poultry deaths at an egg farm near Meredith (pictured), about 40km north-west of Geelong\n\nThe man is only the second person to be diagnosed with bird flu in the US, and the first globally thought to

birds.\n\nDr Vivien Dugan, who directs the CDC's flu division, insisted that the risk to the general public was still 'low'.\n\nBut she said repeated infections in cattle suggested the virus could

The CDC highlights that despite the spread of H5N1 among dairy herds, the risk to the general public remains low. The USDA is enforcing stricter testing to curb transmission.\n\nA second human case of bird flu has been confirmed in the United States since the virus was first detected in dairy cattle in late March, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday. The infection of a dairy worker in Michigan expands the outbreak of the H5N1 virus, though the CDC said the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nA Texas dairy worker was confirmed to be infected in April. Michigan and Texas are among nine states that have reported bird flu in dairy herds. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples.\n\nSimilar to the Texas case, the patient in Michigan only reported eye symptoms, the CDC said. The Michigan worker had mild symptoms and recovered, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services. The worker had regular exposure to livestock infected with bird flu, Michigan said.\n\nThe CDC said \"similar additional human cases could be identified\" given high levels of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread in dairy cows. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus among cows, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads.\n\nTo limit transmission in cattle, the USDA in late April started requiring dairy cows to test negative before being shipped across state lines. \"It's likely that there will be several cases that emanate from exposure to infected cows and their milk amongst farm workers,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the John Hopkins Center for Health security.\n\n\"The key thing is to make sure that testing is wide enough to capture them.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amesh_Adalja", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amesh Adalja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_23_10_1033124.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia. The case occurred in a child, who acquired the infection in India and was unwell in March 2024. The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system. Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case.\n\nThere are lots of different subtypes (strains) of avian influenza. Most of them don't infect humans. Some subtypes, including H5N1, are more likely to cause disease and death in poultry. These are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Significant outbreaks of HPAI viruses are being reported in poultry and non-poultry birds and mammals overseas. The United States of America is currently experiencing outbreaks of HPAI (H5N1) in dairy cows, with one recent human case in a dairy worker. Whilst the Victorian case is HPAI (H5N1), it is not the same as the strains that have caused these outbreaks in the United States of America.\n\nThe Department of Health is supporting Agriculture Victoria in responding to an outbreak of avian influenza among birds at a poultry farm in regional Victorian. Testing has confirmed this outbreak is not related to this human case.\n\nTransmission to humans is very rare, with a small number of human cases of H5N1 reported globally, resulting in death in a number of cases. This is the first confirmed human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first time the H5N1 strain has been detected in a person or animal in Australia.\n\nThe seasonal flu vaccine doesn't protect against avian influenza. However, it can help prevent the mixing of highly pathogenic avian influenza with seasonal influenza, which can lead to new mutated viruses that could spread rapidly. This highlights the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination, particularly for poultry workers and those travelling to areas with outbreaks, to reduce the risk of new human pandemic viruses emerging.\n\nThe transmission of avian influenza from birds or animals to humans is very rare. Most people are not at risk, unless they have contact with infected birds or animals, or their secretions, while in affected areas of the world. Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can be spread easily from human to human. In this case, contact tracing has identified that there is no evidence of onwards spread to people.\n\nThe symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever, cough, headache, aching muscles and respiratory symptoms. Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes.\n\nAvian influenza is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive), e.g. handling infected birds, touching droppings or bedding, or killing/preparing infected poultry for cooking. You can't catch avian influenza through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of avian influenza.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Since then it has led to intermittent cases of avian flu in humans. It has also steadily infected more species - from raccoons and foxes to seals and sealions to, most recently, dairy cattle in the US. Between January 1st, 2003, and December 21st, 2023, 882 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus were reported from 23 countries, of which 52 per cent were fatal.\n\nAn editorial in this month's Lancet Infectious Diseases certainly thinks so and has a clear warning: \"The increasing host range of the virus, [its] potential spread among mammals and between a mammal and a human, its wide geographical spread, and the unprecedented scale of the outbreaks in birds, raise concerns about the pandemic potential (of H5N1),\" it says.\n\nAnd a recently published international survey of leading scientists found that some 57 per cent of disease experts now think that a strain of flu virus will be the cause of the next global outbreak to follow Covid-19. The belief that influenza is the world's greatest pandemic threat is based on long-term research showing it is constantly evolving and mutating, said study author Jon Salmanton-Garc\u00eda of University of Cologne.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has also weighed in. Last month it raised fears about the alarming spread of the H5N1 strain of influenza that is causing millions of cases of avian flu across the globe. The H5N1 variant has become \"a global zoonotic animal pandemic\", UN health agency's chief scientist Jeremy Farrar told reporters in Geneva. \"The great concern, of course, is that in . . . infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human.\"\n\nHis colleague, Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, is a little more measured in his response. \"Nobody is suggesting that H5N1 is the new next pandemic. I don't believe anybody can predict that. But it's certainly concerning when a virus like this begins to infect multiple mammalian species, which means the virus is adapting to [animals] that are more like us than birds, and therefore there's a higher level of alert.\"\n\nThe virus likely spilt from birds into cows as far back as late 2023, and spread undetected among cattle for months before the first cases were reported this March. It has been detected in unpasteurised cows' milk. An analysis of a recent case of a cattle worker infected in Texas outlined how the worker was in close contact with H5N1-infected dairy cattle, and developed eye inflammation and broken blood vessels as a result. Significantly, the virus identified in the worker's specimen had a genetic change that is associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts.\n\nBut there is no sign yet of an adaptation that would allow this virus to better bind to human-specific receptors in the upper airway, which would give it the ability to transmit easily between people. However, the more a virus spreads the chances of it mutating to infect humans increases.\n\nYes, there are two H5N1 vaccine formulations already available that could be used in a pandemic. There are two types of injections that are well matched with the currently circulating strain in dairy cattle.\n\nBut there is no need to begin manufacturing these shots now, the WHO's Dr Ryan says. Scaling up to produce pandemic vaccines would mean a trade-off where manufacturers are forced to stop producing annual shots for our seasonal strains of flu.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Host (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raccoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cologne", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Cologne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/9OEieEjcAcW92rKhE6W5AuWWvmk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/ENQJCAB4BVEXZIMBJD3ZRBN3DI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-01-01", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 444}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nMichigan and Texas are among nine states that have reported bird flu in dairy herds since late March.\n\nScientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on US Food and Drug Administration findings of H5N1 particles in about 20 per cent of retail milk samples.\n\nSimilar to the Texas case, the patient in Michigan only reported eye symptoms, the CDC said.\n\nThe Michigan worker had mild symptoms and recovered, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe worker had regular exposure to livestock infected with bird flu, Michigan said.\n\nThe CDC said \"similar additional human cases could be identified\" given high levels of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread in dairy cows.\n\nNirav Shah, CDC's principal deputy director, said the agency received the Michigan patient sample on Tuesday and confirmed the positive test result that evening.\n\nThe CDC said the investigation is just getting underway, and investigators are looking into whether the worker was wearing or was offered protective equipment.\n\nA nasal swab from the Michigan worker tested negative for influenza in the state but an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the CDC said.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it believes unpasteurised milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus among cows although officials do not know exactly how it spreads.\n\nTo limit transmission in cattle, the USDA in late April started requiring dairy cows to test negative before being shipped across state lines.\n\n\"It's likely that there will be several

This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new.\"\n\nH7N7 was the most common strain of bird flu in Australia, Cooke said.\n\nOne of the strains in the last bird flu outbreak in Australia in 2020, which affected one-in-three egg farms in Victoria, was an H7 strain.\n\nSamples of the virus have been sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong for further testing.\n\n\"Agriculture Victoria is responding with staff on the ground supporting the business with further laboratory investigations as necessary,\" Cooke said.\n\nThe property has been placed into quarantine with a 5km radius and several hundred thousands of birds at that business will be \"depopulated\", he said.\n\n\"If this disease is allowed to spread, it would very much have an effect on the economic life of the poultry sector but there's also a lot of jobs in rural Victoria which are related to the industry.\"\n\nAustralia's chief veterinary officer Beth Cookson told AAP authorities are still considering the size of the quarantine area.\n\n\"The response will attempt to stamp out and eradicate the virus from the affected farm, so that will mean the destruction of the poultry on that premises,\" Cookson said.\n\nThe outbreak has put farmers on high alert with extra biosecurity measures in place.\n\n\"For those within that area, we would encourage everyone to increase their level of biosecurity on their farms,\" Cookson said.\n\nMary Wu from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation said while the disease appeared to be confined to a single egg farm, meat producers were on alert.\n\n\"We are very relieved that it's not the international strain, but we still take it extremely seriously and are acting very quickly.\"\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.\n\nWild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or contaminated environments.\n\nAuthorities have reassured the public that eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType":

At least 14 cats have recently died of bird flu.\n\nOf the newly reported cases, two were domestic cats which died at a property in Campbell County in South Dakota, according to a state official and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nBeth Thompson, the state's veterinarian, said there was no livestock on the property where the pets died. \"No other details regarding how the cats were infected are known at this time,\" Thompson told BNO News.\n\nTwo other cases were recently reported in Michigan, one in Isabella County and the other in Ionia County. Both cases involved barn cats on commercial dairy farms where cows were also infected with H5N1.\n\nAt the property in Ionia County, two Virginia opossums were also infected with the bird flu virus.\n\n\"Cats are particularly susceptible to H5N1 2.3.4.4b viruses and the majority of sick cats have been reported at or near affected poultry facilities or dairies,\" Shilo Weir, a spokesperson for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told BNO News.\n\nAt least 14 cats in the United States have died of H5N1 bird flu since the virus was confirmed in dairy cows in late March. The real number of infected cats is believed to be higher due to limited testing.\n\nEarlier this month, officials confirmed that a domestic cat in Montana was also infected with H5N1 after exhibiting \"neurologic signs\" and the discovery of a dead skunk on the property. It's unclear if the skunk was also infected.\n\nThe global spread of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b - and the recent spread to a growing number of mammals - has raised concern about the possibility of human-to-human transmission from a future variant though, so far, only a few human cases have been found after contact with infected birds or cattle.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced in late March that bird flu had been found in dairy cows in Kansas and Texas, making those the first-ever cases in cattle. The number of outbreaks at dairy farms has since risen to 51 in 9 states and a farm worker in Texas also tested positive.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC asked state health departments to continue influenza surveillance at enhanced levels throughout the summer to help detect potential cases of bird flu in the community. More samples will also be submitted for subtyping to help distinguish between seasonal flu and H5N1.\n\n\"CDC is committed to supporting state and local public health officials and will continue to provide information to support their H5N1 influenza response efforts,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. government announced nearly $200 million in funding to fight the spread of H5N1 bird flu in dairy cows, including support for dairy farms, testing, vaccine development, surveillance and measures to ensure the safety of commercial milk.\n\nCats are known to be highly vulnerable to this new strain of H5N1 bird flu. The first case in a cat with this variant was reported near a duck farm in southern France in December 2022, after which the animal was euthanized.\n\nIn 2023, nearly 40 cats died at two animal shelters in South Korea after eating contaminated cat food, and in Poland, more than a dozen cats died in an outbreak presumably caused by contaminated raw meat.\n\nIn the United States, at least 27 cats have now been infected with H5N1 bird flu, including the 14 cases reported in recent weeks. The other 13 happened last year in connection with infected poultry or wild birds.", "source": {"uri": "rsoe-edis.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "rsoe-edis.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

A different strain, H7, was detected at an egg farm near Melbourne. Authorities are imposing curbs to prevent further spread and impact on the poultry industry.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of avian influenza on Wednesday in a child who authorities said had been infected in India but made a full recovery, while a different highly contagious strain was found on an egg farm. The H5N1 strain of avian flu has swept the globe in recent years, killing billions of farmed and wild birds and spreading to tens of mammal species.\n\nHealth authorities in Australia's southeastern state of Victoria said contact tracing had not identified any further cases and there was a very low chance of others becoming infected as the flu does not easily spread between people. \"This is the first confirmed human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia,\" Dr Claire Looker, the state's chief health officer, said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first instance of detection of the H5N1 strain in a person or animal in the country, she added. \"The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery.\"\n\nThe case in Victoria involves an H5N1 virus, but the strain is not the same as those responsible for outbreaks in the United States, Looker said. A farm worker in Texas tested positive for the virus earlier this year as it spread through the U.S. cattle herd.\n\nAustralia is the only continent where animals have so far stayed free of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but authorities on Wednesday said a different strain of highly pathogenic bird flu had been detected at an egg farm near Melbourne. First laboratory tests showed that virus was an as yet unidentified H7 strain that probably came from the wild bird population and had been seen in Australia before, said Graeme Cooke, Victoria's chief veterinary officer.\n\nCurbs were imposed on movement around the farm and the birds would be destroyed, he added. \"This area does have a high density of poultry businesses, both egg laying and poultry meat,\" Cooke told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio.\n\n\"At this stage we can't say whether there'll be any onward spread to other properties. We are now taking measures necessary to stamp it out to remove any onward spread.\" The outbreak presented no risk to human health, he said.\n\nOnly a small part of the industry has been affected, said Rowan McMonnies, chief executive of industry body Australian Eggs, adding that farmers would be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves\". Chicken producer Inghams Group plunged as much as 16% but pared losses to 5.5% by 0701 GMT after it said operations had not been affected.\n\nThe Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies had stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution but added, \"No discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level.\" In 2020, Victoria was the site of an H7N7 outbreak, the most recent of Australia's nine outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) since 1976. All were quickly reined in and stamped out, the government says.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_01_57_1514112.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

This discovery highlights the susceptibility of diverse avian populations to the virus.\n\nSubsequent investigations revealed additional cases, including a red-tailed hawk in Hunterdon County and a bald eagle in Cumberland County.\n\nThe bufflehead duck, known scientifically as Bucephala albeola, is a small sea duck commonly found foraging underwater. The presence of the virus in such species highlights the potential for transmission among diverse avian populations.\n\nAvian influenza, caused by the influenza A virus, poses a significant threat to both bird populations and, in some cases, humans. The strain detected in New Jersey, HPAI EA H5N1, is particularly concerning due to its high pathogenicity and potential for transmission to other species, including humans.\n\nWhile the risk of transmission to humans is generally low, close contact with infected birds or their environments can lead to severe illness, including pneumonia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize the importance of avoiding contact with sick or dead birds and practicing proper hygiene when handling poultry.\n\nThe good news is that, so far, H5N1 is not considered a major public health threat in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has categorized the risk to the general public as \"low,\" but continues to monitor the situation carefully.\n\n\"In the short term, there is very little threat,\" says Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD. \"In the long term, in the coming years or decades, however, I'm much more concerned.\" He gives two reasons: One is that there has been a mortality (or death) rate of about 50% in the almost 900 people around the world who have been infected with bird flu between 2003 and 2024.\n\nHowever, 50% may be an overestimate, Dr. Roberts says, adding that there may be cases where people have no symptoms, are only mildly symptomatic, or haven't sought care for their symptoms. He also noted that if the virus did spread in humans, the percentage might be significantly lower if preventive approaches, including a vaccine, and treatments were made widely available.\n\nAnother reason for concern is that bird flu is now being detected in new animal species. In addition to outbreaks in cows -- a relatively new development for the bird flu virus -- there have been sporadic infections in some wild mammals. \"It's natural to wonder if it's only a matter of time before this virus is able to spread among humans,\" Dr. Roberts says.\n\nDairy cows are a \"new and unexpected host\" of the H5N1 virus, and the spread of the virus among cows is a sign that it could mutate in them, making it easier for it to spread to other animals or potentially humans, according to the CDC.\n\nThe disease appears to be milder in cows, although this could make it more difficult to track, Dr. Roberts says. \"The virus is also infecting other animals,\" he adds. \"To me, that sounds like it's mutating to adapt, evolve, and infect new species.\"\n\nMany experts are concerned about the possibility of this virus infecting pigs at some point, because pigs can be infected with both human and animal flu viruses, adds Dr. Roberts. \"Then, we have this sort of mixing pot, where you can get a genetic reassortment of different flu strains. That's really the big, long-term concern that could take years or decades -- if it were to happen,\" he says.\n\nThe recent cases in New Jersey are part of a broader trend of avian influenza outbreaks nationwide. Federal agencies, including APHIS, are closely monitoring the situation and working to prevent further spread, particularly to domestic poultry populations.\n\nEfforts to mitigate the risk of transmission include early detection through surveillance programs, public awareness campaigns, and coordination with state and local authorities. Additionally, measures such as biosecurity protocols on farms and restrictions on the movement of poultry can help prevent outbreaks in commercial poultry operations.\n\nBird flu in the milk supply has been a major concern among consumers, but the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has been sampling retail milk and other dairy products, such as cottage cheese and sour cream, as well as powdered milk formula and powdered milk products sold as toddler formula; it reports that although dead byproducts of the virus have been present, it found no live infectious virus, thanks to pasteurization, a food production process of heating liquids for short periods of time to kill harmful bacteria.\n\nHowever, the FDA advises people not to drink, manufacture, or sell raw cow milk and products, such as cheeses, ice cream, and yogurt, made with raw milk. (Raw, unpasteurized milk and milk products are sold legally in most states.) While neither of the two human infections was linked to raw milk, more than half of a resident population of domestic cats on a farm in Texas died after they were fed raw, unpasteurized colostrum (milk produced during the first few days after birth) from H5N1-infected cows, according to a CDC report.\n\nThere also is no evidence that anyone in the U.S. has gotten bird flu after eating properly handled and cooked poultry products, but the CDC notes that uncooked poultry and poultry products (such as blood) may have caused a small number of H5N1 infections in people in Southeast Asia.\n\nPoultry and other animal foods should be safe to eat as long as they are prepared properly, according to the CDC. This includes cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F, which can kill viruses, including H5N1. (Use a food thermometer to be sure.) The FDA provides more information on raw milk on its website.\n\nAs investigations continue and additional cases may emerge, it is essential for authorities and the public to remain vigilant and take appropriate precautions to minimize the spread of avian influenza. By working together, stakeholders can mitigate the impact of these outbreaks on both wildlife and agricultural sectors.\n\nSince bird flu isn't spreading among humans, most people don't need to worry about precautions, Dr. Roberts says. But people who are exposed to cows or poultry, especially in states where bird flu has been identified, should consider them, he says. So should hunters who handle wild birds and people who raise chickens at home.\n\nOne problem is that experts are still learning how bird flu is transmitted. \"We understand much less about H5N1 transmission than we do about COVID,\" Dr. Roberts says. But most people infected with bird flu get it from unprotected contact with infected birds, according to the CDC. The agency adds that infection also can happen when people inhale the virus in droplets or dust from the infected animals, or touch a contaminated surface.\n\nThe CDC has a list of recommended precautions, including:\n\nIt's important to throw away your gloves and face mask after any exposure.\n\nCheck the CDC website for further advice for specific situations and groups, including hunters and people who raise chickens in their backyards. It also offers special advice for people who work with animals on farms.\n\nFor anyone who wants to keep up with the news about bird flu, the CDC is providing regular updates based on its flu surveillance systems.", "source": {"uri": "njtoday.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJTODAY.NET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufflehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bufflehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bald eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_hawk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red-tailed hawk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foraging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/njtoday.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ocean-County-bufflehead-ducks.jpg?fit=1210%2C680&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 416}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Public threat remains low, CDC says", "body": "Curious Holstein dairy cows feed on silage in a freestall barn at a dairy farm in San Joaquin Valley, California, USA. (Ed Young/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nA second dairy worker has tested positive for H5N1, the influenza A virus known as bird flu. The confirmed case involves a Michigan farmworker, the Michigan Department of Health announced on Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the risk to the public remains low and that the patient recovered with mild symptoms.\n\nThe farmworker in question was regularly exposed to dairy cows, which have been catching the virus as it has spread through dairy and poultry farms throughout the United States the last several months. Bird flu can be fatal, although it is usually treatable; its main symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle aches and fatigue. For the most part the disease is limited to animals like chickens and cows, as well as wild animals such as seals, although the infected Michigan farmworker is the third confirmed human patient in America since 2022 and the second that is related to the dairy industry.\n\n\"Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan,\" said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive, in a statement. \"Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available. The current health risk to the general public remains low.\"\n\nAustralian health authorities also announced on Wednesday that a human bird flu patient has been confirmed for the first time in their country. The case is not related to dairy farms and authorities have said it originated in India. The patient, a child, recovered without spreading the disease to others.\n\nThe biggest difficulty in containing the bird flu outbreak is that many states do not thoroughly regulate their agricultural sectors. Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Ark., told Salon last month that testing is still mostly voluntary. Rajnarayanan urged comprehensive guidelines on what both cattle ranchers and ordinary citizens needs to know.\n\n\"Mandatory tests for cattle that are transported is a welcome move.

size of the quarantine area.\n\n\"The response will attempt to stamp out and eradicate the virus from the affected farm, so that will mean the destruction of the poultry on that premises,\" Dr Cookson said.\n\nThe outbreak has put farmers on high alert with extra biosecurity measures in place.\n\n\"For those within that area, we would encourage everyone to increase their level of biosecurity on their farms,\" Dr Cookson said.\n\nMary Wu from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation said while the disease appeared to be confined to a single egg farm, meat producers were on alert.\n\n\"We are very relieved that it's not the international strain, but we still take it extremely seriously and are acting very quickly,\" Dr Wu said.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.\n\nWild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or

(WOOD) -- Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in a Michigan resident, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday.\n\nAccording to MDHHS, the person diagnosed with influenza A (H5) worked on a farm and was regularly exposed to infected livestock. The person had minor eye symptoms and has recovered, the department says. It did not release any further details about the person or the farm.\n\nA nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive, \"indicating an eye infection,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.\n\nThe Michigan case seems to be \"a sporadic infection with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person,\" according to the department.\n\nThe first dairy-related case happened in late March when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also reported only eye inflammation and recovered. In 2022, before the virus had been detected among cows, a prison inmate in Colorado got sick while killing infected birds at a poultry farm. The only symptom he experienced was fatigue, officials said, and he recovered.\n\n\"Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan. Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available,\" said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive, in a statement. \"The current health risk to the general public remains low. This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the month, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring issued a \"Determination of Extraordinary Emergency\" order, requiring dairy farms and commercial poultry farms to take extra steps to combat avian flu.\n\n\"Since the first detection of influenza A (H5N1) in dairy cattle on March 29, Michigan has prioritized both the animal and human health aspects of this disease outbreak,\" Boring stated Wednesday. \"Today's news underscores the continued importance of limiting nonessential farm visits, including farm tours and field trips, as well as the use of personal protective equipment when working with livestock.\"",

We are now taking measures necessary to stamp it out to remove any onward spread.\"\n\nThe outbreak presented no risk to human health, he said.\n\nOnly a small part of the industry has been affected, said Rowan McMonnies, CEO of industry body Australian Eggs, adding that farmers would be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves\".\n\nChicken producer Inghams Group plunged as much as 16% but pared losses to 5.5% by 7.01am GMT after it said operations had not been affected.\n\nThe Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies had stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution but added: \"No discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level\".\n\nIn 2020, Victoria was the site of an H7N7 outbreak, the most recent of Australia's nine outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) since 1976.

The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes.", "source": {"uri": "zeebiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Otter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.zeebiz.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/22/295094-bird-flu-us.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The infection of a dairy worker in Michigan expands the outbreak of the bird flu, though the CDC said the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe CDC told reporters on a call that it has not seen evidence of human to human transmission of bird flu and that it has tested close to 40 people since March, including the Michigan worker. A Texas dairy worker was confirmed to be infected in April.\n\nMichigan and Texas are among nine states that have reported bird flu in dairy herds since late March. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Similar to the Texas case, the patient in Michigan only reported eye symptoms, the CDC said. The Michigan worker had mild symptoms and recovered, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe worker had regular exposure to livestock infected with bird flu, Michigan said. The CDC said \"similar additional human cases could be identified\" given high levels of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread in dairy cows.\n\nNirav Shah, CDC's principal deputy director, said the agency received the Michigan patient sample on Tuesday and confirmed the positive test result that evening. The CDC said the investigation is just getting underway, and investigators are looking into whether the worker was wearing or was offered protective equipment. A nasal swab from the Michigan worker tested negative for influenza in the state, but an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the CDC said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus among cows, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. To limit transmission in cattle, the USDA in late April started requiring dairy cows to test negative before being shipped across state lines.\n\n\"It's likely that there will be several cases that emanate from exposure to infected cows and their milk amongst farm workers,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the John Hopkins Center for Health security. \"The key thing is to make sure that testing is wide enough to capture them.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amesh_Adalja", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amesh Adalja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_22_28_337697.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It is a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages.\n\nYes. Bird flu does not usually infect people, but there have been some people who have caught the virus through exposure to sick or dead animals.\n\nBird flu was first detected in 1996 among birds in China, according to the CDC. One year later, an outbreak in Hong Kong resulted in 18 human cases, including six deaths, after people were infected directly by birds.\n\nIn late 2021, a version of the virus arrived on the shores of the U.S. and was found in wild birds. Since February 2022, the virus has caused outbreaks in commercially raised poultry, including chickens and turkeys. That has led to the deaths or the culling of more than 90 million birds across the country, according to the USDA.\n\nBird flu has had a fatality rate of about 50% of the known cases in humans, according to the CDC.\n\nThere have been 861 human cases -- and 455 deaths -- reported from 17 countries from November 2003 to May 2019, according to the CDC.\n\nCDC health experts say because people have little immunity to this virus, it could cause a pandemic if the virus changes so that it can spread easily from person to person.\n\nSo far, the virus has not changed in a way that allows it to spread easily from one person to another. Scientists say it's possible that will never happen.\n\nBird flu is a respiratory virus. In humans, bird flu may cause illnesses similar to influenza (the flu) with fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and muscle aches. It can cause pneumonia and breathing problems, according to the CDC.\n\nSome people report no symptoms or mild symptoms such as eye redness.\n\nWhile still unlikely, people can get infected with bird flu by direct exposure to sick birds.\n\nInfected birds have avian flu virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. It can potentially spread to a person who touches a sick animal or contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. The virus can also potentially be spread when the virus is inhaled from droplets or dust in the air.\n\nThose who work closely with sick birds or other sick animals without personal protective equipment such as masks and eye protection face a higher risk of infection.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how dairy cows in the U.S. were first infected. One likely route is infected birds, which shed the virus in their feces, saliva and other secretions, contaminating cows' food or water.\n\nThe virus may now be spreading directly from cow to cow or through contaminated dairy equipment.\n\nIt also appears to be causing relatively mild illness in cows.\n\nThe reported cases of person-to-person spread are extremely rare and only involve transmission from a sick person to a close family member or caregiver.\n\nThere has never been a confirmed person-to-person transmission of bird flu in the U.S.\n\nTwo. There has only been one confirmed human case with the most recent outbreak in dairy cows: a person who worked directly with cows. That person reported mild illness and recovered. It's still not clear exactly how this person got sick.\n\nThe only previous human case in the U.S. occurred in Colorado in 2022 in a poultry worker. That worker recovered after experiencing fatigue.\n\n2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

He experienced mild eye symptoms and has recovered, U.S. and Michigan health officials said in announcing the case Wednesday.\n\nA nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested Tuesday was positive for bird flu, \"indicating an eye infection,\" U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said.\n\nThe worker developed a \"gritty feeling\" in his eye earlier this month but it was a \"very mild case,\" said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive. He was not treated with oseltamivir, a medication advised for treating bird flu, she said.\n\nThe risk to the public remains low, but farmworkers exposed to infected animals are at higher risk, health officials said. They said those workers should be offered protective equipment, especially for their eyes.\n\nHealth officials say they do not know if the Michigan farmworker was wearing protective eyewear, but an investigation is continuing.\n\nIn late March, a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported only eye inflammation and recovered.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries.\n\nThe detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan.\n\nThe CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah said the case was \"not unexpected\" and it's possible more infections could be diagnosed in people who work around infected cows.\n\nU.S. officials said they had tested 40 people since the first cow cases were discovered in late March. Michigan has tested 35 of them, Bagdasarian told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nShah praised Michigan officials for actively monitoring farmworkers. He said health officials there have been sending daily text messages to workers exposed to infected cows asking about possible symptoms, and that the effort helped officials catch this infection. He said no other workers had reported symptoms.\n\nThat's encouraging news, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist who has studied bird flu for decades. There's no sign to date that the virus is causing flu-like illness or that it is spreading among people.\n\n\"If we had four or five people seriously ill with respiratory illness, we would be picking that up,\" he said.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Human infections with avian influenza viruses can happen when the virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth or is inhaled, the CDC reports.\n\nThe reported signs and symptoms of bird flu virus infections in humans have ranged from no symptoms or mild illness -- such as eye redness or mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms -- to severe -- such as pneumonia requiring hospitalization -- and included fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures.\n\nAvian influenza viruses have been detected in other species -- mostly recently in dairy cattle.\n\nIn late March, a human case of this virus -- known as Type A H5N1 -- was identified in a Texas dairy worker exposed to infected cows who developed a mild eye infection and then recovered.\n\nAbout 33 people have been tested and another 260 are being monitored, according to the CDC.\n\nU.S. officials on Friday pledged nearly $200 million in new spending and other efforts to help track and contain this outbreak. The new funds include $101 million to continue work to prevent, test, track and treat animals and humans potentially affected by the virus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. Another $98 million of the funds will provide up to $28,000 each to help individual farms test cattle and bolster biosecurity efforts to halt the spread of the virus, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\nIn addition, dairy farmers will be compensated for the loss of milk production from infected cattle, whose supply drops dramatically when they become sick, officials said. And dairy farmers and farm workers would be paid to participate in a workplace study conducted by the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n*\n\nInformer is written by Crystal Stevenson, American Press executive editor.

This alarming discovery was only recently reported on the health site of the Victorian State Health Department, leading to widespread outrage and questions about the transparency of health authorities.\n\nCase Of Child In Australia Infected With H5N1 Two Months Ago After\n\nTrip To India Raise Concerns That Governments Are Concealing H5N1 Cases!\n\nThe Timeline of Concealment\n\nThe child in question returned from India in March 2024 and subsequently developed a severe infection. Despite the serious nature of the case, which involved a potentially deadly strain of avian influenza, the information was withheld from the public until now. This delay in reporting has sparked significant concern among experts, doctors, and the general public, who are questioning the motivations behind this lack of transparency.\n\nHealth Department's Explanation\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Dr. Clare Looker, Chief Health Officer of Victoria, the case was identified through enhanced surveillance systems that routinely test positive influenza samples for novel or concerning strains. The child, who experienced severe symptoms, has since made a full recovery. Contact tracing efforts have not identified any further cases connected to this incident, suggesting that the risk of transmission in Victoria remains low.\n\nhttps://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-advisories/human-case-of-avian-influenza-bird-flu-detected-in-returned-traveller-to-victoria\n\nHowever, the decision to delay public notification has raised questions about the integrity of the health department's reporting practices. Critics argue that concealing such critical information could have jeopardized the safety of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe Global Context of H5N1\n\nThe case in Victoria is set against a backdrop of a global avian influenza outbreak affecting birds and animals. While human cases of H5N1 are rare, they are not unheard of. The United States, for instance, has in various H5N1 News coverages, reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in dairy cows, with a recent human case in a dairy worker.\n\nIts coming to light that many governments and health authorities of various countries are concealing actual H5N1 infections involving humans and only highlight certain cases form time to time as per their agenda and even in such cases, the information released might not be true or accurate for instance can anyone validate that the migrant worker who was infected with H5N1 in a dairy farm in Texas really recovered and is still alive?\n\nThailand quot;https://www.thailandmedical.news/\">Medical News has been vocal about the potential underreporting of H5N1 cases globally and suggest that there are as many different reassortant strains of H5N1 that can affect humans already circulating, some naturally evolved and others potentially lab-created. These strains exhibit a wide range of symptoms, some strains only causing mild symptoms initially but affect the brain and CNS system over time and some strains that are extremely lethal such as those found in a military base in Chile in 2023, which were also allegedly concealed.\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/h5n1-avian-flu-news-coverup-of-h5n1-avian-flu-human-to-human-infections-involving-military-cadets-in-chile-s-valparaiso-region\n\nThe recent case of a H5N1 outbreak in Jharkahand State in India which Indian authorities later downplayed as being not H5N1 despite prevailing evidence is one of the many examples of H5N1 cases being concealed.\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-h5n1-human-outbreak-reported-in-ranchi-in-jharkhand-state-india-with-6-individuals-and-2-doctors-quarantined-in-a-makeshift-bird-flu-ward\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-cover-up-of-mystery-flu-outbreak-in-argentina-that-has-left-many-in-icu-is-more-than-just-possible-psittacosis-h5n1-suspected\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-russian-new-agency-claims-18-people-hospitalized-and-2-dead-from-h5n1-avian-flu-in-kherson,-ukraine-true,-propaganda-or-bioweapons\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/h5n1-news-argentina-reports-6-individuals-possibly-contracted-h5n1-avian-flu-manner-of-reporting-validates-that-many-governments-are-concealing-data\n\nImplications for Public Health\n\nThe first confirmed human case of H5N1 in Australia underscores the importance of transparency in public health reporting. The seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against avian influenza, but it can help prevent the mixing of highly pathogenic avian influenza with seasonal influenza, potentially leading to new, more virulent strains. This highlights the importance of seasonal flu vaccinations, especially for those in high-risk occupations such as poultry workers\n\nWho is at Risk?\n\nTransmission of avian influenza from birds or animals to humans is rare. Most people are not at risk unless they have direct contact with infected birds or their secretions. However, the potential for human-to-human transmission, while extremely rare, cannot be entirely dismissed. The symptoms of H5N1 infection can range from fever, cough, and headache to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes.\n\nRecommendations for the Public\n\nThe Victorian Department of Health advises individuals traveling to areas affected by avian influenza to avoid poultry farms and live bird markets, thoroughly wash their hands after handling birds or uncooked poultry products, and ensure poultry is fully cooked before consumption. Immunization against seasonal influenza is recommended for everyone aged six months and over to reduce the risk of new human pandemic viruses emerging.\n\nRecommendations for Health Professionals\n\nHealthcare providers are urged to consider avian influenza in patients presenting with compatible symptoms and risk factors, such as recent travel to affected areas. Diagnostic samples should be taken for influenza PCR and further typing in such cases. Health professionals should also educate travelers about the risks of avian influenza and encourage annual seasonal influenza vaccination, especially for those at higher risk of exposure.\n\nConclusion: A Call for Transparency\n\nThe delayed reporting of the H5N1 case in Victoria has highlighted significant gaps in public health communication. The concealment of such critical information not only undermines public trust but also raises serious questions about the true extent of the H5N1 threat. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing avian influenza outbreak, transparency and timely reporting are essential to ensure public safety and preparedness. The Victorian case serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and honesty in public health reporting to prevent potential pandemics and protect public health.\n\nFor the latest H5N1 News, keep on logging to Thailand Medical News.\n\nRead Also:\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/u-s-cdc-says-that-37-out-of-300-people-in-america-who-have-been-exposed-to-animals-infected-with-h5n1-have-developed-flu-like-symptoms", "source": {"uri": "thailandmedical.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Home -

He experienced mild eye symptoms and has recovered, U.S. and Michigan health officials said in announcing the case Wednesday.\n\nA nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested Tuesday was positive for bird flu, \"indicating an eye infection,\" U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said.\n\nThe worker developed a \"gritty feeling\" in his eye earlier this month but it was a \"very mild case,\" said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive. He was not treated with oseltamivir, a medication advised for treating bird flu, she said.\n\nThe risk to the public remains low, but farmworkers exposed to infected animals are at higher risk, health officials said. They said those workers should be offered protective equipment, especially for their eyes.\n\nHealth officials say they do not know if the Michigan farmworker was wearing protective eyewear, but an investigation is continuing.\n\nIn late March, a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported only eye inflammation and recovered.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan.\n\nThe CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah said the case was \"not unexpected\" and it's possible more infections could be diagnosed in people who work around infected cows.\n\nU.S. officials said they had tested 40 people since the first cow cases were discovered in late March. Michigan has tested 35 of them, Bagdasarian told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nShah praised Michigan officials for actively monitoring farmworkers. He said health officials there have been sending daily text messages to workers exposed to infected cows asking about possible symptoms, and that the effort helped officials catch this infection. He said no other workers had reported symptoms.\n\nThat's encouraging news, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist who has studied bird flu for decades. There's no sign to date that the virus is causing flu-like illness or that it is spreading among people.\n\n\"If we had four or five people seriously ill with respiratory illness, we would be picking that up,\" he said.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

We are now taking measures necessary to stamp it out to remove any onward spread.\"\n\nThe outbreak presented no risk to human health, he said.\n\nOnly a small part of the industry has been affected, said Rowan McMonnies, chief executive of industry body Australian Eggs, adding that farmers would be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves\".\n\nChicken producer Inghams Group plunged as much as 16% but pared losses to 5.5% by 0701 GMT after it said operations had not been affected.\n\nThe Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies had stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution but added, \"No discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level.\"\n\nIn 2020, Victoria was the site of an H7N7 outbreak, the most recent of Australia's nine outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) since 1976.

The farm has been placed under quarantine.\n\nThis comes after yesterday's announcement by the Victorian Department of Health that a child had made a full recovery after contracting the H5N1 virus overseas.\n\nThe egg farm preliminary results indicate that it is not the much feared highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b, according to a statement made by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.\n\nClade 2.3.4.4b has been spreading globally, causing widespread outbreaks in bird populations and even spreading to marine mammals, however it has not yet been detected in Australia.\n\nSamples from the affected farm have been delivered to the CSIRO's Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness at Geelong for further tests to determine the strain and whether it is a high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus.\n\nVictoria's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Graeme Cooke, told the ABC that the variant detected was H7N7.\n\nCooke says: \"poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners are urged to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888, or to your local vet.\"\n\nBob Doneley, a professor in avian and exotic pet service and a registered specialist in bird medicine at the University of Queensland, says: \"avian influenza viruses are classified by a combination of two groups of surface proteins: haemagglutinin or \"H\" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1 to H16), and neuraminidase or \"N\" proteins, of which there are nine (N1 to N9).\n\nMany different combinations of \"H\" and \"N\" proteins are possible - in fact, mathematically there are 170 different combinations possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains.\n\n\"Avian influenza viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity, low or high, based upon the ability of a particular virus strain to cause disease in chickens,\" Doneley says.\n\nAccording to Doneley, HPAI viruses in poultry are usually H5 or H7 subtypes of Type A influenza and the viral strain most likely to cause human disease and fatalities is H5N1.\n\nAssociate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake, a specialist in infectious diseases and associate professor of medicine at The Australian National University, says in Victoria, surveillance will have to be ramped up to identify other poultry populations infected with H7N7.\n\n\"Hopefully large culls won't be needed,\" Senanayake says. \"From a human health perspective, it is vital to terminate this H7N7 outbreak as soon as possible, otherwise more infections give the virus more opportunities to mutate.\n\n\"Infection from poultry to farmed pigs is of particular concern, as pigs can act as the perfect mixing pot of human and avian flu viruses, leading to a strain of flu that can then move between humans easily.\n\n\"Despite having \"COVID fatigue\" and not wanting to hear the word \"pandemic\" again, the next pandemic could be just around the corner, and a strain of bird flu is a likely candidate. Unlike the early days of COVD, at least with H5N1, there are already human vaccines and antivirals.\"", "source": {"uri": "cosmosmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmos Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Forestry_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CSIRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuraminidase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemagglutinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Queensland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geelong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geelong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian National University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1326159072-1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The worker had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low, officials said.\n\nA nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive, \"indicating an eye infection,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also reported only eye inflammation and recovered.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Health officials in Victoria reported that the case was detected in a child who acquired the infection in India and returned to Australia in March 2024. The officials also ruled out the possibility of further spread in the community. \"The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery,\" said Dr Clare Looker, Chief Health Officer, Victoria in a statement.\n\n\"There is no evidence of transmission in Victoria and the chance of additional human cases is very low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people,\" Dr Looker added. The report comes amidst a global outbreak of H5N1, including India, that has killed millions of wild birds and thousands of mammals. In 2023, the H5N1 virus killed a record number of birds and also spread to otters, sea lions, foxes, dolphins, and seals, among others. More recently, it affected numerous cattle farms across the US, and fragments of the virus were found in pasteurised milk sold in stores. Bird Flu Death Caught on Camera in Netherlands: Falcon Suffers Painful Death at Nest Allegedly Due to H5N1 Infection, Chicks Die Too; Disturbing Video Surfaces\n\nA Texas man, in contact with dairy cows, has reportedly acquired the virus. While the H5N1 virus has so far not caused any human-to-human transmission, the spread of the virus to dairy cattle has raised \"enormous concern\", the World Health Organisation said recently.

A nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive, \"indicating an eye infection,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.\n\nThe risk to the public remains low, but farmworkers exposed to infected animals are at higher risk, health officials said. They said those workers should be offered protective equipment, especially for their eyes.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also reported only eye inflammation and recovered.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan.\n\nHealth officials in Michigan have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored. U.S. officials said they had tested 40 people since the first cow cases were discovered in late March.\n\nThe CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah praised Michigan officials for actively monitoring farmworkers. He said health officials there have been sending daily text messages to workers exposed to infected cows asking about possible symptoms, and that the effort helped officials catch this infection. He said no other workers had reported symptoms.\n\nThe USDA is expanding financial incentives to dairy farmers whose herds have not yet been infected with the virus, Eric Deeble, a federal agriculture official, said Wednesday.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades?\n\nThey gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday. By Thursday of that same week, Hanson's colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm.\n\nThis time, it was not a drill.\n\n\"Mike had called me and said, 'Hey, I think I found it,'\" said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases.\n\nThat was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time.\n\nOver the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute -- or TEPHI -- took a different approach.\n\nRather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples. By doing this, they're able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don't know to look for.\n\n\"We can capture every known virus that that's in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that's the benefit, I think, of what we're doing relative to other sites,\" said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system.\n\nAt least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater.\n\nThe WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus.\n\nIn addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels.\n\nH5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu. Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter.\n\nTEPHI's system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention. Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater.\n\nUnlike taking a swab of a person's -- or a cow's - -- bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn't depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers. Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.\n\nThe biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen.\n\nSince March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor. They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results.\n\n\"We don't really know where it's coming from,\" said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI.\n\n\"We can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\" he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows.\n\nBut H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven't seen it in any of their samples until now.\n\n\"Certainly, something that's different now,\" Tisza said, \"is that it's commonly infecting dairy cows.\"\n\nOnly one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak. That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion. He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said.\n\nThe CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it's keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\nThe FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known.\n\nTEPHI's Maresso says they can't rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that's been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections. He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections.\n\n\"It would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we're sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\" Maresso said - even big cities in the state that aren't near dairy farms.\n\nAs far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it's getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it's hard to say. At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter.\n\n\"But overall, it's been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\" he said.\n\n\"As far as the overall trajectory, it's really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\" said Tisza, who notes that they're keeping an eye on it. \"And I'm sure you'll hear from us again if there's a big spike.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive, \"indicating an eye infection,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.\n\nThe risk to the public remains low, but farmworkers exposed to infected animals are at higher risk, health officials said. They said those workers should be offered protective equipment, especially for their eyes.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also reported only eye inflammation and recovered.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan.\n\nHealth officials in Michigan have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored. U.S. officials said they had tested 40 people since the first cow cases were discovered in late March.\n\nThe CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah praised Michigan officials for actively monitoring farmworkers. He said health officials there have been sending daily text messages to workers exposed to infected cows asking about possible symptoms, and that the effort helped officials catch this infection. He said no other workers had reported symptoms.\n\nUSDA is expanding financial incentives to dairy farmers whose herds have not yet been infected with the virus, Eric Deeble. a federal agriculture official, said Wednesday.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus.

This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new.\"\n\nH7N7 was the most common strain of bird flu in Australia, Dr Cooke said.\n\nOne of the strains in the last bird flu outbreak in Australia in 2020, which affected one-in-three egg farms in Victoria, was a H7 strain and testing is underway to determine if it's the same one.\n\n\"Agriculture Victoria is responding with staff on the ground supporting the business with further laboratory investigations as necessary,\" Dr Cooke said.\n\nThe property has been placed into quarantine with a 5km radius set up and affected animals will be \"depopulated\".\n\nSamples of the virus have been sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong for testing.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.\n\n\"Australia is the only continent now that has not found a H5N1,\" Dr Cooke said.\n\nWild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or contaminated environments.\n\nChickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, emus and ostriches are most susceptible to being affected by avian influenza.\n\nAll bird species are thought to be susceptible to the deadly H5N1, which has also been detected in more than 50 mammal species, including humans.\n\nInfected people have observed mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic, but some experience severe illness.\n\nAuthorities have reassured the public that eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.\n\nBird owners have been reminded to keep enclosures clean, quarantine new birds before integrating them with existing flocks, ensure footwear is clean and to always wash hands before and after handling birds or eggs.\n\nThe risk to Australia has increased following outbreaks of the H5N1 strain worldwide and the annual migration of wild birds remains a risk for native species.\n\nThere have been nine outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu in Australian farms between 1976 and 2021.\n\nThe most recent was in 2020 and 2021, where three strains of bird flu were detected at six Victorian poultry farms.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza",

without connections to outbreaks on farms.\n\nThe development could be significant because it suggests the virus is edging closer to humans.\n\nSouth Dakota's state veterinarian, Beth Thompson, said there was no livestock on the property where the pets died, but said it is not yet known how to cats became infected.\n\nTwo other cases of bird flu in barn cats on commercial diary farms, where cows were also infected with H5N1, recently occurred in Michigan - one in Isabella County and another in Ionia County, where two Virginia opossums were also infected.\n\nIt is the first time there have been cases in pets without connections to cows infected to H5N1\n\nThe above map shows the states that have reported bird flu infections in dairy herds\n\nOnly one person so far - a farmer in Texas - has tested positive for H5N1 virus this outbreak, but the CDC fears many more could be infected and not coming forward.\n\nIt comes as the FDA's top official revealed the agency is gearing up for a bird flu pandemic in people that could kill one in four of those it infects.\n\nThe two cats without connections to poultry or dairy cows are from South Dakota's Campbell County, which is in the northern part of the state on the border with North Dakota.\n\nThe news came from a notification from US government officials to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH).\n\nThe update did not mention what symptoms the cats had, but common signs of bird flu in cats include loss of appetite, severe depression, fever, difficulty breathing and jaundice.\n\nGOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY?\n\nEMAIL: Health@dailymail.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious reports of H5N1 in cats, in both America and abroad, have listed respiratory and neurologic symptoms in infected animals, which were frequently fatal.\n\nEarlier this month, roughly 70 Americans in Colorado were being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure.\n\nUp until this week, all the cats who died of bird flu had been living on farms and likely drank raw milk, which can harbor viruses because it has not been pasteurized - a process where milk is heated and then quickly cooled to kill microbes.\n\nBut the source of the two domestic cats in South Dakota is unknown, which suggests it could be spreading among them.\n\n'Cats are particularly susceptible to H5N1 2.3.4.4b viruses and the majority of sick cats have been reported at or near affected poultry facilities or dairies,' Shilo Weir, a spokesperson for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told BNO News.\n\nAt least 14 cats have died from bird flu since the virus was found in dairy cows in late March, though the actual count is thought to be much higher because of limited testing.\n\nThe spread of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b across the world, as well as the spread to a growing number of mammals, has increased anxieties about the possibility of transmission between humans from a future variant.\n\nAt this point, only a few human cases have been found after contact with infected birds or cattle.\n\nPeople who have close and lengthy contact with infected animals may become infected when the virus enters through their eyes or mouth, or when droplets are breathed in through the nose.\n\nAs the virus spreads, particularly between two different species, it acquires more mutations which may allow it to infect people more easily.\n\nSo far, there have been a total of 51 outbreaks at dairy farms in nine states.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In the United States, more than 9 million milk cows live on farms, where people muck their manure, help birth their calves, tend their sick, and milk them daily. That kind of proximity is exactly what gives a virus countless opportunities to encounter humans -- and then evolve from an animals-only virus into one that troubles people too.\n\nBut as unnerving as H5N1's current spread in cows might be, \"I would be a whole lot more concerned if this was an event in pigs,\" Richard Webby, the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told me. Like cows, pigs share plenty of spaces with us. They also have a nasty track record with flu: Swine airways are evolutionary playgrounds where bird-loving flu viruses can convert -- and have converted -- into ones that prefer to infect us. A flu virus that jumped from swine to humans, for instance, catalyzed the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. If there's a list of riskiest animals for an avian flu to infiltrate, \"pigs are clearly at the top,\" Webby said.\n\nTo successfully spread in a new species, a flu virus must infiltrate that creature's cells, reproduce inside of them, and then make it to the next host. This H5N1 has managed that feat in several animals, but so far, \"we're actually still dealing with a very avian virus,\" Michelle Wille, a virologist at the University of Melbourne, told me. For the virus to spread widely in humans, scientists think that it would need to pick up several new traits; so far, they've detected only one such modification, which has boosted the virus's ability to replicate inside mammalian cells.\n\nIn particular, the virus does not seem to have acquired what Webby considers the most crucial modification, one that would help it more efficiently enter human-airway cells in the first place. To do that, H5N1 would need to adjust its ability to latch on to particular sugars on cell surfaces, which effectively serve as locks to the cell's interior. For decades, though, the virus has preferred the version of those sugars that's most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of birds, and still seems to. Experts would really start to worry, Webby said, if it started glomming very tightly instead onto the ones most commonly found in human airways.\n\nThat said, the difference between those sugars is architecturally quite small. And although scientists might colloquially call some bird receptors and others human receptors, mammals can produce bird receptors, and vice versa. (Humans, for instance, have bird receptors in their eyes, which likely explains why the farm worker who appears to have caught H5N1 from a dairy cow developed only conjunctivitis.) The right animal host could encourage the virus to switch its preference from birds to humans -- and pigs fit that bill. They just so happen to harbor both bird receptors and human receptors in their respiratory tract, giving the flu viruses that infect them plenty of opportunity to transform.\n\nJust by hanging out in pigs for a while, H5N1 could enhance its ability to enter our cells. Or, perhaps even more concerning, it could encounter a flu that had already evolved to infect humans, and swaps bits of its genome with that virus. Pigs catch our viruses all the time. And should one of those pathogens hybridize with this H5N1, becoming human-adapted enough to spread among people but still avian-adapted enough to elude our immune system, a large-scale outbreak could begin. In the late 1970s, after an H1N1 avian-flu virus hopped from wild waterfowl into Europe's pig population, it took just a few years to start infecting people in Europe and Asia. Eventually, that same virus helped birth 2009's pandemic swine flu.\n\nRight now flu surveillance among swine needs to be dialed up, experts told me; protections for farm workers who handle the animals should ramp up too. Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University, told me that she'd also like to see cow's milk on farms better contained and more quickly heat-treated, so that other animals in the vicinity won't be exposed to the liquid in its raw form. (Several farm cats, for instance, appear to have caught H5N1 by drinking raw milk on farms.)\n\nAt this point, any worry about the virus evolving dramatically in pigs is still theoretical. H5N1 hasn't yet been detected in farm pigs, and experimental infections have found that the virus, although capable of infecting and replicating in swine, doesn't seem to transmit easily among them. Even if that were to change, pigs may not end up being the ideal venue for the many other genetic gymnastics that would help this virus adapt to us.\n\nThat said, \"we don't fully understand all of the mutations or genetic requirements\" needed to convert an avian virus, Louise Moncla, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. Viruses sometimes surprise us: 2009's H1N1 flu, for instance, caused a pandemic without making the genetic change that seems to have helped this new H5N1 along. Which means it's not a complete comfort that H5N1 isn't spreading in pigs yet -- especially when so many cows are getting sick now.\n\nRead: America's infectious-disease barometer is off\n\nScientists know relatively little about flu in cows. Although cattle have been known to catch certain kinds of flu before, the current outbreak is the first time a type-A influenza, the group that H5N1 belongs to, has been detected in their kind. Researchers are only now starting to understand the animals' susceptibility to these pathogens, and a recent preprint study, which Webby contributed to, revealed human-esque flu receptors in several parts of the cow body, some of which have bird receptors too -- a finding that suggests that the risk posed by continued spread in cows is higher than once thought. Webby, for one, isn't panicking yet, and he told me that the results mainly help explain why cow udders, now confirmed to be full of bird receptors, have turned out to be such great homes for H5N1. And because cows are likely spreading the virus to one another via milking equipment -- basically a free ride for the pathogen -- there may be little pressure for the virus to change its MO.\n\nThe bigger risk is simpler. \"The things that make me the most nervous are the species that we regularly interact with all the time,\" Moncla told me. The more cows catch the virus, the more exposure there will be for us, giving the virus more chances to explore and potentially adapt to our respiratory tract. Commercial milking is a messy affair: The processing machinery sprays and mists the liquid all about. Lakdawala imagines that milking an infected cow without protective equipment could be \"like me squirting 10,000 or 100,000 viral particles into someone's nose.\" Just one of those particles needs to carry the right set of genetic changes for this flu to become a human one.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_j_wu@theatlantic.com", "name": "Katherine J.

But now, bird flu has infected dairy cows in many states in the US.\n\nALSO READ: Stoves That Turn on By Themselves Recalled\n\nThis particular bird flu we're talking about is H5N1. The CDC has recorded that the \"wild bird-adapted HPAI H5N1 viruses were first identified in Europe during the fall of 2020\". From there it spread into Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nIt didn't hit the US until January 2022 when the CDC recorded the first infection in wild birds. Then, in February 2022, the first commercial outbreak happened in a flock of turkeys.\n\nFirst felt the hit of bird flu on our bank accounts due to the increase in the cost of eggs, chicken, turkey, etc. The costs seem to have come back down a bit. However, we may feel that pain again but with dairy products this time.\n\nThere are multiple reports of dairy cows across the US getting infected with this bird flu. How in the world did it go from birds to cows?\n\nThe CDC wrote in an article talking about the bird flu in cows:\n\n\"Mammals can be infected with H5N1 bird flu viruses when they eat infected birds, poultry, or other animals and/or if they are exposed to environments contaminated with virus.\"\n\nAs of writing this article, nine states have at least one herd of dairy cows infected with bird flu. Those states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas.\n\nSo there are no herds infected in Minnesota... yet, anyway. But, this absolutely still affects us here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nDairy cows now being infected with bird flu is a concern for dairy farmers and also dairy consumers. And I'm no scientist, but I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually spreads to Minnesota herds.\n\nAnother way that this affects us is if you buy dairy products from other states. Lancaster Farming says the top-producing dairy states in 2023 were California, Wisconsin, Idaho, Texas, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Washington.\n\nIdaho, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico all have herds with infected cattle.\n\nMy suggestion is to take a peek at where your dairy comes from before buying it.

The virus was detected in samples of unpasteurised milk from older, sick lactating cows.\n\nIn an interview with American broadcaster Public Broadcasting Service on May 16, evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey from the University of Arizona said he believed the jump of the virus from birds to cows happened between mid-November 2023 and mid-January 2024.\n\nThis was corroborated by a new research paper, funded by the USDA, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe USDA believes that wild birds, which can carry the virus, passed it to cattle in Texas. The outbreak then expanded as cows were shipped to other states.\n\n\"Data supports a single introduction event from wild bird origin virus into cattle, likely followed by limited local circulation for approximately four months prior to confirmation by USDA,\" the paper said.\n\nThe USDA said there were confirmed cases of bird flu in dairy cattle in nine American states, and the latest development was that a Texas dairy farmworker caught bird flu from a cow.\n\nUS scientists confirmed that it is the first time that a human has contracted the virus not from a bird, but a cow, and this finding was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in early May.\n\nThe US health and food safety authorities said the case did not change the risk for the public, which remained low.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has been evaluating milk from affected animals, said on April 23 that it had found bird flu viral particles in some samples of pasteurised milk, but that the commercial milk supply remains safe.\n\nPasteurisation is the process by which foods, such as milk and fruit juice, are treated with heat to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life.\n\nProfessor William Chen, director of the Food Science and Technology Programme, and the Future Ready Food Safety Hub at the Nanyang Technological University, told ST that the pasteurisation process currently applied on dairy products worldwide is effective in inactivating or killing pathogens, including the bird flu virus.\n\n\"Heating in the pasteurisation process changes the shape or structure of the external envelope of H5N1, (and this) affects the ability of H5N1 to infect, even though the virus genetic materials could still be detected,\" he noted.\n\n\"It is important to know that the detection of virus genetic materials in the dairy products does not mean that the virus is still infectious,\" he said, adding that as a precaution, it is still prudent to consume pasteurised dairy products.\n\nProf Chen also noted that the food safety procedures and guidelines of the FDA are \"very robust and trusted worldwide\".\n\nBut he added that what may need to be established is how H5N1 genetic materials came to be detected in cow milk.\n\n\"Enhanced safety measures may be introduced based on the ongoing investigation to identify the source of H5N1 contamination and/or its mechanism of transmission to cows, other animals, and even human beings,\" he said.\n\n\"Sending the pathogen for high-security testing (in Britain) could be part of further investigation to understand the source of H5N1 contamination.\"\n\nAccording to the US International Trade Administration, America was the third-largest exporter of dairy products to Singapore in 2022, after New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThere was a 12 per cent increase in imports of US dairy products from US$105 million (S$141.3 million) in 2021 to US$118 million in 2022.\n\nThe SFA spokeswoman said food safety is a joint responsibility.\n\n\"While SFA puts in place and enforces the regulatory measures, food importers must also maintain high food safety standards by complying with (our) requirements,\" she said.\n\nConsumers can play their part by adhering to good food safety practices, such as eating and drinking dairy products made from milk that has undergone heat treatment, she added.\n\nWhen asked if Singaporeans should switch to consuming dairy products from other countries just to be safe, Prof Chen said the heating during pasteurisation is usually effective in eliminating all germs in raw milk.\n\n\"With this understanding of food safety, consumers should make their (own) choices of sources,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.network", "dataType":

While we remain free from this virus for now, it's only a matter of time before it arrives.\n\nPenguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1.\n\nIndeed, avian influenza is knocking on our door right now. Just today, a case of avian influenza was reported in a return traveller, and Victorian authorities have confirmed avian influenza on an egg farm. Importantly, authorities have confirmed the virus affecting chickens is not the virus we are most worried about.\n\nResearchers and biosecurity authorities are on high alert, monitoring poultry farms and testing wildlife. They could do with our help. Anyone who comes across dead or dying birds - or mammals - should report them to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline.\n\nThe rise of an animal pandemic\n\nAvian influenza is a viral disease that infects birds, but can infect other animals.\n\nThere isn't just one strain of avian influenza found in wild birds - there's a diversity of subtypes and strains. Most cause no disease at all, and are naturally found in wild birds, including in Australia.\n\nBut others are deadly. The HPAI H5N1 clade was first detected in a goose in China, back in 1996. HPAI viruses cause high levels of sickness and death in both wild birds and poultry. It spreads rapidly and kills many of the birds - and animals - it infects.\n\nHPAI H5N1 has been endemic in poultry in Asia for decades, driving virus evolution and the emergence of a diversity of different virus clades (a clade is similar to a variant).\n\nIn 2005 we saw the first mass mortality event in wild birds. The virus spread to Europe and Africa through both poultry trade and potentially wild birds.\n\nIn 2014 the virus again entered Europe with wild birds, with spread to North America the same year, and in 2016, to Africa.\n\nBut the real change came in 2020. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds dramatically increased. In 2021, reports streamed in of mass mortality events in Europe and the virus rapidly travelled the world. The world was in the grip of a \"panzootic\" - a global pandemic in animals.\n\nThis particularly lethal clade of the virus jumped the Atlantic and reached North America around October 2021. A few months later, it again jumped to North America, but this time across the Pacific. In around October 2022, the virus entered South America, where it travelled an astonishing 6,000 kilometres to the southern tip of the continent in approximately six months.\n\nThe first cases were detected on the sub-Antarctic islands in October 2023 in brown skuas, scavenging birds. It's since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns. By February this year, the virus was detected on the Antarctica Peninsula).\n\nGlobally, millions of wild birds are likely to have been affected. In South America alone, about 650,000 wild birds were reported dead. Many more are never reported.\n\nThis virus is threatening the survival of entire species. For example, 40% of all Peruvian pelicans in Peru have died. Scientists spent years trying to bring back Californian condors from extinction, only to watch them succumb in 2023.\n\nIt will take years to fully comprehend the impact this panzootic has had around the world. Some populations of birds and even entire species may never recover.\n\nScientists are especially concerned about Antarctic wildlife.\n\nMost Antarctic species are found nowhere else on Earth. Many live in large colonies, which makes it easier for the virus to spread.\n\nQuestions remain over whether the virus will persist in Antarctica over winter and how it will spread in spring or summer.\n\nFrom birds to mammals\n\nMore than 50 species of predatory and scavenging mammals have now been recorded dying from avian influenza, most likely after eating dead birds.\n\nParticularly concerning are the deaths of 30,000 South American sea lions, 18,000 southern elephant seal pups in Argentina and dairy cows on at least 51 farms across the US.\n\nA recent study from Uruguay shows sea lions were dying before mass bird deaths, suggesting mammal-to-mammal spread may be driving outbreaks in coastal South America.\n\nSince the virus appeared in dairy cows in America, it has spread to herds across ten US states. We are still learning about how the virus affects cows, but infected cows produce less milk because of infection in their udders. A recent study suggests this is because udders have receptors similar to those found in birds.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration states pasteurisation is effective against this virus.\n\nGlobally, only 13 human cases have been confirmed due to this particular variant of HPAI H5N1, but noting that over 800 cases have been recorded since 2005. So far, one dairy worker is known to have caught the virus from cows.\n\nThe World Health Organization considers the risk of human infection to be low although the risk is higher (low to medium) for poultry farmers and other animal-exposed workers. There is no sign of human-to-human transmission.\n\nAustralia, the lucky country\n\nTo date, Australia and New Zealand have avoided HPAI H5N1. Australia has a nationally coordinated surveillance system for wild birds. This includes long-distance migratory birds such as shorebirds and seabirds.\n\nMillions of migratory birds arrive from northern Asia each year in spring. That means August to November will be our highest risk period.\n\nIn response, in both 2022 and 2023 we collected almost 1,000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Routine testing of dead birds by others around Australia has also come back negative.\n\nWe know migratory birds have arrived carrying other strains of avian influenza into Australia. It is only a matter of time before this HPAI H5N1 arrives.\n\nDucks have played a crucial role in moving the virus from place to place in the Northern Hemisphere. Studies in Asia and North America have shown some duck species are able to migrate while infected, as not all ducks die from the infection. One reason we think that Australia may have been spared so far because no ducks migrate here from Asia.\n\nWhen the virus does arrive, it will likely threaten entire species. Black swans are highly susceptible. Overseas, pelicans, cormorants, penguins, gannets, terns, gulls and seals have been amongst the hardest hit.\n\nThis spring, please look out for sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals and report it. Surveillance could help us manage the virus.\n\nRead more: The next pandemic?

Samples from the farms were positive in tests at Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and samples have been sent to the NVSL for further confirmation.\n\nAccording to the MDARD's line list, Michigan has now reported 18 outbreaks in dairy cows in nine counties, the most of any state.\n\nIn a May 16 update, the USDA reported 51 dairy herd outbreaks in nine states, which included 2 newly affected herds, one in Michigan and one in Idaho.\n\nA few H5N1 detections in cats were reported earlier in the US dairy farm outbreaks, and some of the animals were known to have consumed raw milk from infected cows. However, officials have now reported two infections in domestic cats without links to poultry or dairy cow outbreak farms. The two cats are from South Dakota's Campbell County, which is in the northern part of the state on the border with North Dakota.\n\nSouth Dakota has one outbreak in dairy cattle, which occurred in Brown County, which is also on the North Dakota border.\n\nThe WOAH report didn't say if the domestic cats in South Dakota showed clinical symptoms. Earlier reports on H5N1 in cats, both in the United States and abroad, described respiratory and neurologic symptoms in infected animals, which were often fatal.\n\nSince the Eurasian H5N1 strain was first detected in the United States in early 2022, the virus has been detected several times in mammals, mostly wildlife including bobcats and mountain lions -- species known to feed on infected wild birds.\n\nThe FDA today in an update outlined its next scientific studies to validate the impact of pasteurization on H5N1, which will include tests using the same pasteurization equipment that milk processors use. The agency noted that follow-up inoculation tests on 297 retail milk samples that had fragments of virus on PCR resting were all negative for live virus.\n\nTesting is under way on pooled raw milk slated for shipment for commercial processing, with the goal of characterizing virus levels before pasteurization. The FDA said the study will better replicate real-world conditions and more clearly gauge how effective pasteurization is at inactivating H5N1 in milk and other dairy products.\n\nAlso, the FDA announced an additional $8 million to bolster ongoing work to ensure the safety of the milk supply, which will support the studies to validate pasteurization criteria, conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, boost lab capacity, and train staff on biosecurity procedures.\n\nThe funding will help partnership activities with states and may allow the FDA to partner with universities to answer key research questions.\n\nMeanwhile, in its latest update on its response to the H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, the CDC said it is developing a plan for enhanced surveillance over the summer, which will include increasing the number of flu specimens tested and subtyped at public health laboratories.\n\n\"While influenza testing typically declines over the summer, this approach would maintain an increased level of testing,\" it said.\n\nThe CDC also said it has started the process of conducting a pandemic risk assessment of the H5N1 virus linked to the outbreak in dairy cattle using IRAT. CDC scientists measure 10 risk elements, which can take months to complete.\n\nThe CDC's last IRAT assessment was posted in July 2023 and involved the H5N1 virus that triggered an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm. Though that virus scored higher on some of the CDC's risk measures, the overall threat is moderate and similar to the earlier version of the virus.\n\nRegarding wastewater monitoring for influenza A, the CDC said it compares the most recent weekly levels with those reported from the same site the previous season. Sites in the \"high\" category prompt CDC outreach to local jurisdictions and intensive surveillance review.\n\nIn the most recent week, there were four locations in the high category: two in California (San Francisco/San Mateo and Sonoma), and one each in Kansas (Saline County) and Texas (Dallas) The CDC said so far there are no unusual flu indicators in people, including for H5N1.",

Officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low.\n\nThe first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also was treated with an antiviral drug and reported eye inflammation.\n\nSince 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species - including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises - in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about the safety of the milk and meat and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades?\n\nThey gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday. By Thursday of that same week, Hanson's colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm.\n\nThis time, it was not a drill.\n\n\"Mike had called me and said, 'Hey, I think I found it,'\" said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases.\n\nThat was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time.\n\nA different kind of wastewater monitoring\n\nOver the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute -- or TEPHI -- took a different approach.\n\nRather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples. By doing this, they're able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don't know to look for.\n\n\"We can capture every known virus that that's in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that's the benefit, I think, of what we're doing relative to other sites,\" said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system.\n\nAt least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater.\n\nThe WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus.\n\nIn addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels.\n\nH5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu. Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter.\n\nTEPHI's system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention. Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater.\n\nData at the flush of a toilet\n\nUnlike taking a swab of a person's -- or a cow's - -- bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn't depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers. Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.\n\nThe biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen.\n\nSince March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor. They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results.\n\nTheir findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts.\n\nSource of the signal is still a mystery\n\n\"We don't really know where it's coming from,\" said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI.\n\n\"We can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\" he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows.\n\nBut H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven't seen it in any of their samples until now.\n\n\"Certainly, something that's different now,\" Tisza said, \"is that it's commonly infecting dairy cows.\"\n\nOnly one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak. That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion. He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said.\n\nThe CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it's keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\nThe FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known.\n\nTEPHI's Maresso says they can't rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that's been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections. He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections.\n\n\"It would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we're sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\" Maresso said - even big cities in the state that aren't near dairy farms.\n\nAs far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it's getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it's hard to say. At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter.\n\n\"But overall, it's been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\" he said.\n\n\"As far as the overall trajectory, it's really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\" said Tisza, who notes that they're keeping an eye on it. \"And I'm sure you'll hear from us again if there's a big spike.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality rate among humans infected with influenza A(H5N1) is approximately 50%.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is carefully surveilling H5N1 outbreaks and exposures among humans, partnering with the US Department of Interior, the US Department of Agriculture, and state and local health departments. This surveillance spans public health laboratories, emergency departments, clinical laboratory trends, and wastewater sources.\n\nThe US government also has two vaccine candidates in the nation's stockpile in limited quantities. In the event of outbreaks among humans, hundreds of thousands of doses of these vaccines could be shipped out within a few weeks, and over 100 million doses within three to four months.\n\nKurdach continues: \"These precautionary measures being taken by the US government are essential in order to prepare for and mitigate the effects of a potential pandemic, which is a possibility if viral mutations allow H5N1 to be readily transmitted between humans.\"\n\nAccording to the WHO, the next pandemic is most likely to be caused by the influenza virus.\n\nGlobalData has identified 13 vaccines in active clinical development (Phases I-III) indicated for pandemic influenza/influenza A(H5N1). Of note are vaccine candidates from GSK (influenza A/H5N1 vaccine) and Moderna (mRNA-1018) - both of which are mRNA vaccines in active Phase I/II clinical trials. An mRNA H5N1 vaccine would be particularly beneficial in the event of a pandemic, as they can be manufactured much quicker than traditional vaccines.\n\nKurdach concludes: \"Although the current risk of infection with influenza A(H5N1) to the general public is low, it is important to avoid contact with domestic and wild birds, and to cook poultry products well.\"", "source": {"uri": "globaldata.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Market Research Reports & Consulting | GlobalData UK Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-to-human_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human-to-human transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moderna"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.globaldata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GD-logo-vector_RGB-02-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

While we remain free from this virus for now, it's only a matter of time before it arrives.\n\nPenguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1.\n\nIndeed, avian influenza is knocking on our door right now. Just today, a case of avian influenza was reported in a return traveller, and Victorian authorities have confirmed avian influenza on an egg farm. Importantly, authorities have confirmed the virus affecting chickens is not the virus we are most worried about. Authorities are responding and we expect more information to come in the days ahead.\n\nResearchers and biosecurity authorities are on high alert, monitoring poultry farms and testing wildlife. They could do with our help. Anyone who comes across dead or dying birds - or mammals - should report them to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline.\n\nThe rise of an animal pandemic\n\nAvian influenza is a viral disease that infects birds, but can infect other animals.\n\nThere isn't just one strain of avian influenza found in wild birds - there's a diversity of subtypes and strains. Most cause no disease at all, and are naturally found in wild birds, including in Australia.\n\nBut others are deadly. The HPAI H5N1 clade was first detected in a goose in China, back in 1996. HPAI viruses cause high levels of sickness and death in both wild birds and poultry. It spreads rapidly and kills many of the birds - and animals - it infects.\n\nHPAI H5N1 has been endemic in poultry in Asia for decades, driving virus evolution and the emergence of a diversity of different virus clades (a clade is similar to a variant).\n\nIn 2005 we saw the first mass mortality event in wild birds. The virus spread to Europe and Africa through both poultry trade and potentially wild birds.\n\nIn 2014 the virus again entered Europe with wild birds, with spread to North America the same year, and in 2016, to Africa.\n\nBut the real change came in 2020. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds dramatically increased. In 2021, reports streamed in of mass mortality events in Europe and the virus rapidly travelled the world. The world was in the grip of a \"panzootic\" - a global pandemic in animals.\n\nThis particularly lethal clade of the virus jumped the Atlantic and reached North America around October 2021. A few months later, it again jumped to North America, but this time across the Pacific. In around October 2022, the virus entered South America, where it travelled an astonishing 6,000 kilometres to the southern tip of the continent in approximately six months.\n\nThe first cases were detected on the sub-Antarctic islands in October 2023 in brown skuas, scavenging birds. It's since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns. By February this year, the virus was detected on the Antarctica Peninsula).\n\nGlobally, millions of wild birds are likely to have been affected. In South America alone, about 650,000 wild birds were reported dead. Many more are never reported.\n\nThis virus is threatening the survival of entire species. For example, 40% of all Peruvian pelicans in Peru have died. Scientists spent years trying to bring back Californian condors from extinction, only to watch them succumb in 2023.\n\nIt will take years to fully comprehend the impact this panzootic has had around the world. Some populations of birds and even entire species may never recover.\n\nScientists are especially concerned about Antarctic wildlife.\n\nMost Antarctic species are found nowhere else on Earth. Many live in large colonies, which makes it easier for the virus to spread.\n\nQuestions remain over whether the virus will persist in Antarctica over winter and how it will spread in spring or summer.\n\nFrom birds to mammals\n\nMore than 50 species of predatory and scavenging mammals have now been recorded dying from avian influenza, most likely after eating dead birds.\n\nParticularly concerning are the deaths of 30,000 South American sea lions, 18,000 southern elephant seal pups in Argentina and dairy cows on at least 51 farms across the US.\n\nA recent study from Uruguay shows sea lions were dying before mass bird deaths, suggesting mammal-to-mammal spread may be driving outbreaks in coastal South America.\n\nSince the virus appeared in dairy cows in America, it has spread to herds across ten US states. We are still learning about how the virus affects cows, but infected cows produce less milk because of infection in their udders. A recent study suggests this is because udders have receptors similar to those found in birds.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration states pasteurisation is effective against this virus.\n\nGlobally, only 13 human cases have been confirmed due to this particular variant of HPAI H5N1, but noting that over 800 cases have been recorded since 2005. So far, one dairy worker is known to have caught the virus from cows.\n\nThe World Health Organization considers the risk of human infection to be low although the risk is higher (low to medium) for poultry farmers and other animal-exposed workers. There is no sign of human-to-human transmission.\n\nAustralia, the lucky country\n\nTo date, Australia and New Zealand have avoided HPAI H5N1. Australia has a nationally coordinated surveillance system for wild birds. This includes long-distance migratory birds such as shorebirds and seabirds.\n\nMillions of migratory birds arrive from northern Asia each year in spring. That means August to November will be our highest risk period.\n\nIn response, in both 2022 and 2023 we collected almost 1,000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Routine testing of dead birds by others around Australia has also come back negative.\n\nWe know migratory birds have arrived carrying other strains of avian influenza into Australia. It is only a matter of time before this HPAI H5N1 arrives.\n\nDucks have played a crucial role in moving the virus from place to place in the Northern Hemisphere. Studies in Asia and North America have shown some duck species are able to migrate while infected, as not all ducks die from the infection. One reason we think that Australia may have been spared so far because no ducks migrate here from Asia.\n\nWhen the virus does arrive, it will likely threaten entire species. Black swans are highly susceptible. Overseas, pelicans, cormorants, penguins, gannets, terns, gulls and seals have been amongst the hardest hit.\n\nThis spring, please look out for sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals and report it. Surveillance could help us manage the virus.\n\nRead more: The next pandemic?

And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades?\n\nThey gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday. By Thursday of that same week, Hanson's colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm.\n\nThis time, it was not a drill.\n\n\"Mike had called me and said, 'Hey, I think I found it,'\" said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases.\n\nThat was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time.\n\nA different kind of wastewater monitoring\n\nOver the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute -- or TEPHI -- took a different approach.\n\nRather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples. By doing this, they're able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don't know to look for.\n\n\"We can capture every known virus that that's in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that's the benefit, I think, of what we're doing relative to other sites,\" said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system.\n\nAt least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater.\n\nThe WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus.\n\nIn addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels.\n\nH5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu. Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter.\n\nTEPHI's system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention. Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater.\n\nData at the flush of a toilet\n\nUnlike taking a swab of a person's -- or a cow's - -- bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn't depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers. Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.\n\nThe biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen.\n\nSince March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor. They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results.\n\nTheir findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts.\n\nSource of the signal is still a mystery\n\n\"We don't really know where it's coming from,\" said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI.\n\n\"We can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\" he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows.\n\nBut H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven't seen it in any of their samples until now.\n\n\"Certainly, something that's different now,\" Tisza said, \"is that it's commonly infecting dairy cows.\"\n\nOnly one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak. That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion. He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it's keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\nThe FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known.\n\nTEPHI's Maresso says they can't rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that's been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections. He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections.\n\n\"It would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we're sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\" Maresso said - even big cities in the state that aren't near dairy farms.\n\nAs far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it's getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it's hard to say. At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter.\n\n\"But overall, it's been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\" he said.\n\n\"As far as the overall trajectory, it's really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\" said Tisza, who notes that they're keeping an eye on it. \"And I'm sure you'll hear from us again if there's a big spike.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

While we remain free from this virus for now, it's only a matter of time before it arrives.\n\nPenguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1.\n\nIndeed, avian influenza is knocking on our door right now. Just today, a case of avian influenza was reported in a return traveller, and Victorian authorities have confirmed avian influenza on an egg farm. Importantly, authorities have confirmed the virus affecting chickens is not the virus we are most worried about.\n\nResearchers and biosecurity authorities are on high alert, monitoring poultry farms and testing wildlife. They could do with our help. Anyone who comes across dead or dying birds - or mammals - should report them to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline.\n\nAvian influenza is a viral disease that infects birds, but can infect other animals.\n\nThere isn't just one strain of avian influenza found in wild birds - there's a diversity of subtypes and strains. Most cause no disease at all, and are naturally found in wild birds, including in Australia.\n\nBut others are deadly. The HPAI H5N1 clade was first detected in a goose in China, back in 1996. HPAI viruses cause high levels of sickness and death in both wild birds and poultry. It spreads rapidly and kills many of the birds - and animals - it infects.\n\nHPAI H5N1 has been endemic in poultry in Asia for decades, driving virus evolution and the emergence of a diversity of different virus clades (a clade is similar to a variant).\n\nIn 2005 we saw the first mass mortality event in wild birds. The virus spread to Europe and Africa through both poultry trade and potentially wild birds.\n\nIn 2014 the virus again entered Europe with wild birds, with spread to North America the same year, and in 2016, to Africa.\n\nBut the real change came in 2020. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds dramatically increased. In 2021, reports streamed in of mass mortality events in Europe and the virus rapidly travelled the world. The world was in the grip of a \"panzootic\" - a global pandemic in animals.\n\nThis particularly lethal clade of the virus jumped the Atlantic and reached North America around October 2021. A few months later, it again jumped to North America, but this time across the Pacific. In around October 2022, the virus entered South America, where it travelled an astonishing 6,000 kilometres to the southern tip of the continent in approximately six months.\n\nThe first cases were detected on the sub-Antarctic islands in October 2023 in brown skuas, scavenging birds. It's since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns. By February this year, the virus was detected on the Antarctica Peninsula).\n\nGlobally, millions of wild birds are likely to have been affected. In South America alone, about 650,000 wild birds were reported dead. Many more are never reported.\n\nThis virus is threatening the survival of entire species. For example, 40% of all Peruvian pelicans in Peru have died. Scientists spent years trying to bring back Californian condors from extinction, only to watch them succumb in 2023.\n\nIt will take years to fully comprehend the impact this panzootic has had around the world. Some populations of birds and even entire species may never recover.\n\nScientists are especially concerned about Antarctic wildlife.\n\nMost Antarctic species are found nowhere else on Earth. Many live in large colonies, which makes it easier for the virus to spread.\n\nQuestions remain over whether the virus will persist in Antarctica over winter and how it will spread in spring or summer.\n\nMore than 50 species of predatory and scavenging mammals have now been recorded dying from avian influenza, most likely after eating dead birds.\n\nParticularly concerning are the deaths of 30,000 South American sea lions, 18,000 southern elephant seal pups in Argentina and dairy cows on at least 51 farms across the US.\n\nA recent study from Uruguay shows sea lions were dying before mass bird deaths, suggesting mammal-to-mammal spread may be driving outbreaks in coastal South America.\n\nSince the virus appeared in dairy cows in America, it has spread to herds across ten US states. We are still learning about how the virus affects cows, but infected cows produce less milk because of infection in their udders. A recent study suggests this is because udders have receptors similar to those found in birds.\n\nThe World Health Organization considers the risk of human infection to be low although the risk is higher (low to medium) for poultry farmers and other animal-exposed workers. There is no sign of human-to-human transmission.\n\nTo date, Australia and New Zealand have avoided HPAI H5N1. Australia has a nationally coordinated surveillance system for wild birds. This includes long-distance migratory birds such as shorebirds and seabirds.\n\nMillions of migratory birds arrive from northern Asia each year in spring. That means August to November will be our highest risk period.\n\nIn response, in both 2022 and 2023 we collected almost 1,000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Routine testing of dead birds by others around Australia has also come back negative.\n\nWe know migratory birds have arrived carrying other strains of avian influenza into Australia. It is only a matter of time before this HPAI H5N1 arrives.\n\nDucks have played a crucial role in moving the virus from place to place in the Northern Hemisphere. Studies in Asia and North America have shown some duck species are able to migrate while infected, as not all ducks die from the infection. One reason we think that Australia may have been spared so far because no ducks migrate here from Asia.\n\nWhen the virus does arrive, it will likely threaten entire species. Black swans are highly susceptible. Overseas, pelicans, cormorants, penguins, gannets, terns, gulls and seals have been amongst the hardest hit.\n\nThis spring, please look out for sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals and report it. Surveillance could help us manage the virus.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe next pandemic?

While we remain free from this strain for now, it's only a matter of time before it arrives.\n\nPenguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1.\n\nIndeed, avian influenza is knocking on our door right now. Just today, a case of avian influenza was reported in a return traveler, and Victorian authorities have confirmed avian influenza on an egg farm. Importantly, authorities have confirmed the virus affecting chickens is not the virus we are most worried about. Authorities are responding and we expect more information to come in the days ahead.\n\nResearchers and biosecurity authorities are on high alert, monitoring poultry farms and testing wildlife. They could do with our help. Anyone who comes across dead or dying birds -- or mammals -- should report them to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline.\n\nAvian influenza is a viral disease that infects birds, but can infect other animals.\n\nThere isn't just one strain of avian influenza found in wild birds -- there's a diversity of subtypes and strains. Most cause no disease at all, and are naturally found in wild birds, including in Australia.\n\nBut others are deadly. The HPAI H5N1 clade was first detected in a goose in China, back in 1996. HPAI viruses cause high levels of sickness and death in both wild birds and poultry. It spreads rapidly and kills many of the birds -- and animals -- it infects.\n\nHPAI H5N1 has been endemic in poultry in Asia for decades, driving virus evolution and the emergence of a diversity of different virus clades (a clade is similar to a variant).\n\nIn 2005 we saw the first mass mortality event in wild birds. The virus spread to Europe and Africa through both poultry trade and potentially wild birds.\n\nIn 2014 the virus again entered Europe with wild birds, with spread to North America the same year, and in 2016, to Africa.\n\nBut the real change came in 2020. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds dramatically increased. In 2021, reports streamed in of mass mortality events in Europe and the virus rapidly traveled the world. The world was in the grip of a \"panzootic\" -- a global pandemic in animals.\n\nThis particularly lethal clade of the virus jumped the Atlantic and reached North America around October 2021. A few months later, it again jumped to North America, but this time across the Pacific. In around October 2022, the virus entered South America, where it traveled an astonishing 6,000 kilometers to the southern tip of the continent in approximately six months.\n\nThe first cases were detected on the sub-Antarctic islands in October 2023 in brown skuas, scavenging birds. It's since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns. By February this year, the virus was detected on the Antarctica Peninsula).\n\nGlobally, millions of wild birds are likely to have been affected. In South America alone, about 650,000 wild birds were reported dead. Many more are never reported.\n\nThis virus is threatening the survival of entire species. For example, 40% of all Peruvian pelicans in Peru have died.

We are now taking measures necessary to stamp it out to remove any onward spread.\"\n\nThe outbreak presented no risk to human health, he said.\n\nOnly a small part of the industry has been affected, said Rowan McMonnies, chief executive of industry body Australian Eggs, adding that farmers would be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves\".\n\nChicken producer Inghams Group (ING.AX), plunged as much as 16% but pared losses to 5.5% by 0701 GMT after it said operations had not been affected.\n\nThe Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies had stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution but added, \"No discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level.\"\n\nIn 2020, Victoria was the site of an H7N7 outbreak, the most recent of Australia's nine outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) since 1976.

Sign up here.\n\nBird flu doesn't \"transmit easily from person-to-person,\" according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses \"pandemic potential,\" each human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases -- none in the U.S. -- where human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be \"probable,\" including in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.\n\nIt is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.\n\nRaw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there's a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.\n\nThe CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals \"confirmed or suspected\" of having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is \"extremely low\" due to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. \"It doesn't matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza... runny eggs and rare pieces of meat\" are never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To \"play it safe,\" consumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure \"the yolks are firm with no runny parts,\" Daisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said.\n\nSymptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can't be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients.\n\nThis year's egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods -- the country's largest egg producer -- temporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu.\n\nOnce chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network.\n\nThe FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn't be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. Sequirs, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023.\n\nAs of May 14, more than 90 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 46 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a \"huge concern,\" urging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation \"because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.\" The increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 \"could indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,\" Andrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it's spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year. Besides cattle, bird flu has been detected in over 200 other mammals -- like seals, raccoons and bears -- in the U.S. since 2022. Although rare, even domestic pets like dogs and cats are susceptible to the virus, and the FDA warns against giving unpasteurized milk to cats to avoid possible transmission.\n\nWHO Warns Threat Of

Authorities in Victoria stated that the child experienced a severe infection but has since made a full recovery.\n\nNotably, contact tracing efforts have not identified any further cases associated with this incident, and health officials have emphasized the low risk of the virus spreading quickly between people.\n\nDr. Claire Looker, the state's chief health officer, asserted that this was the first human case of bird flu in Australia and added that the strain detected in the child is not the same as those responsible for outbreaks in the United States earlier this year.\n\nConcurrently, a separate outbreak of a different strain of highly pathogenic bird flu, an as-yet-unidentified H7 variant, has been detected at an egg farm near Melbourne. Authorities have imposed movement restrictions around the affected farm, and the birds will be destroyed to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nGraeme Cooke, Victoria's chief veterinary officer, noted that the area has a high density of poultry businesses, both egg-laying and meat production. While the current outbreak presents no risk to human health, the authorities have taken measures to prevent further spread to other properties.\n\nThe poultry industry in Australia has expressed concerns, and Rowan McMonnies, the chief executive of the Australian Eggs, stated that farmers will be \"working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves.\" However, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) has reassured that companies have stepped up biosafety measures, and no significant impact on chicken meat supplies is expected at the retail level.\n\nIn 2020, the state of Victoria experienced an outbreak of the H7N7 strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which the government has described as the most recent of the nine such outbreaks that have occurred in Australia since 1976. Authorities were able to quickly bring all of these previous HPAI outbreaks under control and eradicate the virus.\n\nA recent study in the U.S. found that one in five milk samples tested showed traces of bird flu.\n\nDemand for raw milk has surged in recent months despite experts warning that it presents a high risk for infection with bird flu.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Bird Flu", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "baila_eve_zisman@uinterview.com", "name": "Baila Eve Zisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact tracing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal husbandry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Department-for-Environment-Food-and-Rural-Affairs-workers-clear-up-dead-turkey-carcasses-at-Redgrave-Park-Farm-where-around-2600-birds-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

of poultry deaths at an egg farm near Meredith, about 40km northwest of Geelong.\n\n\"Preliminary tests have confirmed the presence of the avian influenza virus,\" chief veterinary officer Graeme Cooke said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Agriculture Victoria is responding with staff on the ground supporting the business with further laboratory investigations as necessary.\"\n\nThe property has been placed into quarantine with samples of the virus sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong to determine the strain of the disease.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.\n\nA deadly strain, the highly pathogenic H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, has been spreading globally, causing widespread outbreaks in bird populations and extensive deaths.\n\nIt has not yet been detected in Australia, the Department of Agriculture said.\n\nWild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or contaminated environments.\n\nChickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, emus and ostriches are most susceptible to being affected by avian influenza.\n\nAll bird species are thought to be susceptible to the deadly H5N1, which has also been detected in more than 50 mammal species, including humans.\n\nInfected people have observed mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic but some have experienced severe illness.\n\nAuthorities have reassured the public that eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.\n\nPeople cannot become infected by consuming cooked chicken meat or eggs, Agriculture Victoria said.\n\nBird owners have been reminded to keep enclosures clean, quarantine new bids before integrating them with existing flocks, ensure footwear is clean and to always wash hands before and after handling birds or eggs.\n\nDr Cooke urged poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners to report unexplained bird deaths to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline or their local vet.\n\nThe risk to Australia has increased following outbreaks of the H5N1 strain worldwide and the annual migration of wild birds remains a risk for Australian species.\n\nThere have been nine outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu in Australian farms between 1976 and 2021.\n\nThe most recent was in 2020 and 2021, where three strains of bird flu were detected at six Victorian poultry farms.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

A man in Texas who worked on a dairy farm was infected there earlier in this outbreak. The country's first case, in the spring of 2022, was in a man in Colorado who was involved in culling H5N1-infected birds in a poultry outbreak there.\n\nTo date, nearly 900 people in 24 countries have been confirmed to have been infected with H5N1 since 2003, with most cases tied to exposure to infected poultry. On rare occasions, there have been small clusters of cases that raised questions about whether limited person-to-person spread has occurred -- something that is hard to prove when multiple people have the same exposures to infected animals. Ongoing spread among people has not been detected, and it is believed the virus would need to evolve further to gain the ability to spread easily to and among people.\n\nThe outbreak in cattle, the first known to have occurred with this virus, was confirmed in late March, though evidence suggests that it had been underway for several months before testing revealed the cause of a drop in milk production among cows.\n\nSince then the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed outbreaks in 51 herds in nine states, including Michigan, which has reported 19 infected herds -- more than any other state. (The USDA's most recent tally does not include four that Michigan reported since May 17.) Experts following the outbreak believe the national count of affected herds significantly underestimates the scope of the problem. Both the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have admitted that farmers have been reluctant to allow testing of their cows or their workers, afraid of the stigma attached to being associated with the outbreak.\n\nBut that has been less true in Michigan, where state officials have taken a uniquely aggressive stance in its public health response, informed, in part, by the devastating impacts H5N1 has had on the state's poultry flocks in the past few years.\n\nOn May 1, Tim Boring, director of the state's Department of Agriculture, declared an \"extraordinary animal health emergency,\" signing an order requiring Michigan farmers to step up their biosecurity measures. \"Most farms have been good cooperators with that,\" Boring told STAT in an interview last week.\n\nHe said \"well over several dozen individuals,\" including some who had been experiencing flu-like symptoms, have been tested for H5N1. This case is the first to have come back positive.\n\nFarmers have also been open to working with local health authorities to fill out questionnaires that could help investigators track how the virus is moving between dairy herds throughout the state. \"Hundreds and hundreds of farm workers here in Michigan have been interviewed,\" Boring said. \"They understand the importance of understanding how this is moving around so we can limit the spread of this.\"", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_branswell@statnews.com", "name": "Helen Branswell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_molteni@statnews.com", "name": "Megan Molteni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/53612950870_1c46c0d9c7_o-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1624, "textEnd": 1630}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 2245, "textEnd": 2250}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The egg farm where the outbreak occurred has been put into quarantine after a number of poultry died, the agriculture ministry of the state of Victoria said.\n\nFirst laboratory tests show the virus is an as yet unidentified H7 strain that likely came from the wild bird population and has been seen in Australia before, Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke said. He said restrictions on movement had been imposed in the area around the farm and the birds would be destroyed.\n\n\"This area does have a high density of poultry businesses, both egg laying and poultry meat,\" he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio. \"At this stage we can't say whether there'll be any onward spread to other properties.

Store-bought milk could be another way to track the bird flu outbreak in cows", "body": "Scientists from the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center have managed to generate a full genetic sequence of H5N1 virus from milk, a development they suggest means commercially purchased milk products could be used to monitor the progress of the bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle and to check for important changes in the virus over time.\n\nWith dairy farmers still reluctant to allow testing of their cattle, scientists trying to assess whether the outbreak is increasing or waning are in the dark. Likewise, their surveillance for important changes in the viruses -- changes that would signal the virus is evolving to be better able to infect mammals -- has been hampered by the limited data being shared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAnalyzing store-bought milk could provide a work-around, the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson researchers suggested, similar to the efforts underway to analyze wastewater from around the country to check for presence of influenza A viruses. (H5N1 is a member of that large family of flu viruses.)\n\n\"I think the big thing is we've shown that this can be done, and it's a good tool,\" said Pavitra Roychoudhury, a research assistant professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. \"And so if there's resistance to having cows tested, this might be the next best option. And I think we can track for variant changes over time with this method.\"\n\nSince the outbreak of H5N1 in cows was first confirmed on March 25, a total of 51 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus. One human infection has been detected, in a dairy farm worker in Texas who developed conjunctivitis.\n\nPublic health authorities and scientists believe H5N1 is more widely disseminated than those numbers would suggest, but are stymied in efforts to map the scale of the problem due to a lack of cooperation from dairy farmers.\n\nFarmers have been reluctant to allow their cattle to be tested, seeing no upside and plenty of downside in being identified as having cows infected with the bird flu virus.\n\nA U.S. Department of Agriculture regulation that went into effect on April 29 requires farmers to test lactating dairy cows due to be shipped across state lines. But the rule limits the number of cows that must be tested per shipment to 30, leaving the choice of the cows to be tested to the individual farmer. Only 15 new herds have been reported since the rule went into effect, leaving observers to wonder whether it can have its intended effect, as currently written.\n\n\"Whenever you have a regulation, someone will find a way around it,\" said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a professor of large animal internal medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nPoulsen, who believes testing of milk in the bulk tanks on individual farms will eventually need to take place, agrees that monitoring milk for virus particles would provide useful data.\n\nSo does Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, located at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Webby's laboratory was involved in early testing to see if evidence of H5N1 RNA could be found in commercially purchased milk.\n\nA large survey, conducted in mid-April by the Food and Drug Administration, found that one in five milk samples brought in 38 states was positive for H5N1 virus. It should be noted that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was used can detect both live viruses and fragments of dead ones, and cannot differentiate between the two. Efforts to grow live, infectious virus from positive milk samples have failed so far, buttressing the FDA's claim that pasteurization kills H5N1 virus in milk.\n\nWebby said there are some potential complications involved in using milk to monitor changes in H5N1; as the virus changes, it could be difficult to know at times what is being seen. For instance, if genetic sequencing showed evidence of more than one version of the virus in a sample, it might be hard to know whether changes observed in, say, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase proteins -- the H and N in an influenza A virus' name -- occurred in all the viruses, or if some had one of the changes, some had the other, and some had both.\n\nThat's not to suggest the work wouldn't still provide important data, Webby said. \"The fact that viruses with those two mutations are out there in itself is useful information. So I don't want to pooh-pooh the whole idea at all. I think it's absolutely a great way to follow the continued evolution of the virus. It's just not going to be as tidy as doing single source samples.\"\n\nPeter Han, research manager of a laboratory run by Lea Starita at the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine at the University of Washington, said the group collected 40 samples of milk simply by asking people to bring in a test tube's worth from the supply in their own fridges. Two of the 40 were positive for H5N1 fragments and the full genetic sequence was generated from one of those two samples. The two positive samples were from milk that was packaged in Colorado, which has reported outbreaks in herds.\n\nThough inexpensive, the work wasn't easy, Roychoudhury said. \"Milk's a really challenging sample to work with, because there's a lot of fat,\" she said. \"So the fact that we were able to get a whole genome out of it was slightly surprising to us. It also means there was enough virus in there to pull a genome out, which to me was slightly -- maybe not slightly -- alarming.\"\n\nThe genetic sequence of the virus was uploaded to Genbank, a sequence database run by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Roychoudhury said the group struggled to figure out how to date the finding -- genetic sequences are typically identified by where and when the virus sample was taken, and the species or substance from which the viral information was retrieved. With no clear idea when the milk was produced, the group identified the sequence simply by month and year.\n\nThe sequence has also been posted on Nextstrain.org, a website designed to track the evolution of pathogens like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.\n\nTrevor Bedford, a computational biologist in the vaccine and infectious disease division at Fred Hutchinson and one of the architects of Nextstrain, said the group behind the generation of the genetic sequence from milk has notified the various U.S. government agencies involved in the H5N1 response in the hopes that an organized effort to use this form of surveillance can be put in place.\n\n\"You could either imagine some systematic effort from something like USDA -- I'm not sure who's the exact right agency -- or the academic groups could collaborate a bit more,\" Bedford said, adding he thinks monitoring milk could provide key information that's been missing up till now. \"Separate from the sequencing for evolution [of the virus], which I think is very important, just even understanding prevalence through space and time, I think, would be really helpful and important.\"", "source": {"uri":

The earlier patient from a Texas farm also had a mild illness, which consisted of conjunctivitis.\n\nNatasha Bagdasarian, MD, MPH, chief medical executive at the MDHHS, said, \"Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan. Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available.\"\n\nAlso in a statement today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a nasal swab for the worker tested negative for H5 influenza at the state lab in Michigan, but an eye swab shipped to the CDC for testing was positive, suggesting an eye infection, similar to the Texas patient.\n\nThe CDC's lab is one of a few where can eye specimens can be used with the CDC's H5 test. The CDC also retested the nasal specimen, which was negative for the virus. Further subtyping is underway pending genetic sequencing.\n\nSequencing of the virus from the clinical specimen is underway and will be made available within 1 to 2 days if successful. Additional genetic analysis will look for any changes to the virus that could alter the agency's risk assessment. For now, the CDC said the identification of a second case doesn't change its assessment that the risk to humans remains low.\n\nMichigan's agriculture department today reported another H5N1 avian flu outbreak in a dairy herd, bringing the number of affected farms in the state to 19.\n\nIn a statement, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) said the newly detected outbreak in in Gratiot County. Samples tested positive for H5N1 at the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and will be sent to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory for further confirmation.\n\nThe latest outbreak struck a facility in Gratiot County, where the virus was found at three other dairy farms earlier this week.

The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans.\n\nThat hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nFifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored.\n\nThe virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus.\n\nThe new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Michigan state health authorities also confirmed they had detected a case of bird flu in a dairy worker exposed to an infected cattle herd.\n\nBird flu has been spreading widely in US cattle herds, having been detected in nine states during the current outbreak. The two new human cases bring the total of human bird flu infections detected so far this year to eight worldwide but they add to worries among health officials on alert over another virus spilling over into human populations, just a year after the official end of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFurther signs of bird flu transmission proved a boon for vaccine-focused biotechs involved in the Covid-19 jab rollout whose share prices have fallen from pandemic highs as investors have soured on them because of waning demand. Investors are betting the companies will once again be at the forefront of battling the next pandemic, if it materialises.\n\nClare Looker, Victoria's chief health officer, said the case there involved an H5N1 strain unrelated to the outbreaks in the US. A separate H7 bird flu strain was also detected at an egg farm near Melbourne, early laboratory tests indicated. Australia had previously been the only continent whose animals had been unaffected by the bird flu outbreak.\n\nLooker said contact tracing efforts had not uncovered any further cases and stressed that the risk of further transmission was low as there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday the Michigan case did not change the agency's assessment that the human health risk was low but it \"underscores the importance\" of people with regular exposure to infected animals taking necessary precautions. The CDC has upped surveillance testing among farm workers.\n\nShares in Germany-based CureVac, which announced an early-stage H5N1 vaccine trial in collaboration with GSK last month, rose 18.8 per cent to $3.91.\n\nModerna's stock rose 13.7 per cent to $163.33, after gaining about 50 per cent in the past month. Moderna is conducting a mid-stage trial using its mRNA vaccine technology to target the H5 family of flu viruses, of which the H5N1 strain is a part.\n\nGermany-based BioNTech closed up 11 per cent at $102.30. Novavax, which has been conducting pre-clinical tests on vaccines targeting three different H5N1 strains, rose 5.3 per cent to $15.70.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Novavax told the Financial Times that its vaccine platform \"could be an attractive asset from a pandemic preparedness perspective because the currently available avian influenza vaccines produce limited immune response\".\n\nThe pandemic provided a huge windfall to vaccine makers such as Moderna and BioNTech, whose first approved product was their Covid vaccine, but investors have since soured on the group as the pandemic has receded and demand for shots has waned.\n\nUS health authorities have a vaccine stockpile of several hundred thousand doses which were effective against bird flu, according to officials. US officials have also previously said that existing partnerships with three vaccine makers -- GSK, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi -- would allow production to be increased to millions of doses if a pandemic were to occur.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type":

However, only 36% said that they would offer such a vaccine to public health personnel monitoring or investigating H5N1-exposed people.\n\nOf the human exposures to H5N1 since January 2022, 88% occurred from backyard poultry flocks, 82% from commercial poultry, 54% from wild birds including rescued birds, and 18% from mammals, including farm animals, domestic pets, or wild animals.\n\nThe CDC and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists conducted the online survey from January 10 to March 6, 2024 -- before the outbreaks of H5N1 in dairy cattle occurred in multiple states and one dairy farm worker in Texas developed conjunctivitis from working with H5N1-infected cattle.\n\nThe current outbreak of bird flu has been spreading worldwide since 2020, and the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus was first identified in wild birds in North America in 2021, the authors noted. In the U.S., wild birds infected with H5N1 were found in 49 states as of February 2022, and in terrestrial and marine mammals in 27 states.

Pasteurized milk and cooked beef are safe to consume, the FDA has said.\n\nDairy workers remain at highest risk and are urged to wear protective equipment and wash their hands regularly, the letter said. The worker who contracted H5N1 and their close contacts were prescribed an oral antiviral. The day after he was tested, the worker reported no symptoms other than discomfort in the eyes, probably due to swelling.\n\nH5N1 has long been spreading in birds, although in a number of forms with varied potential to infect other species. The virus found in the worker had a mutation that has been associated with infections in mammals and detected previously in humans, the researchers said.\n\nStill, the pathogen in both the man and the cattle primarily maintained its avian genetic characteristics and didn't show changes that would make it easier to latch onto people or transmit to humans, the researchers found. There was no suggestion the virus had any resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat it.\n\nH5N1 has pandemic potential, the CDC noted, and there are two potential vaccine candidates that show potential to prevent it. Only 26 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans have been reported by the World Health Organization from 2020 to this February.\n\nTags Dairy Workers Bird Flu H5n1 U.s.

Most noticeably, their milk production declines.\"\n\nWoolstenhulme said there have been concerns from the public the disease could be passed through dairy, but she said no live virus has been found in pasteurized dairy products.\n\n\"Pasteurized dairy products are safe for humans,\" said Woolstenhulme.\n\nShe also said there shouldn't be concerns about people contracting the disease through beef, and just recommended people cook their meat to the recommended temperatures.\n\nAmanda Price, Utah's assistant state veterinarian, wrote in an article that HPAI is the name given to influenza viruses that can cause high death loss in domestic poultry and other birds.\n\nPrice said the virus found in the affected cattle is the same strain that has been circulating in wild birds and domestic poultry in North America since 2022.\n\n\"There is a lot we don't know about this disease,\" wrote Price, \"including how the cows contracted the disease and how or if it is being spread between cattle.\"\n\nShe asked dairy producers to be patient while state and federal agencies try to find the answers.\n\nWoolstenhulme said it is still unclear if the disease is being spread only by wild birds or if it is being passed from one infected cow to another.\n\nAccording to CDC, spread of HPAI viruses from mammal to mammal is thought to be rare, but possible.\n\nTo protect their animals from the virus, Woolstenhulme said dairy producers can take precautions like keeping water sources and feed away from areas they could be accessed by wild birds.\n\nFor Utah, the federal mandate requiring dairy cows to be tested before crossing state lines hasn't had a huge impact, according to Woolstenhulme, because Utah doesn't import many dairy cows.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType":

Both instances were reported in the state of Victoria.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Agriculture Victoria agency, preliminary tests have confirmed the presence of avian influenza at an egg farm near Meredith, Victoria. Samples were delivered to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness at Geelong for further tests, which will determine the serotype, as well as whether it is a highly pathogenic or low pathogenic strain. However, a notice on the Australian Chicken Meat Federation website stated, \"it does not appear to be the virulent strain, clade 2.3.4.4b that has affected large populations of avian and other species internationally.\"\n\nThe affected farm has been placed under quarantine, and animal health officials are at the site to \"support the business and investigate further.\"\n\nAll poultry and bird owners across Victoria have been advised to practice strong biosecurity measures.\n\nThe Victoria Department of Health reported that a Victorian child apparently contracted the H5N1 virus during a visit to India in March. The child was ill at the time, but according to a health advisory from Victoria Chief Health Officer Dr. Clare Looker, \"is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery.\"\n\nThe avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system. Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this human case.\n\nLooker stated, \"There is no evidence of transmission in Victoria and the chance of additional human cases is very low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people.\"\n\nThe Victoria Department of Health stated that it was supporting Agriculture Victoria in responding to the avian influenza case at the egg farm. Testing did confirm that the human case was not related to the farm outbreak.\n\nWhile HPAI has had a persistent presence in Asia, Europe, North America, Africa and South America in recent years, and it has even recently reached the Antarctic region, this is the first time avian influenza has been reported in the Oceania region.\n\nWhile speaking during the Poultry Market Intelligence Forum during the International Production & Processing Expo (IPPE) in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 31, Dr. David Swayne, consultant, Birdflu Veterinarian LLC, discussed why the virus had not yet reached that part of the world.\n\nSwayne, formerly of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said that Oceania was a \"separate avian influenza ecozone.\"\n\nIn addition to Oceania and Asia being divided by water, the two geographical areas are also divided by an invisible faunal line known as the Wallace line.\n\n\"It's an ecological barrier that changes the migratory pattern of a lot of aquatic birds, and to this point, at least when studying avian influenza viruses, is a barrier. What happens in Asia, doesn't always go into Australia,\" said Swayne.", "source": {"uri": "wattagnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATTAgNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Shah laid out the agency's recommendations that influenza surveillance systems continue operating at enhanced levels during the summer and to increase the number of positive influenza A virus samples submitted for subtyping to help detect even rare cases of human H5N1 virus infection in the community.\n\nCDC Influenza Division Director Vivien Dugan joined leaders and members from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), Big Cities Health Coalition (BCHC), the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) on the call.\n\nShah emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant and outlined a nationwide influenza virus monitoring plan for the summer season, which is a time when influenza activity and testing typically decline. The goal of this plan is to maintain heightened awareness of circulating influenza viruses given the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 among poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.\n\nSpecifically, Shah asked jurisdictions to work with clinical laboratories to increase submissions of positive influenza virus samples to public health laboratories for subtyping. Subtyping is a process that determines whether the influenza A sample is a common, seasonal influenza virus or a novel virus like H5N1.\n\nCDC is committed to supporting state and local public health officials and will continue to provide information to support their H5N1 influenza response efforts.", "source": {"uri": "cdc.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_State_and_Territorial_Health_Officials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of State and Territorial Health Officials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Public_Health_Laboratories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Public Health Laboratories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_State_and_Territorial_Epidemiologists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_County_and_City_Health_Officials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Association of County and City Health Officials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.cdc.gov/media/images/releases/about-cdc-fb_pr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The virus has been detected on every continent (including penguins in Antarctica), continues to circulate among wild birds, and has been detected in more than 50 species of mammals. Cattle are just the latest in a series of zoonotic diseases that have cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nA 21-year-old man in Vietnam died from the virus in March. Dairy worker falls ill with mild illness.And just this week, a child traveling from India Diagnosed with H5N1 in Australia.\n\nHuman spillover has so far only led to isolated cases, with no confirmed human-to-human transmission. Of the 874 reported H5N1 infections in 23 countries since 2004, 458 have died, a case fatality rate of over 50%. This does not mean that a major pandemic would follow the same pattern if the avian virus were to start spreading from person to person, but it clearly reflects that now is the time to start taking serious preparations.\n\nThe first thing you need to do right is monitoring and testing. The organization I chair, FIND, works with partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), CEPI and the 100 Day Mission to ensure countries have access to quality diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. is.\n\nAnimal experiments are being conducted, but their ease and frequency have surprising limitations. Bird flu has been detected in so many cattle in the United States that the disease could have been circulating undetected for months. In the UK, despite the situation across the Atlantic, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it did not believe cattle were at risk.\n\nAfter all, the more testing we do, the better we will understand how quickly the virus is moving and mutating. Additionally, it is clearly important that testing is available everywhere so that if an outbreak is detected, people with symptoms and those who have been in close contact with infected people can be tested and isolated. At the beginning of a disease outbreak, this is the most effective way to break the chain of infection and prevent an epidemic from developing into a pandemic.\n\nOur recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic does not mean that an avian flu outbreak will follow the same path. Coronaviruses have hit the elderly and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes and heart disease hardest. An H5N1 outbreak may follow a completely different trajectory, given mutations between species and the nature of viruses. influenza virus\n\nDoing testing properly, ensuring there are multiple types of effective tests that work in different resource settings, and ensuring there is diversity in manufacturers providing tests is critical in preparing for and responding to an outbreak.\n\nStrong surveillance and accurate testing capabilities, especially for populations likely to come into contact with the virus, such as farm workers and people who live in close contact with animals, are essential to establishing the genetic sequence of the virus; Essential for establishing gene sequences. the development of treatments and other countermeasures, including vaccines; The earlier we detect outbreaks of H5N1 or other pathogens with pandemic potential, the more likely we are to address them before they cross borders.\n\nEarlier this year, FIND partnered with the 100-day mission to identify pandemic Potentially approved tests, treatments, and vaccines are limited for everything but COVID-19 and Ebola. This is frankly illogical and poses a significant risk to our collective health security. We should not wait for an outbreak to occur before ramping up investment in countermeasures.\n\nThese gaps in the global blueprint for pandemic preparedness and response are exactly what government leaders will discuss as they negotiate a pandemic agreement in Geneva. There is limited time left to complete the international instrument by the end of May deadline, and if leaders fail to prevent a repeat of the inequities that have undermined the COVID-19 response, future prospects will be at risk. It will be a failure for generations. and This resulted in more than 14.9 million excess deaths in 2021. A study in the journal Nature states: Over 1 million people People died needlessly because they couldn't share the vaccine.\n\nAccurate and accessible diagnostic testing and surveillance are the first steps in an effective response that can stop the spread of infection.

State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials to discuss the H5N1 response efforts.\n\nWhile the infection has not posed the same threat to humans as it has to poultry and livestock at this time, Dr. Shah underscored the importance of state jurisdictions working alongside clinical laboratories to \"increase submissions of positive influenza virus samples to public health laboratories for subtyping,\" which would determine if the virus is seasonal like influenza A or B, or if it matches the H5N1 strain.\n\nThe CDC noted it plans to support state and local health departments in executing these extended H5N1-focused influenza monitoring and response efforts.", "source": {"uri": "beckershospitalreview.com", "dataType": "news",

(WOOD) -- The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development says three more dairy herds across the state have been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu.\n\nHerbruck's to lay off 400 employees, citing bird flu outbreak\n\nThe positive tests came in over the past week. The herds are in Clinton, Gratiot and Ionia counties.\n\nEighteen dairy herds have now contracted the virus since late March when the first infection was confirmed in Montcalm County. Those infections are now across nine Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Clinton, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm and Ottawa.\n\n\"What is happening with HPAI in Michigan mirrors what is happening in states across the country,\" MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring said in a press briefing. \"This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert. This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities.\"\n\nBird flu is spreading, but should you be worried?\n\nMultiple federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, say the commercial milk supply is safe because of pasteurization and federal animal health requirements.\n\n\"If animals are sick, they are not allowed to have that milk go into the bulk tank for sale. That milk is pulled,\" Michigan State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said. \"The animals are not quarantined. We ask the herds to restrict movements and only move animals if absolutely necessary to be moved.\"\n\nHPAI is a highly contagious virus that can spread from infected wild birds to other animals through an item exposed to the virus, like equipment, feed or even the clothes of the caretakers. In rare cases, humans can contract the virus.\n\nA farm worker in Texas tested positive for HPAI last month, the second human case ever on record in the United States.\n\nSign up for breaking news alert emails\n\nThe current HPAI outbreak, which sparked in February of 2022, has now affected more than 90 million birds nationwide, making it the worst outbreak of bird flu in American history. While HPAI is almost always fatal in birds, the mortality rate is considered low in cows.\n\nThose who suspect avian flu in their domestic animals are asked to call MDARD immediately at 800.292.3939 during the day or 517.373.0440 after hours.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

She is co-author of a March 2024 study on the H5N1 strain causing fatal disease and transmitting between co-housed ferrets.\n\nIn 2020, Belser studied how different strains of the H9N2 flu virus, which have genetic and antigenic differences, show varying patterns of replication and transmission in mammalian animal models. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was a collaborator.\n\nIn 2016, Belser studied how different bird flu strains, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, could infecthuman pulmonary endothelial cells.\n\nRichard Webby, Ph.D., a BARDA-associated researcher and director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, is co-author of a May 2024 paper studying the susceptibility and transmissibility in the pig population of highly pathogenic avian influenza derived from mink.\n\nIn a 2017 study funded by the NIAID, Webby tested bird flu vaccines on ferrets, infecting them with the wild virus to determine the vaccines' efficacy.\n\nHooker told The Defender this research is dangerous because ferrets \"are immunologically very close to humans. ... It's not a huge leap for them to suddenly get into the human population and start human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nChristine Oshansky, chief of Pandemic Vaccines and Adjuvants at BARDA, co-authored a 2021 study ofhighly pathogenic influenza H7N9 and a vaccine formulation.\n\nIn 2018, Oshansky tested H5N1 vaccines stored in the national Influenza vaccine stockpile for up to 12 years to determine if they could be effective against divergent A (H5) influenza viruses.\n\nThe WHO funded the May 2020 study, \"Pandemic potential of highly pathogenic avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5) viruses.\" Collaborators included the CDC, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and other organizations. Webby and Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, Ph.D.of the University of Wisconson are among the listed authors.\n\n\"That's the huge danger of doing this work,\" Hooker said. \"Whether it's an accidental or intentional release, you're playing with these pathogens so that they're basically creating variants that are infectious in humans.\"\n\nThe vaccine cash cow\n\nHooker told Iversen there are \"myriad patents associated with bird flu vaccines [and] bird flu pathogens.\"\n\nKawaoka, the researcher long funded by NIAID to conduct bird flu research, has 78 patents in his portfolio, many of them related to bird flu vaccination.\n\nIn 2023, Kawaoka filed patents on:\n\nIn 2022, Kawaoka filed a patent for influenza virus replication for vaccine development (US-113906-B2).\n\nRichard Bright, former BARDA director and a bird flu researcher at the CDC from 1998-2006, has an \"extensive patent portfolio on -- you guessed it -- bird flu vaccines,\" Hooker said. \"And so these prophets of doom hit the airwaves and they scare everybody.\"\n\nHooker also noted that Moderna is developing an mRNA-based bird flu vaccine.\n\nU.S. relaxed H5N1 bird flu regulations this month\n\nThe U.S. government on May 6 released a new policy to tighten oversight of federally funded research on potentially dangerous pathogens, which won't take effect until May 2025.\n\nThe policy categorizes high-risk research into two groups, requiring risk-benefit assessments and mitigation plans for both, with an additional layer of review for research involving pathogens with enhanced pandemic potential.\n\nThe move aims to address concerns about lax oversight and ambiguous guidelines while ensuring that critical research on pandemic preparedness and medical advancements can continue, according to Nature.\n\nIn a seemingly contradictory move, U.S. government officials on May 14 temporarily relaxed regulations on how public health laboratories and healthcare facilities handle, store and transport H5N1 bird flu samples, according to Reuters.\n\nThis 180-day change comes in response to the recent spread of the virus to dairy cattle in nine U.S. states.\n\nThe revised guidance, requested by the Association of Public Health Laboratories, aims to reduce bureaucratic burdens and allow lab staff to focus on testing, preparing for the possibility that the virus could acquire the ability to become easily transmitted among humans.", "source": {"uri": "infowars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InfoWars"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It would also increase the risk of the virus ' jumping' to humans, either through contact with agricultural workers or via food products like meat and dairy. In the US at least one farm worker has been infected and several species of mammals including farm cats, wild possums and foxes.\n\n\"The occurrence of events in America has led to us taking preparatory measures and a more watchful eye,\" said Prof Banyard.\n\n\"Samples have been shared with our very high containment secure labs, and we're having a look to understand if there is genuinely something different about this clade of virus.\"\n\nAPHA is also working to develop new diagnostic tests that can detect H5N1 in milk, which is where the highest viral load has been found in sick US cows. Existing tests in the UK are designed to identify the virus in respiratory samples like nasal and throat swabs.\n\n\"We're doing this so that if something did happen - and I don't think it will - then we could diagnose [H5N1] quickly,\" said Prof Banyard.\n\nDespite these measures, the government is still not testing British cattle for the highly pathogenic avian flu, which has killed millions of birds and animals since it started circulating in 2020, a decision which has been criticised by scientists as \"short-sighted\".\n\nThe Department for Food, Environment, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has insisted that there is \"no reason to suspect the virus is circulating in British cattle,\" yet scientists say that they are unlikely to find something they are not testing for.\n\nProf Banyard admitted much of the work undertaken by the government unit is \"reactive\".\n\n\"This reminds me a lot of how we handled Covid-19 from the beginning,\" said Dr Krutika Kuppalli, a spokesperson for the Infectious Disease Society of America and former WHO medical officer.\n\n\"When Covid was in China, it was hard for other governments to fathom it could reach their countries - but it did.\n\n\"If you wait until reports of sick cows you are going to be behind the ball,\" stressed Dr Kuppalli.\n\nDEFRA's involvement in particular has raised concerns among some experts because its principal role is to promote British farm produce.\n\nThe agency lobbied to stop the press calling the 2008 H1N1 pandemic Swine Flu because \"pigs are not to blame\" and it presided over the salmonella and BSE scandals of the 1990s, the latter of which killed 176 people.\n\n\"The financial implications for the agriculture industry are important and should be taken into account, but surveillance and early detection not only help to contain an outbreak but prevent less economic peril in the long-term,\" said Dr Kuppalli.\n\nProf Banyard said part of the reason the UK isn't yet testing for H5N1 in cows is that there have been no clinical signs of illness in the animals reported to authorities.\n\nCows who have become sick with H5N1 in the US have been found to produce around 10-20 per cent less milk than normal, which would be an indication that they have the virus.\n\nSince there has been \"no mysterious milk loss\" reported to DEFRA or APHA, the agencies don't deem it necessary to start testing, and as such they are \"pretty confident we don't have the virus in [UK] cattle,\" said Prof Banyard.\n\nScientists have pointed out that this argument is not foolproof, however.\n\n\"This virus has continued to surprise us - we are still learning and don't know if it's spreading in asymptomatic cows, thus the prudent approach would be to be proactive and test to confirm there are no cases,\" said Dr Kuppalli.\n\n\"We know the virus can spread from infected birds to cattle - it's a question of when not if and they should be testing cattle,\" added Prof Devi Sridhar, a global public health expert at the University of Edinburgh and former scientific adviser to the Scottish government on Covid-19.\n\nAlthough it is still unclear how the virus first jumped to cattle, US health authorities think the most likely route of infection is via H5N1-positive wild birds - thousands of which have been detected in the UK over the last three years.\n\nProf Banyard conceded that it was \"possible\" that infected birds could act as a route of transmission to cows in Britain.\n\n\"If you had a dead duck in a water trough that then leached virus, and cows drank it directly, then yes it's possible - but we've got no evidence of any cattle showing clinical signs of disease,\" he said.\n\n\"How can they be sure? The UK government can't say for certain that the cows don't have H5N1, because they could be asymptomatic,\" stressed Dr Kuppalli.\n\nSo far this year, there have been two confirmed cases of H5N1 in humans.\n\nIn Vietnam, a man died in March after direct contact with an infected bird, whilst in Texas a farm worker caught the virus from sick cattle - although his symptoms were mild.\n\nThe US Centre for Disease Control is monitoring a further 300 people who have been exposed to the virus via cattle for signs of infection.\n\nThe WHO considers the risk to humans low but urged countries to rapidly share information to enable real-time monitoring of the situation to ensure preparedness as the virus continues to spread.\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global

Shah laid out the agency's recommendations that influenza surveillance systems continue operating at enhanced levels during the summer and to increase the number of positive influenza A virus samples submitted for subtyping to help detect even rare cases of human H5N1 virus infection in the community.\n\nCDC Influenza Division Director Vivien Dugan joined leaders and members from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), Big Cities Health Coalition (BCHC), the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) on the call.\n\nShah emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant and outlined a nationwide influenza virus monitoring plan for the summer season, which is a time when influenza activity and testing typically decline. The goal of this plan is to maintain heightened awareness of circulating influenza viruses given the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 among poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.\n\nSpecifically, Shah asked jurisdictions to work with clinical laboratories to increase submissions of positive influenza virus samples to public health laboratories for subtyping. Subtyping is a process that determines whether the influenza A sample is a common, seasonal influenza virus or a novel virus like H5N1.\n\nCDC is committed to supporting state and local public health officials and will continue to provide information to support their H5N1 influenza response efforts.\n\n/CDC Release.

Study Finds That New H5N1 Strain: Subtype Clade 2.3.4.4b With The Mutation PB2 T271A Has Capacity For Airborne Transmissions! - Thailand Medical News", "body": "H5N1 News: In a significant development, researchers have discovered that a strain of the H5N1 influenza virus has acquired the ability for airborne transmission. This revelation, emerging from a study that is covered in this H5N1 News report, highlights the evolving threat of H5N1 viruses to mammals, including humans. This study marks the first instance of an H5N1 subtype clade 2.3.4.4b virus demonstrating such airborne transmissibility.\n\nAirborne transmission, weight loss and survival for ferrets infected with PB2 A271T A/mink (H5N1).\n\nFour donor ferrets were inoculated with A/mink (H5N1) PB2 A271T and 24\u2009h later each donor was paired with a single respiratory contact in a transmission cage. Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 14 days, and weight loss and clinical signs were monitored. A, C, and B, D display viral titers and weight loss from individual donor and respiratory contacts, respectively. DR and RC denote donor and respiratory contact, respectively. Each bar or line represents an individual animal. Males are DR1, DR2, RC1 and RC2 and females are DR3, DR4, RC3 and RC4. E denotes euthanasia. Ferret DR4 was euthanized on day 10 due to pronounced weight loss. Dotted line denotes limit of detection.\n\nThe research, led by scientists at Penn State University, focused on the PB2 T271A mutation found in a strain previously linked to an outbreak among farmed mink in Spain. The study's findings underscore the need for vigilant monitoring of these viruses, given their potential to spill over into humans.\n\nFirst Detection in Dairy Cattle\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the United States reported its first case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cattle in March. By May, the virus had spread across nine states. The exact mode of transmission among cattle remains uncertain, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing investigation. The Penn State study, however, provides crucial insights into the airborne transmission capabilities of a similar H5N1 strain, raising alarms about its pandemic potential.\n\nUnderstanding Airborne Transmission\n\nTo evaluate the airborne transmission potential of the H5N1 virus, the research team reconstructed the virus using genetic sequences available from public databases. They then conducted experiments using ferrets, which share similar respiratory tract characteristics with humans, making them an ideal model for studying influenza virus transmission.\n\nThe team assessed both direct and indirect transmission by placing infected ferrets in close proximity to uninfected ones. The results were alarming: 75% of ferrets exposed to the virus through direct contact became infected, while 37.5% of those exposed to airborne particles also contracted the virus. This demonstrated that even a small amount of the virus could cause infection, highlighting its low infectious do se.\n\nThe Role of Mutation PB2 T271A\n\nA critical aspect of this study was understanding the role of the PB2 T271A mutation in the virus's ability to transmit and cause disease. The researchers engineered a version of the virus without this mutation and observed a significant reduction in both mortality and airborne transmission among the ferrets.\n\n\"These findings suggest that the PB2 T271A mutation enhances viral replication, contributing to both virulence and transmission,\" said Dr Troy Sutton, the study's corresponding author. This discovery is pivotal as it allows for targeted surveillance of similar mutations in circulating H5N1 strains, providing an early warning system for potential outbreaks.\n\nImplications for Human Health\n\nWhile the study offers crucial insights, it also emphasizes that the ferrets used had no preexisting immunity to influenza, unlike the majority of humans who have been exposed to H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses. This prior exposure could offer some level of cross-protection against H5N1, potentially mitigating the impact of the virus on humans.\n\nHowever, Dr Sutton noted that the transmission rate observed in the mink strain is lower than that typically seen in pandemic influenza viruses. \"Pandemic influenza viruses usually transmit via the airborne route to 75% to 100% of contacts within three to five days, whereas the mink virus transmitted to fewer than 40% of contacts after nine days,\" he explained.\n\nThis lower transmission rate does not eliminate the risk but suggests that while the virus has pandemic potential, it does not yet possess the same attributes as known pandemic strains. The strain affecting cattle has not caused severe disease in cattle or humans so far. However, the longer the virus circulates and the more humans are exposed to it, the higher the chances of it evolving to become more infectious to humans.\n\nGlobal Perspective and Historical Context\n\nThe H5N1 viruses, originating from the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage, have long posed a pandemic threat. Since their emergence in Asia, nearly 900 human cases have been reported worldwide, with a staggering 50% mortality rate. The new H5N1 variant, belonging to subclade 2.3.4.4b, has rapidly spread across continents, causing ecological devastation and large die-offs among wild bird populations.\n\nIn late 2021, this subclade was first detected in North America and has since spread to South America, affecting both wild and domestic bird populations. The virus has spilled over into several mammalian species, including skunks, foxes, bears, and seals. Seven human infections with subclade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have been documented between January 2022 and March 2023.\n\nExperimental Insights and Broader Implications\n\nThe researchers' experimental approach, involving ferrets, revealed that the H5N1 virus could transmit efficiently through direct contact and less efficiently through airborne routes. Sequence analyses indicated that transmission was not linked to specific mutations, suggesting that the virus's ability to infect and spread among mammals could be due to other factors.\n\nIn dose de-escalation studies, the A/mink (H5N1) virus showed a low infectious dose and high virulence across various doses, causing severe disease in all infected animals. This virulence was observed even at minimal doses, underscoring the virus's potential danger.\n\nMoreover, the PB2 T271A mutation played a significant role in enhancing the virus's replication and transmission. When this mutation was reversed, the virus showed reduced polymerase activity, decreased mortality, and diminished airborne transmission. These findings highlight the critical impact of specific genetic mutations on the virus's behavior and potential to cause pandemics.\n\nFuture Directions and Surveillance\n\nGiven the findings, ongoing risk assessment and enhanced surveillance in wild and domestic animals are crucial. The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring viral evolution and the emergence of new mutations that could increase the virus's transmissibility and virulence.\n\nThe researchers also pointed out that ferrets used in the study lacked pre-existing immunity to influenza, which is not the case for most humans. Future studies should explore how prior exposure to seasonal influenza strains might affect disease severity and transmission of H5N1.\n\nIn conclusion, this groundbreaking study sheds light on the evolving threat of H5N1 influenza viruses, particularly the impact of the PB2 T271A mutation on airborne transmission. The findings underscore the urgent need for continuous surveillance and preparedness to mitigate the potential pandemic threat posed by these viruses as they continue to evolve and spread.\n\nThe study findings were published in the peer reviewed journal: Nature Communications.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48475-y\n\nFor the latest H5N1 News, keep on logging to Thailand Medical News.\n\nRead Also:\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-h5n1-genotype-affecting-cows-in-america-possibly-gains-entry-into-humans-via-the-eyes-thru-the-new-pb2-e67k-mutation\n\nCheck Out:\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/articles/h5n1-avian-flu", "source": {"uri": "thailandmedical.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Home -

The philanthropically funded effort will begin sharing data with local public health officials and on its public dashboard in the coming weeks, one of its leaders told STAT.\n\nWith widespread reluctance among the dairy industry to test cows or the farm workers who care for them, scientists and public health officials trying to assess whether the disease's spread is speeding up or slowing down are largely in the dark. Testing wastewater for a genetic signature of the H5N1 bird flu virus could give communities another way to spot potential outbreaks.\n\n\"This is a very new thing that we have avian influenza circulating among dairy cattle and there's a lot we're still learning,\" said Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist and epidemiologist at Emory and one of the directors of WastewaterSCAN. \"We've heard that more information would be useful, and that this is one extra piece of information that can help officials understand what may be happening with these outbreaks.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, the team at WastewaterSCAN developed a probe that detects H5 influenza viruses, including the H5N1 virus that has now been found in 52 dairy herds in nine states. The assay sat unused until this spring, when unusually high influenza A activity began lighting up their dashboard in the Texas panhandle -- the same region where the first cases of H5N1 in dairy cattle were confirmed on March 25.\n\nWolfe and her colleagues went back and applied the probe to samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants in the area, and found the spikes were mostly due to large amounts of viral fragments from H5-specific influenza.\n\nThe WastewaterSCAN team hypothesized that those viral fragments were the result of discharges from dairy processing plants in the area. But there's currently no good way to determine the exact source of viral contamination in a given sewershed -- in addition to human sewage, animal products can also end up there, either through agricultural and industrial dumping or by environmental runoff.\n\nTheir results, which were released as a preprint in April, were published Monday in Environmental Science & Technology Letters. So far, the scientific literature on wastewater detection of H5 influenza subtypes is scant but encouraging. In another recent preprint study, researchers at the University of Texas and Baylor University began finding H5N1 sequences in wastewater treated at 19 plants across nine Texas cities starting on March 4 of this year.\n\nWastewater epidemiology has been in use for decades to detect polio in countries where the disease remains endemic, and more recently, to estimate the prevalence of opioid use in U.S. communities. But the nation's wastewater monitoring capacity got a huge boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, gaining visibility and credibility as an effective pandemic management tool. In addition to academic research efforts like WastewaterSCAN, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operates the National Wastewater Surveillance System, which monitors 600 sites for SARS-CoV-2, mpox, and influenza A.\n\nEarlier this month, the CDC began releasing data from its influenza A-tracking efforts on a public dashboard. Since the agency is not doing H5-specific testing at this time, the dashboard shows only overall influenza A activity. But because the other influenza A viruses that cause human disease tend to circulate at very low levels during the summer months in the U.S., the presence of high levels of influenza A in the wastewater could be a reliable indicator that something unusual is going on -- at least until the return of higher levels of seasonal flu in the fall.\n\nIn its interactive map, the CDC serves up current levels of influenza A compared to historical data, providing needed context to determine whether what is being seen is abnormal. When levels are at the 80th percentile or higher, officials said the agency works with state and local partners to investigate further. For now, the CDC is only including data from wastewater treatment sites that were collecting samples during last year's flu season, starting October 1, 2023. There are currently 230 sites from 34 states that meet that criteria.\n\nTom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told STAT via email that the agency is in communication with WastewaterSCAN and other academic groups to better understand the potential value of more widespread testing for H5-specific subtypes.\n\n\"CDC is considering the possible role for other sites to test for the influenza A H5 virus subtype in wastewater with our public health partners,\" he wrote. \"Wastewater surveillance is an evolving science. We are continuing to review data and methodologies that may improve our public health surveillance.\"\n\nWolfe agreed that there is still a lot the field of wastewater epidemiology has to learn about how to interpret the kind of H5-specific data that WastewaterSCAN will soon be collecting. But it's that particular data that local public health authorities are hungry for right now, she said. \"If there are increases in influenza A -- because that's data a lot of people have access to -- is that actually being driven by an H5 virus or not? Being able to disambiguate that, and understand where these signals are coming from, is something we've been getting a lot of interest in.\"\n\nWastewater isn't the only workaround that researchers are using to try to track the spread of H5N1. Frustrated with the lack of testing and limited genetic data being shared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, some scientists have begun sequencing the bird flu virus from store-bought milk as a way to monitor its movement and look for any changes to its genome that could make it more adept at infecting humans.\n\nOn Wednesday, public health officials in Michigan confirmed a second human case of bird flu infection linked to the current outbreak in dairy cows. The farm worker had only mild symptoms and has since recovered, and officials have stressed that the risk to the public from H5N1 remains low. But influenza viruses are notorious for their evolutionary capacity, and if this one were to become endemic in dairy cows, that would increase the potential risks to people.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_molteni@statnews.com", "name": "Megan Molteni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stat (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microbiologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1221901314-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1931, "textEnd": 1939}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 3000, "textEnd": 3007}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Scientists say it's only a matter of time before it reaches Australia.\n\nAntarctica is home to some of the world's most unique animals.\n\nNow, scores of them are dying in \"mass mortality events\", the likes of which the continent has never seen.\n\nThe bodies of Ad\u00e9lie penguins and skuas are lined up on the snow and ice as a deadly, mutating pathogen continues its unrelenting spread, infecting new species of birds and mammals across the globe.\n\n\"It was quite devastating, every couple of metres you're finding another dead bird,\" Australian researcher Dr Meagan Dewar told 7.30.\n\nA multinational crew of scientists led by Dr Dewar made the grim Antarctic finding on their most recent disease surveillance expedition in March.\n\nAmong the casualties were dozens of skuas -- the big brown seagull-like birds had suffered a sudden death.\n\n\"It's devastating that we may have lost a population, just as we've discovered it,\" Dr Dewar told 7.30.\n\nWith a theory in mind, they ran experiments to be sure.\n\nTaking tissue samples from the skua carcasses aboard their yacht, they performed tests, similar to the sequencing of COVID-19.\n\nTheir findings, while not unexpected, did come with a heavy reality.\n\nA mutated strain of the virus we know as \"bird flu\" had penetrated the world's most remote continent.\n\n\"Sadly it's something we predicted; it was something that was going to happen.\"\n\nWhile the extent of the pathogen's spread in Antarctica remains unknown, tests are being conducted to find out what killed thousands of Ad\u00e9lie penguins on nearby Heroina Island.\n\nDr Dewar said there were clues to indicate sudden death as their bodies appeared healthy and many had food in their stomachs.\n\n\"It indicates most likely [the cause of death was] an infectious disease of some sort,\" she told 7.30.\n\nSamples from the penguins are still being analysed.\n\nHeroina is classified as the third-largest Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony in the world.\n\nThere are now concerns for all bird and mammal species across the continent.\n\n\"Now that it's moved onto the peninsula, there's a greater risk it'll spread to other parts of Antarctica,\" Dr Dewar said.\n\nSkuas are known to frequently move between animal populations across Antarctica, and could potentially spread the virus to penguin colonies next season.\n\n\"We do know there are species that mix with similar species from different populations during winter, so there's a chance of [further] spreading the virus and taking it back to their colonies,\" Dr Dewar said.\n\nThe working theory for the Antarctic spread is relatively simple, and commonly attributed to most other bird flu outbreaks: wild birds.\n\nIn this case, it's suspected infected skuas carried the virus from the sub-Antarctic Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island, where there were several known hotspots - including infections in mammals.\n\nThose sub-Antarctic cases were introduced by birds who carried the deadly strain from South America, which has seen bird populations decimated in recent years.\n\nDevelopments have been closely monitored and logged by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and show a clearly defined route.\n\nVirus Ecologist Dr Michelle Wille has been tracking bird flu for years.\n\n\"The worst-case scenario is arriving at penguin colonies that are silent, arriving at places where there should be abundant wildlife and having nothing.\n\n\"It's very hard to predict what's going to happen in the next season, or even this winter.\"\n\nBird flu isn't anything new.\n\nIt became a well-known virus in the late 1990s, when an outbreak in a Hong Kong poultry market resulted in the deaths of several people.\n\nThe disease then appeared in other birds and poultry throughout Asia, before breaching Europe, spreading into Africa, and reaching the Americas.\n\nThere have been more strains between then and now but since 2020, a mutated strain of bird flu has had unprecedented impacts on poultry and wild birds on a global scale.\n\nIt's officially labelled HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.\n\nIt is often referred to as \"H5N1\".\n\nIn the context of infectious diseases, scientists agree this is the worst ecological disaster yet.\n\n\"I don't think any of us could have imagined it's been as bad as it is now, but since 2020-21, things have gotten to a whole new level,\" Dr Wille told 7.30.\n\n\"The scale of the mortalities is also something we've never seen before and there's no evidence that it's stopping any time soon.\"\n\nArguably, the most confronting supporting evidence comes from South America.\n\nIn Peru, at least 40 per cent of the native pelican population has been wiped out.\n\nMore than 10 per cent of the penguin species have been affected as well.\n\nAnd this strain is not just killing birds -- more than 10 per cent of sea lions have died across the continent.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nGlobally, more than 500 bird species have been affected, and more than 60 mammalians.\n\nIn poultry, some of the worst outbreaks have been recorded in the United States. The Centre for Disease Control estimates total losses exceeding 90 million chickens and turkeys across 48 states.\n\nAnd the most recent unexpected developments with bird flu have come in the US.\n\nAuthorities there are dealing with the fallout from a peculiar \"spillover\" event -- which is when animals pass the virus to other species.\n\nSomehow, a herd of dairy cattle became infected, spreading it to other bovines, and to at least one person - a farmer who reported having mild flu symptoms, and conjunctivitis.\n\nThe transmission to multiple species and humans has raised questions.\n\nWhile this strain has jumped species and finds new hosts with ease scientists say there is little concern for humans at present.\n\nA team of Australian scientists at the CSIRO's Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) are an authority on the matter and back that statement.\n\nDr Frank Wong, who is a global authority on avian flu, described humans as \"dead-end hosts\", which means once a person is infected they cannot pass it on to others.\n\n\"In the few cases where people have got infected, they've mainly been people at the front lines dealing with the outbreak or infection,\" Dr Wong told 7.30.\n\n\"The virus still hasn't been able to easily transmit from a mammalian host - from person-to-person or mammal-to-mammal.\"\n\nDr Wong and others know this because of their research, which takes place in an airtight high-biosecurity laboratory, where they're growing the latest H5N1 strain to study it more closely.\n\nThe virus is injected into eggs and replicates itself, before being harvested.\n\nThis is also how some vaccines are developed.\n\nSo if the day ever comes when we need one for bird flu, they already know how to develop it.\n\nNo one is certain, but the highest risk period for Australia is theorised to be from September - the start of Spring.\n\nThat's when migratory birds are expected to make their return from Europe.\n\nThe first place of incursion depends on which birds (species and populations) are involved.\n\nShorebirds stop along the top end of Australia first - where places like Broome are important sites.\n\nBut some fly directly to the country's southern parts, bypassing the top end.\n\nIf it arrives with seabirds, like muttonbirds, it would first arrive at their colonies, and this could be across many places.\n\nSome sectors are watching more closely than others.\n\nAustralia's poultry industry, which has fallen victim to a number of past deadly outbreaks, including previous strains of bird flu, has increased biosecurity to its strictest level yet.\n\nA bleak picture has been painted in Australia's Avian Influenza Plan, written by a National Biosecurity Committee.\n\nIt suggests our domestic economy could suffer from a widespread outbreak and disruptions within the poultry sector.\n\nExport markets for chicken products would \"likely close immediately\".\n\nIt predicted other industries, including tourism, would be affected.\n\nThere are grave concerns for wildlife too, with a widespread outbreak potentially reversing \"decades of conservation efforts\".\n\nThere are currently 163 bird species considered either critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable and those could be pushed closer to extinction.\n\n\"Sometimes that's the last nail in the coffin for some species,\" Dr Wille said.\n\n\"They never recover from something like that, it can be catastrophic.\n\n\"The most important thing we can do is monitor ... but I don't think there's any way to stop it once it's in Australian wild birds.\"\n\nAdmitting an outbreak is unavoidable doesn't mean the outlook is hopeless.\n\nFor several years, state, territory and federal governments have been preparing and considering an incursion to be inevitable.\n\nYou can't stop wild birds at the border, so enhanced surveillance is the key to spotting and controlling any outbreaks.\n\n\"Our teams here keep a close eye on genetic evolution of the virus and we know what new strains are emerging as the virus spreads in different parts of the world - particularly in our region,\" Dr Wong told 7.30.\n\n\"With influenza we never say never, but we are confident that we're well prepared for any possible incursion.\"\n\nIn a country as vast as Australia, the public plays an important role too.\n\nWe're being asked to immediately report any unusual bird deaths to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.\n\nHealth authorities have also warned against handling sick or dead birds.", "source":

(WOOD) -- The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development says three more dairy herds across the state have been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu.\n\nThe positive tests came in over the past week. The herds are in Clinton, Gratiot and Ionia counties.\n\nEighteen dairy herds have now contracted the virus since late March when the first infection was confirmed in Montcalm County. Those infections are now across nine Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Clinton, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm and Ottawa.\n\n\"What is happening with HPAI in Michigan mirrors what is happening in states across the country,\" MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring said in a press briefing. \"This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert. This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities.\"\n\nMultiple federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, say the commercial milk supply is safe because of pasteurization and federal animal health requirements.\n\n\"If animals are sick, they are not allowed to have that milk go into the bulk tank for sale. That milk is pulled,\" Michigan State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said. \"The animals are not quarantined. We ask the herds to restrict movements and only move animals if absolutely necessary to be moved.\"\n\nHPAI is a highly contagious virus that can spread from infected wild birds to other animals through an item exposed to the virus, like equipment, feed or even the clothes of the caretakers. In rare cases, humans can contract the virus.\n\nA farm worker in Texas tested positive for HPAI last month, the second human case ever on record in the United States.\n\nThe current HPAI outbreak, which sparked in February of 2022, has now affected more than 90 million birds nationwide, making it the worst outbreak of bird flu in American history. While HPAI is almost always fatal in birds, the mortality rate is considered low in cows.\n\nThose who suspect avian flu in their domestic animals are asked to call MDARD immediately at 800.292.3939

poultry deaths at an egg farm near Meredith, south of Ballarat.\n\nAgriculture Victoria confirmed that preliminary tests detected the presence of the avian influenza virus, otherwise known as bird flu.\n\nThe property has been placed into quarantine and samples have been sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, which is based nearby in Geelong.\n\nThe department said the tests that would be conducted there would determine the type and nature of the disease.\n\nVictorian Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke said Agriculture Victoria staff were at the farm.\n\n\"Poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners are urged to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888, or to your local vet,\" he said.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious virus that affects bird species and can spread to other species, including humans.\n\nThere are many types of bird flu.\n\nThe disease was last detected in Australia in 2020, when it was found on an egg farm south of Ballarat.\n\nThis resulted in multiple outbreaks in Victoria and led to tens of thousands of farmed birds being euthanased.\n\nAt the moment there is a global outbreak of the disease, which has been detected in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, South America and Antarctica.\n\nAgriculture Victoria is urging all poultry and bird owners to follow biosecurity practices such keeping poultry sheds, yards, aviaries and equipment clean and restricting contact between poultry and wild birds.\n\nBird owners should also ensure their footwear is clean, always wash their hands before and after handling birds or eggs, and quarantine new birds before integrating them with flocks.\n\nConsumers should not be concerned about eggs and poultry products from the supermarkets -- they do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

Picasso is a veterinarian and epidemiologist, specializing in transboundary infectious diseases in both livestock and wildlife animal populations. Rodriguez is a dairy health epidemiologist and dairy extension faculty member. O'Connor is a world-renowned veterinarian and expert in the application of quantitative epidemiology to improve policy on food safety, animal health and welfare, and veterinary practices.\n\nAccording to the USDA, as of mid-May, H5N1 infections have been detected in dozens of dairy herds across Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. The virus, which was first detected in domestic birds in the US in 2022 but not until recently in cattle, has been identified in unpasteurized milk, as well as swabs and tissue samples from sick cattle.\n\nSymptoms may include reduced milk production, decreased appetite, and changes in milk color and consistency.\n\n\"Immediately upon the onset of the H5N1 outbreak in Michigan dairy cattle, MSU AgBioResearch, the College of Veterinary Medicine and MDARD began conversations about research questions that when answered could inform policy and management strategies to help prevent transmission within and across dairy herds,\" said James Averill, assistant director of MSU AgBioResearch and leader of the organization's animal agriculture initiatives. \"This research will enable the dairy industry to better understand H5N1 and the impacts on dairy herds over time.\"\n\nThe research team will seek to answer several key questions, such as:\n\n\"There's still an enormous amount of information we don't know,\" O'Connor said. \"This outbreak underscored the critical need to understand the dynamics, impact and prevention of H5N1 among the cattle population. We are fortunate to be able to ground this research in on-farm studies, working closely with MDARD to access farms that have had herds test positive for the virus.\"\n\nThe team plans to conduct five studies on farms with H5N1-positive animals. They will study lactating cows, dry cows and calves, collecting blood, nasal swabs and milk samples to be tested. All H5N1 testing is being performed by the MSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, the only laboratory in Michigan approved by the USDA to test for highly pathogenic avian influenza in any species.\n\nAdditionally, researchers will examine milking equipment for H5N1 presence and compare testing accuracy between pooled and individual samples.\n\nData from Michigan farms will be combined with findings from other universities nationwide for a comprehensive analysis.\n\n\"We're trying to understand how long animals are shedding the virus and how long the virus stays active,\" O'Connor said. \"For example, if we were to find that cattle are often positive on nasal swabs, we might conclude that nose-to-nose contact is a common route of transmission. Likewise, we may see that some samples come back negative quite often and show that those routes are much less likely. The overall goal is to equip our producers with the information needed to make informed decisions on how to best protect their cattle, and by extension, animal safety more broadly.\"", "source":

Each was quickly contained and eradicated, according to the government.\n\nAustralia is the only continent that has so far remained free of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that has spread globally in recent months, killing hundreds of millions of poultry and causing turmoil in food supply chains.\n\nThe H5N1 strain has also killed huge numbers of wild birds and spread to tens of mammal species, raising fears of human transmission.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N7", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/45wUdv1Cttr_Pq1H2sm7JnDVHWennjbcTln4cLHw7yq0fBpVeH4s0hhZKOd4_yPahpZqE2MENrYRR2EktjMYdKLLquZEXt7EMMUW=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Despite this alarming statistic, there seems to be a cloud of secrecy surrounding the situation. Crucial information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) remains elusive, leaving the public and media in the dark.\n\n37 Out Of 300 People In America Who Have Been Exposed To\n\nAnimals Infected With H5N1 Have Developed Flu-Like Symptoms\n\nInformation Scarcity and Agency Silence\n\nAttempts to gather comprehensive data on the H5N1 situation have been met with resistance. Official websites occasionally update their pages with fragmented pieces of information, making it incredibly challenging to obtain a clear picture of the unfolding events. Moreover, authorities are tight-lipped, often refusing to respond to media inquiries on critical points. Local American H5N1 News coverages are only focusing on the infections concerning the dairy cows, poultry, contaminated milk issue etc but none conducting any decent investigative journalism as to what is actually going on with the 300 humans currently being monitored by the U.S. CDC or even about the current status of the initial migrant worker who had contracted H5N1 in a dairy farm in Texas.\n\nRecently, the number of individuals being investigated by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for potential H5N1 infections has surged. Many of these individuals have been placed in isolation.\n\nThe latest update from the CDC revealed that 37 out of 300 people under investigation have exhibited flu-like symptoms. These individuals had direct contact with animals such as cows, chickens, dogs, cats, or other wildlife known to carry the H5N1 virus.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2023-2024/bird-flu-update_05172024.html\n\nRising Suspicion and Speculation\n\nDespite ongoing investigations, there has been no official confirmation regarding the pathogens affecting these 37 individuals. The CDC and other relevant agencies have claimed that none of the cases tested positive for H5N1. This raises significant questions, as diagnostic tests for other respiratory infections typically yield results within 24 hours. They should by now be able to tell the media as to what pathogens are causing the flu-like symptoms in these individuals if it's not H5N1.\n\nThe prolonged silence has fueled speculation that a new reassortant strain of H5N1 might be responsible for these infections. (This can be conveniently classified as being none H5N1!)\n\nInside Sources Speak Out\n\nIn a startling revelation, anonymous sources within the U.S. CDC ha ve disclosed that many of the 37 affected individuals are displaying symptoms beyond the typical flu-like signs. These include red eye infections, dysautonomia, severe headaches, and even cognitive and neuropsychiatric issues. The mysterious nature of these symptoms adds another layer of complexity and urgency to the situation.\n\nMonitoring and Testing Efforts\n\nThe CDC continues to support states in monitoring individuals who have had exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. To date, over 300 people have been under surveillance due to their contact with animals carrying the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. Among these, at least 37 have developed flu-like symptoms and have been subjected to targeted testing. So far, all but one case in Texas have tested negative. However, the ambiguity surrounding the nature of these infections persists, as confirmatory testing is conducted at both state and local levels, with the CDC stepping in when necessary.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nThe situation demands urgent attention and transparency from the relevant authorities. The public deserves to know the full extent of the threat posed by H5N1 and the measures being taken to address it. The secrecy and lack of clear communication only serve to heighten anxiety and mistrust.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it is crucial for the CDC, FDA, USDA, and other agencies to provide timely and accurate updates. The health and safety of the population depend on open communication and a robust response to potential outbreaks.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nWith the specter of a potential new strain of H5N1 looming, the need for vigilance and preparedness has never been more critical. Public health agencies must work together to identify the cause of the infections and implement effective containment and treatment strategies. The lessons learned from past outbreaks should guide current efforts to mitigate the impact of H5N1 on public health.\n\nIn the meantime, the public is urged to stay informed through reliable sources and adhere to recommended health practices to minimize the risk of infection. The road ahead may be uncertain, but with concerted effort and transparency, it is possible to navigate this public health challenge.\n\nFor the latest H5N1 News updates, keep on logging to Thailand Medical News.\n\nRead Also:\n\nhttps://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-h5n1-genotype-affecting-cows-in-america-possibly-gains-entry-into-humans-via-the-eyes-thru-the-new-pb2-e67k-mutation\n\nor check out: https://www.thailandmedical.news/articles/h5n1-avian-flu", "source": {"uri": "thailandmedical.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Home - Thailand Medical News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza-like illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dysautonomia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.thailandmedical.news/uploads/news/664aec826504e_H5N1-News-U.S.-CDC-Says-That-37-Out-Of-300-People-In-America-Who-Have-Been-Exposed-To-Animals-Infected-With-H5N1-Have-Developed-Flu-Like-Symptoms.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus caused a flurry of preventative measures in 2002-04, and actually reached a global alert status from the World Health Organization in 2003.\n\nThe H1N1 swine flu actually became a pandemic in 2009, creating a rush on vaccinations, and killed an estimated 284,000 worldwide before the pandemic was officially declared to have ended in 2010.\n\nViruses are tricky, changing things, and all of the ones mentioned above had the opportunity to spread globally, but either were stopped or failed to successfully adapt.\n\nThen came COVID-19.\n\nMention the virus that brought much of the world to a stop, and you're bound to get a variety of opinions, but the confirmed number of deaths from the virus worldwide has reached above seven million, and that rate continues to slowly rise, with 3,000 deaths worldwide in the first 28 days of April alone. There are likely more: not all COVID deaths are believed to have been accounted for, through lack of testing in some regions.\n\nDire early predictions about the virus as it spread in China -- the same sorts of concerns about the other viruses above -- turned out to be more than accurate.\n\nNow, there's a new kid in virus-town.\n\nThe H5N1 bird flu has taken root in Texas cattle country, with virus fragments even found in cows' milk. The virus has been found in dairy operations in six different states, namely Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas.\n\nLast week, though, marked a new benchmark for the virus: there was scientific proof that the virus had adapted to spread from birds to cows, and sometimes (though rarely) from birds to humans, but for the first time, there's a confirmed case of a cow-to-human transmission.\n\nThe concern is that the virus is evolving, as virus do -- and that's especially a concern because H5N1 is classed as a highly pathogenic virus, meaning it spreads quickly and easily.\n\nNone of that means a new pandemic is lurking around the corner -- although the World Health Organization is warning the virus has to be watched closely. The fact is that the way to get out in front of any potential pandemic is to do the necessary legwork on how and why a virus is spreading.\n\nAnd the research that needs to be done -- and is being done -- isn't always solely applicable to the virus that's being studied.\n\nResearch that was done in the past on MERS actually gave researchers a leg-up on treatments for COVID, because of their work the role of a spike protein in MERS. A similar spike-protein mechanism in COVID helped that virus enter human cells.\n\nIt's fashionable for some reason right now to demean scientific expertise -- in fact, to demean any kind of specialized knowledge. We forget at our peril that a tremendous amount of work is being on viruses like H5N1, precisely to keep them from becoming pandemics.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MERS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H1N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_spike_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus spike protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/2323670_web1_TPH302_2023020813-CPT638114402108903334.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

None of the states were identified.\n\nThe samples represented products produced at 132 different locations across 38 states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Kansas, and Texas.\n\n\"The location of where milk was processed does not indicate where the milk was produced. This is because milk could be produced from cows on a farm or farms a few states away, processed (pasteurized) in a different state, and then be available for purchase in yet another state,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nFDA officials said earlier this month that some milk samples from retailers tested positive for the influenza, also known as the bird flu. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests used can detect remnants of a virus, indicating past infection. The FDA said that follow-up testing identified no live virus in the samples and maintained the nation's milk supply is safe.\n\nIn the update on Monday, the FDA said 1 percent milk was most likely to test positive. Out of 1 percent milk samples, 32.1 percent tested positive, compared with 27.6 percent of 2 percent milk samples, 23.5 percent of whole milk samples, and 11.1 percent of skim milk samples.\n\nMultiple samples of cream, half and half, and sour cream tested positive for the avian influenza, along with a single sample of cottage cheese. No samples of yogurt tested positive.\n\n\"As noted previously, qRT-PCR-positive results do not necessarily represent live virus that may be a risk to consumers. Therefore, viability testing by egg inoculation was performed on the qPCR samples that were positive for viral nucleic acid. All of these samples did not detect any viable virus,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe samples were collected between April 18 and April 22.\n\nWhile describing milk and dairy products as safe, the FDA also said that it was conducting a study on pasteurization to \"further validate pasteurization effectiveness\" against bird flu. Preliminary results \"are expected in the near future,\" according to the agency.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said on May 16 that testing of ground beef inoculated with a bird flu surrogate showed cooking burgers to at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit killed the virus, although the virus was still detected in burgers cooked to 120 degrees.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest update that it is working on enhancing monitoring for the bird flu with the goal of identifying all cases. \"More information on this will be forthcoming,\" the agency stated.\n\nAuthorities first began identifying cases of the bird flu in cattle earlier this year. Government scientists say the cases likely started in late 2023. As of May 20, cases have been confirmed in 51 herds across nine states: Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas.\n\nOne human case, in Texas, has been confirmed this year.\n\nInfections among other animals have also been detected. The number of cases in cats is up to 10, according to reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Two domestic cats became infected recently even though they were not in contact with any birds or cattle with the flu, authorities in Campbell County, South Dakota told the organization.\n\nIt wasn't clear if the cats survived.\n\nSome cats in Texas died after drinking raw milk from infected cows and contracting the bird flu, researchers reported in a recent study. Symptoms included stiff movements and blindness.\n\nHealth authorities recommend keeping cats inside when possible and heat-treating or pasteurizing milk before feeding it to animals.", "source":

In new results published yesterday, scientists from WastewaterSCAN detected significant levels of H5 influenza in three treatment plants in communities where H5N1 has been detected in cattle.\n\nIn other developments, a dairy specialist from Michigan State University Extension posted a case report on an outbreak at a Michigan dairy farm, which suggests that the symptoms in cows were more profound than previously described and outlines the challenges farmers have in containing the virus.\n\nScientists from WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, published their findings yesterday in Environmental Science and Technology Letters.\n\nThe group's findings come amid other efforts to track the spread of the virus through wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week launched its own wastewater surveillance dashboard, which tracks influenza A, including H5N1. Also, researchers from Texas recently found H5N1 virus sequences in wastewater 9 of 10 Texas cities they sampled.\n\nUsing an H5 probe they developed, the WastewaterSCAN team found significant H5 and influenza A levels in retrospective wastewater solids samples from four wastewater treatment plants in communities near H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle, three in Texas (two in Amarillo and one in Dallas) and one in Forsyth County, North Carolina. For comparison, they examined samples from the same period from Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nThe spikes in H5 and influenza A levels occurred right before and during the confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows in the Texas panhandle. For example, they said retrospective testing from Amarillo showed that H5 was present on February 25 -- a week before an unspecified disease was reported in Texas cows.\n\n\"This work shows that wastewater monitoring can provide an early warning for outbreaks likely to produce contributions to the sewershed outside of the expected human-associated inputs, including for animal outbreaks of diseases with zoonotic potential,\" the team wrote.\n\nThey hypothesized that dairy-processing discharge into the sewage system is driving the detection of H5 identified in wastewater solids, but they also said the detections could also be coming from other animals and humans.\n\nThe researchers emphasized that the test can't identify the species that shed the H5 virus. They added, however, that emergency room data from Texas suggest that the virus wasn't from a human source.\n\nAlso, the authors said the probe detects H5 broadly and isn't specific to H5N1, meaning it may pick up low-pathogenic H5 influenza viruses.\n\nThe group said they will use the H5 probe to test samples from all 190 WastewaterSCAN sites and will share the information with local public health officials and on its dashboard.\n\nThe MSU Extension report, by field-based educator Phil Durst, said a farmer willingly shared the information and agreed to testing to help other farmers. Michigan has reported 18 outbreaks over nine counties, the most of any state.\n\nThe event began on May 1, and the report details what unfolded over the next 15 days. The herd has 500 cows, and the outbreak began in a barn that had two pens with three water fountains, including a shared one at the center. The first symptoms were spikes in body temperature, which lasted about 2 days and resulted in severe dehydration. Some cows aborted their calves, likely due to high body temperatures.\n\nFarm workers, who have remained healthy so far, tried to contain the outbreak to the barn and changed the wash cycle after milking the affected group, but the virus spread to all lactating cattle on the farm.\n\nHandling the sick cows was very labor-intensive and also took time away from breeding activities. The farmer estimated that the outbreak has cost $30,000 to $40,000 so far, when factoring in medical care, labor, loss of milk, and loss of pregnancies.", "source": {"uri": "cidrap.umn.edu",

The transmission method among cattle remains unclear. However, a study published in Nature Communications revealed that a similar H5N1 strain, subtype clade 2.3.4.4b, which previously caused an outbreak in farmed mink in 2022, was capable of airborne transmission to a small group of ferrets.\n\nThis is the first time that a member of the group of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses has been shown to exhibit this ability. According to the Penn State researchers who led the study, the findings suggest these viruses are evolving to infect mammals and with potentially increased risk to humans.\n\n\"While there is no evidence that the strain of H5N1 that is presently affecting dairy cattle is capable of airborne transmission, our study suggests that another member of this family of viruses has evolved some degree of airborne transmissibility,\" said Troy Sutton, associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences, Penn State, and corresponding author on the paper. \"This finding underscores the importance of continued surveillance to monitor the evolution of these viruses and their spillover into other mammals, including humans.\"\n\nAccording to the researchers, assessing a virus's potential for airborne transmission in mammals could inform the understanding of its potential risk to humans. Since virus samples could not be readily obtained after the outbreak in mink had been controlled, the team reconstructed the virus using publicly available genetic sequences.\n\nNext, the researchers evaluated the ability of the virus to transmit in ferrets, which have respiratory tracts that are more similar to humans in their susceptibility to viral infection and transmission than other model organisms, such as mice. The team measured both direct transmission of the virus by placing infected ferrets in cages with uninfected ferrets and indirect airborne transmission by placing infected and uninfected ferrets in cages that enabled shared airspace but prevented physical contact. To assess disease severity, the team examined the ferrets' weight loss and signs of clinical illness.\n\nThe researchers found that the virus was transmitted by direct contact to 75% of exposed ferrets and by respiratory droplets to 37.5% of exposed ferrets after about nine days of exposure. The team also found that the virus had a low infectious dose, meaning that even small amounts of virus caused an infection.\n\nSutton noted that the mink strain of the virus contained a mutation, called PB2 T271A. To test the influence of this mutation on viral transmission and disease severity, the team engineered the virus without the mutation and found that mortality and airborne transmission in the ferrets infected with this version of the virus were reduced.\n\n\"These findings suggest that the PB2 T271A mutation is enhancing viral replication of the virus, contributing to both virulence and transmission in ferrets,\" Sutton said. \"Understanding the role that this mutation plays means we can monitor for it or for similar mutations to arise in the currently circulating strains of H5N1.\"\n\nSutton added that the ferrets that the team used in its studies had no preexisting immunity to influenza, whereas the majority of humans have been exposed to H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses.\n\n\"This exposure would likely offer some degree of cross-protection against H5N1 if humans are exposed to another H5N1 variant,\" he said.\n\nFurthermore, he said that the transmission rate the team observed in the mink virus is lower than is typical for pandemic influenza viruses.\n\n\"Pandemic influenza viruses typically transmit via the airborne route to 75% to 100% of contacts within three to five days, whereas the mink virus we studied transmitted to fewer than 40% of contacts after nine days,\" Sutton said. \"The transmission observed in our studies is indicative of increased pandemic potential relative to previously characterized strains of H5N1; however, the mink virus does not exhibit the same attributes as pandemic strains. The H5N1 strain affecting cattle also has not caused severe disease in cattle or humans, but the longer the virus circulates, and the more exposure humans have to it, the greater the chances that it will evolve to infect humans.\"\n\nReference: \"Risk assessment of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus from mink\" by Katherine H.

That's an old saying about an old clock.\n\nTruth is, if your digital clock is broken, it's almost certainly just dark, and as a result, never right.\n\nBut the sentiments in the saying are clear: predict an outcome often enough, and you're likely to be right once in a while, even if it's for the wrong reasons.\n\nThis is all a strange way, perhaps, to be talking about the threats of new viruses and the chances of another pandemic.\n\nLook back at the not-too-distant past, and you can find a number of viruses that looked like they could have caused pandemics, but didn't go global: there was MERS, the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which first appeared in 2012. SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus caused a flurry of preventative measures from 2002 to 2004, and actually reached a global alert status from the World Health Organization in 2003.\n\nThe H1N1 swine flu actually became a pandemic in 2009, creating a rush on vaccinations, and killed an estimated 284,000 worldwide before the pandemic was officially declared to have ended in 2010.\n\nViruses are tricky, changing things, and all of the ones mentioned above had the opportunity to spread globally, but either were stopped or failed to successfully adapt.\n\nThen came COVID-19.\n\nMention the virus that brought much of the world to a stop, and you're bound to get a variety of opinions, but the confirmed number of deaths from the virus worldwide has reached above seven million, and that rate continues to slowly rise, with 3,000 deaths worldwide in the first 28 days of April alone. There are likely more: not all COVID deaths are believed to have been accounted for, through lack of testing in some regions.\n\nDire early predictions about the virus as it spread in China -- the same sorts of concerns about the other viruses above -- turned out to be more than accurate.\n\nNow, there's a new kid in virus-town.\n\nThe H5N1 bird flu has taken root in Texas cattle country, with virus fragments even found in cows' milk. The virus has been found in dairy operations in six different states, namely Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas.\n\nRecently, though, came a new benchmark for the virus: there was scientific proof that the virus had adapted to spread from birds to cows, and sometimes (though rarely) from birds to humans, but for the first time, there's a confirmed case of a cow-to-human transmission.\n\nThe concern is that the virus is evolving, as viruses do -- and that's especially a concern because H5N1 is classed as a highly pathogenic virus, meaning it spreads quickly and easily.\n\nNone of that means a new pandemic is lurking around the corner -- although the World Health Organization is warning the virus has to be watched closely.\n\nThe fact is that the way to get out in front of any potential pandemic is to do the necessary legwork on how and why a virus is spreading.\n\nAnd the research that needs to be done -- and is being done -- isn't always solely applicable to the virus that's being studied.\n\nResearch that was done in the past on MERS actually gave researchers a leg up on treatments for COVID because of their work on the role of a spike protein in MERS. A similar spike-protein mechanism in COVID helped that virus enter human cells.\n\nIt's fashionable for some reason right now to demean scientific expertise -- in fact, to demean any kind of specialized knowledge. And that's highly dangerous. The inexpert anti-vaccine movement has scared many parents into thinking their children are in danger from the content of vaccines, when in reality it's the other way around.\n\nThe resurgence of measles is a prime example. This dangerous virus was considered eliminated in Canada in 1998 and in the United States two years later, thanks to vaccinations. Now cases are rising around the world again. Just this month in Ontario, an unvaccinated child died as a result of the disease.\n\nWe forget at our peril humanity's fight against measles, polio, small pox and other dangerous diseases -- or that a tremendous amount of work is currently underway on viruses like H5N1, precisely to keep them from becoming pandemics.\n\nWe can't afford to stop that clock, or even turn it back.", "source": {"uri":

billion) investment follows concerns raised by public health experts that the US government was not \"doing enough to track the virus and prevent it from spreading to humans\", according to the agriculturedive.com website.\n\nAs part of the plan, US$100 million (R1,82 billion) would be set aside to assist dairy farmers affected by avian influenza, or bird flu, as it is commonly known, to implement biosecurity measures and take the necessary precautions to prevent the virus from spreading.\n\nREAD Biosecurity protocols to combat livestock diseases\n\nDairy operations affected would each be eligible for up to US$28 000 (R510 000) in funding over a 120-day period, and a range of financial incentives would be provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in an attempt to increase biosecurity and cover veterinary fees, as well as the cost of collecting and testing samples.\n\nIncluded in the funding would be US$2 000 (R36 300) per affected location per month to supply face masks and other personal protection equipment to workers as part of a health study.\n\nIn addition, dairy producers would be able to claim compensation for implementing effective biosecurity plans and establishing heat treatment systems to safely dispose of milk, agriculturedive.com reported.\n\nUS Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement: \"We want to make sure that we are doing what is necessary to provide producers on the ground with the most available and most scientific information and direction.\"\n\nAccording to a USDA online tracker, the virus had been detected in 42 dairy herds in nine states by 13 May.\n\nThe statement further said that the department would \"work with states as they consider movement restrictions on lactating cattle and soon begin offering payments to offset losses in milk production due to the virus\".\n\nVilsack stressed that there was no concern about the safety of that country's commercial milk and beef supplies, and the USDA \"continues to see affected cows recover from treatment with few deaths being reported\".\n\nHowever, public health experts were calling for \"a more coordinated, whole-of-government response to the outbreak to ensure that the virus does not mutate and spread to humans\".", "source": {"uri": "farmersweekly.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Farmer's Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri":

State and territorial epidemiologists in 55 jurisdictions were surveyed.\n\nThe researchers found that 91 percent of jurisdictions (50 jurisdictions) reported persons exposed to A(H5N1) virus-infected animals and monitored for symptoms. Of these, human exposures were reported in backyard flocks, commercial poultry, wild birds, and sick or dead mammals in 88, 82, 54, and 18 percent of jurisdictions, respectively. Overall, 59 percent of 49 jurisdictions with A(H5) virus testing capacity reported testing respiratory specimens from symptomatic persons since January 2022. Public health authorities reported difficulties in monitoring A(H5N1) virus-exposed persons due to personnel shortages or lack of funding in 66 percent of 50 jurisdictions. Overall, 19 of 50 respondents (38 percent) reported recommending empirical antiviral treatment before performing influenza testing for persons monitored after exposure to A(H5N1) virus who developed symptoms. One-third of the jurisdictions would recommend postexposure prophylaxis for close contacts of those with laboratory-confirmed A(H5N1).\n\n\"Challenges reported in monitoring exposed persons and differences in antiviral recommendations highlight the need to strengthen and standardize public health preparedness and response to HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in the U.S., particularly if additional animal-to-human A(H5N1) virus transmission events are reported,\" the authors write.", "source": {"uri": "healthday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "healthday.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elana_gotkine@healthday.com", "name": "Elana Gotkine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/healthday-en%2F2024-05%2Fc19625ab-aec3-4bcb-ba97-f33f78abc960%2FAdobeStock_170767323.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 198, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

In all, she lost 210 birds.\n\nToday, her small farm remains under a bio-secure quarantine, and her visits to feed shops and farmers' markets are far from normal.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to go into the feed stores,\" she said. \"I'm not allowed to pull up to the dock with my truck. I have to pull up a ways away, and they come out with a forklift and bring me whatever I need.\"\n\nLast week, Pineyro was permitted to return to the farmers' market, but with a caveat: she needs a permit every time.\n\nVisitors to her farm can pull up into her driveway and enter her house, but they're not permitted past a certain fenced-in section of the property.\n\nShe has to change her footwear before entering the quarantine zone.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) asked her to disinfect everything on her farm, such as large equipment, and the inside of her barn and poultry pens.\n\nLynn Hood, the regional veterinary officer for animal health for CFIA Atlantic, was unable to discuss Pineyro's case, but she did say it appears the virus is contained.\n\n\"We haven't had any detections,\" said Hood. \"So there's certainly no evidence to think that it has spread.\"\n\nPineyro said she found it impossible to completely disinfect her barn, greenhouse and the rest of her farm.\n\nThe only other CFIA-approved option was to seal off the barn and greenhouse, where some birds spent the winter, for 120 days. She can still let her swine and cows graze in their fenced-in spaces, but there's to be no poultry until Aug. 19.\n\n\"We have four months to go before we can set foot in our own barn,\" Pineyro said. \"My greenhouse is now off-limits, which means obviously there's no tomatoes growing in there.\"\n\nThough Pineyro said the situation has been \"incredibly frustrating,\" there have been some good moments.\n\nA local 4-H group spent a day on her farm cleaning some chicken coops, and neighbouring farmers have been generous with donations and offers to help. Pineyro said she estimates the bird flu infection cost her about $30,000.\n\nPineyro said the thought of another infection terrifies her. Still, she said she plans to raise poultry again, as soon as possible, provided the fallow period is a success.\n\nAccording to the CFIA, there have been two known cases of avian flu during the past two years. There are no active cases right now.\n\nHood said the spring and fall migratory periods are the highest-risk times for the spread of bird flu, which is most commonly transmitted when droppings from wild birds come into contact with poultry farms.\n\nAlthough cases are rare, people can become infected with avian flu through direct contact with an infected bird or a contaminated surface.

Unlike his counterpart Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has supposedly disagreed and quarreled with Fauci on different occasions, Redfield has argued with Fauci on the origins of Covid-19 and how to treat it. Redfield very early on claimed Covid-19 was the result of gain-of-function experimentation that leaked from a lab.\n\nNear the end of the interview, Redfield shifted his attention towards bird flu and the current spread that's going on right now. Redfield said:\n\n\"Right now, it takes five amino acid changes for it to be effectively infecting humans. That's a pretty heavy species barrier - but this virus is already in 26 mammal species, as you most recently saw cattle. But in the laboratory, I could make it highly infectious for humans in just months.\"\n\nRedfield warned that he believes bird flu will become the \"great pandemic\" because of lab manipulation to make it more infectious for humans.\n\nThat's the real threat. That's the real biosecurity threat that these university labs are doing bio-experiments that are intentionally modifying viruses - and I think bird flu is going to be the cause of the great pandemic - where they're teaching these viruses to be more infectious for humans.\n\nHe said, though the interviewer did not follow up on his remark.\n\nThis is not the first time Redfield has been vocal in affirmatively saying he believes bird flu will be the next pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, The WinePress cited an interview appearance on the Trinitarian Broadcasting Network (TBN) where Redfield warned bird flu would be the next great pandemic, with a lethality of 10-50%, warning that the government needs to make preparing for this the number one priority.\n\nYeah I think we have to recognize - I've always said that I think the Covid pandemic was a wakeup call. I don't believe it's the great pandemic.\n\nI believe the great pandemic is still in the future, and that's going to be a bird flu pandemic for man. It's gonna have significant mortality in the 10-50% range. It's gonna be trouble.\n\nAnd we should get great prepared for it. I do believe the pandemic risk is a greater risk of the national security of the United States more than [North] Korea, China, Russia, Iran; and we ought to start investing proportional to that national security risk so that we're prepared.\n\nUnfortunately we're not more prepared today then when the [Covid-19] pandemic, when I was [the] CDC Director. And we need to make proportional investment so that we are prepared, not the least of which is enhancing our manufacturing capability.\n\nSo now that we have new technology like the mRNA technology: it's great that I can make a vaccine in 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks. But it doesn't help me if I can't manufacture 330 million doses.\n\nSo, this is a serious issue. I don't think our politicians are focused on the magnitude of this issue. This needs to be approached with a budgetary perspective measured in multiple aircraft carriers, not in the 5, 8,10 million dollar budget we spend on public health on this nation.\n\nMoreover, in 2023 Redfield was even more adamant in an interview with The Hill, this time specifying that the 'great pandemic' of bird flu would be a result of gain-of-function escaping a laboratory.\n\nI do believe the next pandemic, and we're going to have another pandemic and I think it's going to be the great pandemic. I consider Covid a minor pandemic, the great pandemic's going to come.\n\nAnd normally, it would come from spillover - bird flu that learns how to transmit to humans and then go to human-to-human. But I think the species barriers are very real.\n\nBut it's much more probable that it will happen because of gain-of-function research in a laboratory and then escape and then we're going to have a pandemic... which will be much more brutal to the world than Covid was.\n\nI told you that the great pandemic is coming. I think it's gonna come not from spillover, it's going to come from gain-of-function research or intentional bioterrorism. Alright, it's going to be a bird flu virus that is manipulated to be able to transmit human-to-human, very similar to what we saw with Covid.\n\nYou know in 2014 that laboratory published that they finally learned to take their Covid virus, and have it bind to the H2 receptor and humanize mice, and therefore it could go human-to-human.\n\nHe said at the time.\n\nCurrently the mainstream media, and national and global health organizations have been incessantly warning about the spread of bird flu in meat and dairy, to other animals and people especially.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

Look a little deeper though and it quickly becomes evident that they are integral to one another's success.\n\nThe US dairy sector needs to be involved with the UN because the US is a primary dairy supplier to global markets, and the UN recommends policies that many countries adopt into national law. We want policy makers to support science-based decision making that recognizes the critical role of US dairy exports in sustainable food systems.\n\nThe UN should care about US dairy and dairy trade because the dairy we produce can be a catalyst in meeting its sustainable development goals (SDGs). The UN has 17 SDGs, and dairy production and consumption can contribute to all of them, including ending poverty (SDG 1), eliminating hunger (SDG 2), supporting good health and well-being (SDG 3) and doing it all while combating climate change (SDG 13).\n\nTo start, dairy is an economic engine. One billion people worldwide rely on the dairy sector for their livelihoods either through milk production or in industries that support the dairy sector, such as feed and fertilizer production, logistics and processing. The US dairy industry recognizes and supports the economic role dairy plays in communities around the globe.\n\nDairy trade is not a one-sided, predatory, winner-take-all proposition as some would have you believe. Trade can give dairy producers everywhere access to international markets and helps grow domestic markets. Increasing dairy trade can increase consumption, and increasing dairy consumption delivers benefits to all parties.\n\nThe US dairy relationship with Mexico is a perfect example. Over the past two decades, US dairy exports to Mexico increased from $259 million to over $2.3 billion. At the same time, Mexico's domestic milk production jumped 36%, with steady expansion virtually every year. Cooperation between the US and Mexican dairy industries helped to grow per capita consumption to the benefit of both sides.\n\nCross-border collaboration on nutritional education, innovative product development, dairy promotion and simply providing consumers with more choices supported mutual dairy sector growth. In addition, with access to U.S. dairy products and ingredients, Mexico's food and beverage manufacturing sector has thrived using both local and imported products.\n\nThe work has supported dairy farmers, created domestic food industry jobs and enhanced the economic well-being for thousands, with particular benefits to rural communities. It also increased access to nutritious dairy foods for the more than 126 million people who live in Mexico.\n\nThe UN must not overlook that dairy trade also delivers irreplaceable nutrition. Dairy consumption has specific health and nutrition benefits for people across all life stages, particularly children, pregnant women and older adults. It has been shown to be protective against certain cancers and chronic conditions like hypertension, stroke, obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nAnd trade in dairy products creates a more resilient food system, increasing access to nutritious dairy and cushioning shocks and stresses. Trade has never been more important than it is now to ensure those in need -- the hungry or malnourished -- receive optimal nutrition as consistently and expediently as possible. When we trade, we not only trade in products. We trade in ideas. Our trade relationships create a channel to exchange knowledge about US dairy sustainability, technology, farming practices and nutrition.\n\nThe US dairy industry is a proven leader in increasing milk output while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the North American region, where the U.S. is the primary milk producer, reduced GHG emissions intensity by 2.2% per year from 2005 to 2015 even as milk production increased 2.1% annually. And we haven't stopped striving to improve since. Working together with partners across the country, we have taken several concrete steps toward reaching our industry wide goal of GHG neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe US is an exemplary model for milk producers across the globe. Working together across borders, we can accelerate the implementation of proven strategies to help achieve our shared goal of increasing efficiency and reducing environmental impact while continuing to supply nutritious milk and dairy products.\n\nWhy should the UN care about dairy trade? Because trade and US dairy exports are solutions for delivering sustainable food systems that nourish our growing global population. The world will not meet its sustainable development goals without dairy.\n\nOpen trade and science-based policies are the framework that ensures that we get safe food where it is most needed and do it consistently, competitively and cost-effectively.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_13", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_food_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable food system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Green_Living", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Green Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4501966/farm-sold-all-five-its-dairy-herd-because-plummetting-milk-prices-high-inflation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 53, "relevance": 1}

government of Ethiopia has paid due attention to the dairy sub-sector as the prime focus to improve the livelihoods and enhance production, according to Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nA stakeholders consultative workshop organized by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Ministry of Agriculture and Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) held today discussion on Ethiopia's dairy value chain improvement options.\n\nThe consultative workshop aims to make constructive consultations and generate practical and sustainable ideas to transform the country's dairy sub-sector in line with the country's initiatives.\n\nSpeaking at the workshop, State Minister of Agriculture, Fikru Regassa recalled that the Government launched a participatory, inclusive, and holistic livestock development programe dubbed 'Ye Lemat Tirufat' (Bounty of the Basket) in November 2022.\n\nThe programme aims to enhance public health and nutrition by improving the local production of poultry and dairy farming, apiculture, and the rearing of small ruminants.\n\nSo far, the programme has created interest and motivation for farmers and pastoralist communities across the country, he added.\n\nFor instance, he mentioned under the programme the government is determined to quadruple milk production from the current 7.1 billion litres to 28.4 billion litres by 2031.\n\nThus, he underlined the dairy sub-sector is given prime focus by this national programme.\n\nTo realize this, \"We need a strong partnership between the private and public institutions and besides, we need the efforts of local, regional, and international development partners, NGOs, financial, academic and research organizations.\"\n\nMoreover, Fikru added that it's important to discuss on the bottlenecks that hinder the development of the dairy value chain from different angles.\n\nFAO Representative in Ethiopia, Farayi Zimudzi said FAO has been an active development partner to the government of Ethiopia, in implementing a wide range of programs in projects to improve agriculture, food security, and nutrition of the population in the country.\n\nShe elaborated that livestock and particularly dairy, is one of the fastest growing sectors in Ethiopia, and is also a major component of FAO's programme in the country.\n\nShe reiterated that unwavering commitment of FAO to contributing to the country's efforts to transform its livestock industry, particularly the dairy sub-sector.\n\n\"Our engagements will contribute to the understanding of current efforts and identify options to build on existing dairy development initiatives by government and development partners to meet the country's demand for quality and safe milk and its products,\" according to Zimudze.\n\nKOICA Country Director, Cho Han Deog said on his part said Ethiopia is a country with high potential for dairy farming and dairy industry.\n\nHence, Korea has been supporting artificial insemination of cattle to produce superior breeds, provision of dairy cows to promote dairy farming and improve farmers' incomes, training to improve milk productivity, he elaborated.\n\n\"It would be great if we could identify some of the critical bottlenecks in putting 'made-in-Ethiopia' dairy products on the fresh food sections of stores and come up with the ideas of engaging in realizing the dairy development potential of Ethiopia based on the division of labor.\"\n\nThis is because there are so many people out there who depend on dairy value chain for their livelihood and Ethiopia's endeavor and path to develop manufacturing capacity, the dairy industry would be a good starting point.\n\nHe underlined collectively, it important to work together to advance dairy industry and produce meaningful achievements in Ethiopia.",

But driven by a desire to provide for her family, she persevered. Her farm quickly expanded from a single cow to a bustling enterprise.\n\n\"There was a time when we were unable to pay the school fees of our children. I felt hopeless and disappointed,\" Jan recalled. \"Now we earn lakhs monthly.\"\n\nFrom struggling to meet basic needs, Masrat Jan has emerged as a role model for aspiring women entrepreneurs in the Kashmir Valley. Her remarkable journey showcases how determined entrepreneurship can pave the way for financial empowerment and success.\n\nThe investment Masrat Jan made into starting her dairy farm proved to be life-changing in ways she could have never imagined. Despite facing hardships, her enthusiasm and hard work kept driving her forward. Jan takes immense pride in being a dairy entrepreneur. \"We have collaborated with locals to sell this milk and contribute towards alleviating the scarcity of milk in our area,\" she expressed.\n\nMasrat Jan expressed gratitude towards the government for supporting her venture and providing financial assistance for starting the dairy farm. Additionally, they aided her with a subsidized vehicle for transporting food, fodder, and supplying milk to shops.\n\nThe Integrated Dairy Development Scheme (IDDS), an initiative aimed at uplifting people in Jammu and Kashmir to take up dairy farming to extract its full benefits, played a key role. Under this scheme, both men and women can avail subsidies for dairy units. A male beneficiary can receive Rs 1.75 lakh, while a woman or a member of a scheduled caste/scheduled tribe can get Rs 2 lakh for setting up a unit.\n\nIn the initial days, Masrat realized the farm would be a game-changer due to the substantial monthly earnings. This convinced her husband to reinvest in higher-yielding cattle, marking the beginning of her successful dairy farm venture.\n\nMasrat Jan is satisfied with taking up her dairy farming venture. Apart from the income from selling milk, the manure her farm produces doubles her monthly earnings. With high hopes, the woman entrepreneur now plans to establish a vermicompost unit for cow dung to produce and supply organic manure, benefiting the local community and aiding agricultural production.\n\n\"When I bought the first cow, I realized this could overcome our financial insecurities, so I further expanded the venture. Slowly and steadily, the number increased,\" said Masrat. Dairy farming has transformed their lives economically due to the collaborative effort of Masrat and her husband, Shabir Ahmad Khanday. \"The schemes and subsidies encouraged us and kept us hooked towards the farm. Every cow in our farm is like family,\" said Khanday, appreciating the government's initiatives for rural upliftment.\n\nIn 2018, with immense support from her husband, Masrat took this initiative and emerged as one of Kashmir's successful dairy entrepreneurs, inspiring several other women. Her dairy farm significantly improved her family's financial condition.\n\n\"Support from family is crucial when managing and maintaining the animals' feeding,\" Jan said, acknowledging her husband's support.\n\nInitially, Masrat had no inclinations about establishing a dairy farming business and excelling in this field. \"Sometimes difficulties make a person opt for the right choices,\" she recalled her difficult days. Notably, her farm has become a source of employment, with two employees earning a monthly salary of Rs 10,000. Their dairy farm yields good liters of milk daily, bringing in approximately 1.5 to 2 lakh Rs monthly.\n\nMasrat considers dairy farming a promising solution to growing unemployment. \"It is crucial to be financially independent. Women should come out and take such initiatives; they can go into any field and start any business. They just need to be focused, consistent, and committed,\" she says.\n\nStarting from humble beginnings, Masrat now has 21 animals, including calves, in her farm. The dairy farming venture enables her to maintain her livelihood satisfactorily. She credits the Department of Animal Husbandry in Anantnag for her successful venture, educating her about schemes and subsidies, and providing various assistance.\n\nThe dairy sector is thriving in Anantnag District, with around 7.29 lakh liters of milk produced per day, said Dr. Javeed Mohiuddin Zargar, Chief Animal Husbandry Officer, Anantnag. \"The IDDS has been beneficial to farmers; they are provided unit-wise subsidies in which both men and women can avail of its benefits,\" he said, adding that 153 dairy units were established during 2023-24, and 103 more have been approved for 2024-25.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anantnag_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anantnag district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anantnag district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermicompost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermicompost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_dung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cow dung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organic farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fodder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal husbandry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www-greaterkashmir-com.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-1146.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9583072", "eventUri": "eng-9583072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 46, "relevance": 1}

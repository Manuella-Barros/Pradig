The decision to introduce the new route was made during discussions between the management of Uzbekistan Airports and representatives of Loong Air. Alongside the announcement of the new route, both parties explored opportunities to expand cargo transportation, highlighting the growing economic cooperation between China and Uzbekistan. Loong Air, headquartered in Hangzhou, specializes in providing both passenger and cargo services. Currently, the airline operates regular passenger flights on the Chengdu-Tashkent and Xi An-Tashkent routes, with three flights per week on each route. The addition of the Xi An-Samarkand route is expected to further strengthen the air network between the two countries. Earlier Daryo reported that YTO Cargo Airlines, based in China, was set to commence regular cargo flights to Uzbekistan starting from June 6. The inaugural flight to Tashkent International Airport will utilize the ARJ21-700 aircraft manufactured by China's Comac. Prior to this, YTO Cargo Airlines had conducted charter flights to Tashkent using Boeing 757 aircraft.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZGFyeW8udXovZW4vMjAyNC8wNi8wNy9jaGluZXNlLWxvb25nLWFpci10by1sYXVuY2gtbmV3LWZsaWdodC1yb3V0ZS10by11emJla2lzdGFu0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Loong Air to launch new flight route to Uzbekistan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">DARYO.UZ - CENTRAL ASIA & AFGHANISTAN NEWS</font>", "url": "https://daryo.uz/en/2024/06/07/chinese-loong-air-to-launch-new-flight-route-to-uzbekistan", "image": "https://daryo.uz/static/2024/06/medium-666335a2da18f.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:18:57", "author": "Daryo.uz", "authors": ["Daryo.uz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "uz", "sentiment": -0.08}

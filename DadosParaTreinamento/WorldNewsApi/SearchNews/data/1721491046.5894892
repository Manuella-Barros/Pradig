Several of Apple's iOS 18 software features will make the iPhone 14 and later models less reliant on WiFi and cellular connectivity \u2014 and could even make the company less reliant on iPhone sales. The company is expanding an emergency-messaging feature, introduced with the iPhone 14, that enables devices to contact first responders via satellite. While the service was launched as free, Apple indicated at the time that it would likely charge for the emergency feature, then extended the free period for another year. But then, at last week's WWDC, the company unveiled a nonemergency version of the service it's calling \"messages via satellite.\" \"Now you can use the satellite capabilities on iPhone 14 and later to connect to satellites hundreds of miles above the Earth to text your friends and family when you're off the grid,\" Ronak Shah, Apple's head of internet-technologies product marketing, said. The functionality will support sending and receiving messages, emojis, and tapbacks, all with end-to-end encryption, as well as SMS messaging.

Elohor Aiboni, and the Managing Director of Chevron Nigeria Ltd., Jim Swartz, stated that their companies' divestment from onshore and shallow water assets was a general realignment of their portfolios across the globe and should not be misconstrued as an exit from Nigeria.Speaking further on his company's commitment to remain in Nigeria, Swartz said: We are excited about what the government is doing to build confidence in investors. We are excited to work with NNPC Ltd.\"", "source": {"uri": "newmail-ng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Mail Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adebari_oguntoye@newmail-ng.com", "name": "Adebari Oguntoye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPC_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NNPC Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_Technology_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offshore Technology Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstream (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://newmail-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Oritsemeyiwa-Eyesan-e1715198141939.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552627", "eventUri": "eng-9552627", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.968627450980392, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

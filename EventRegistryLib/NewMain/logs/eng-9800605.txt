NASA officials announced on Wednesday that astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore aboard the International Space Station (ISS) might return to Earth in February 2025.\n\nThe officials stated that the two astronauts might return to earth on SpaceX's Crew Dragon instead of Boeing's Starliner, according to media reports.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore took off aboard the Boeing Starliner in June. They had reached the ISS on June 6. The Starliner has faced glitches in the propulsion system after a series of helium leaks, as per an NDTV report. Boeing and NASA have been scrambling to fix the issues.\n\nAs per the NDTV report, the International space agency said that Williams investigated using fluid physics, such as surface tension, to overcome the lack of gravity when watering and nourishing plants being grown in space.\n\nDuring a media interaction on Wednesday, a NASA official said that the space agency said that it has \"placed all the options on the table\" while planning the return of its Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from space.\n\nThe official said it has weighed in on many options. One of those would ensure the return of the two astronauts to Earth in 2025. And this plan involves Boeing's rival SpaceX. Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, said NASA's prime option is to return Butch and Sunita on Starliner. \"However, we have done requisite planning to make sure we have other options open,\" he said, as quoted by Livemint.\n\nStich said NASA has been working with SpaceX. \"We have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they are ready to respond on Crew 9... returning Butch and Suni on Crew 9 if we need that.\"\n\nIn June, NASA denied that astronauts Williams and Wilmore were stranded. The US space agency and Boeing officials had stated they are currently \"not in any rush to come home.\" The reaction had come amid multiple reports claiming that the two astronauts, sent to the orbiting laboratory onboard Boeing Starliner spacecraft, are stranded after suspected helium leaks.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials said they are using \"the luxury of time\" to learn more before the astronauts return to Earth.\n\n\"I want to make it real clear that we're not in any rush to come home,\" Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew programme manager, was quoted as saying during a press conference late on Friday (US time), as quoted by news agency IANS. \"The station is a nice, safe place to stop and take our time to work through the vehicle and make sure we're ready to come home,' he added.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/08/55160d80eedb6668a09b81207d567f931723106495589566_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-06", "textStart": 758, "textEnd": 764}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Recent results have unearthed new information, causing greater alarm about a safe return.\n\nThe latest test data have stirred disagreements and debate within NASA about whether to accept the risk of a Starliner return to Earth, or make the call to use Crew Dragon instead.\n\nUsing a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon.\n\nStarliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum 90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming astronaut crew.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, NASA, using a SpaceX rocket and a Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered a routine shipment of food and supplies to the station, including extra clothes for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nStarliner's high-stakes mission is a final test required before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights to and from the ISS. Crew Dragon received NASA approval for astronaut flights in 2020.\n\nStarliner development has been set back by management issues and numerous engineering problems. It has cost Boeing $1.6 billion since 2016, including $125 million from Starliner's current test mission, securities filings show.\n\nCONCERNS AT NASA\n\nA meeting this week of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing with a plan to accept Boeing's testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home, officials said during a news conference.\n\n\"We didn't poll in a way that led to a conclusion,\" Commercial Crew Program chief Steve Stich said.\n\n\"We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear,\" Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations chief, added.\n\nA Boeing executive was not at the Wednesday press conference.\n\nWhile no decision has been made on using Starliner or Crew Dragon, NASA has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner. Sometime next week is when NASA expects to decide, officials said.\n\nThe agency on Tuesday delayed by more than a month SpaceX's upcoming Crew Dragon mission, a routine flight called Crew-9, that is expected to send three NASA astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS.\n\nNASA's ISS program chief said the agency has not yet decided which astronauts they would pull off the mission for Wilmore and Williams if needed.\n\nBoeing's testing so far has shown that four of Starliner's jets had failed in June because they overheated and automatically turned off, while other thrusters re-fired during tests appeared weaker than normal because of some restriction to their propellant.\n\nGround tests in late July at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have helped reveal that the thrusters' overheating causes a teflon seal to warp, choking propellant tubes for the thrusters and thereby weakening their thrust.\n\n\"That, I would say, upped the level of discomfort, and not having a total understanding of the physics of what's happening,\" Stich said, describing why NASA now appears more willing to discuss a Crew Dragon contingency after previously downplaying such a prospect to reporters.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type":

NASA and Boeing have been evaluating whether Starliner is safe enough for the astronauts' return to Earth. While Boeing supports the craft's safety, NASA has been developing contingency plans involving SpaceX.\n\nRecently, the possibility of NASA relying on Elon Musk's company to conclude Boeing's mission has increased. NASA is considering launching a SpaceX crew vehicle to the ISS in September with two open seats, which could be used by Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the astronauts Boeing sent to the ISS about two months ago. If this plan goes ahead, they will stay on the ISS until early next year when SpaceX's vehicle departs.\n\nKen Bowersox, a senior NASA official and former astronaut, stated that there is no requirement for the crew to return on Starliner. Concerns about Starliner's readiness arose from recent test results, and NASA is expected to decide on the next steps by mid-August, with no final decision yet on whether to use Boeing or SpaceX.\n\nBoeing maintains confidence in Starliner, stating it will make necessary adjustments if NASA opts for an uncrewed return. Wilmore and Williams have been on the space station since June 6, with their stay extended due to technical issues with Starliner, including thruster failures and helium leaks.\n\nTensions between Boeing and NASA surfaced when they disagreed on Starliner's usage, leading to a postponed review of its readiness. Steve Stich, a NASA manager, highlighted differing views on the risks and uncertainties associated with Starliner.\n\nIn the meantime, NASA delayed a planned SpaceX launch from mid-August to September 24 to allow more time to finalize the astronauts' return plans. If NASA opts for SpaceX, Wilmore and Williams would remain on the ISS until February 2025, when SpaceX's vehicle is set to return.\n\nStarliner's inaugural crewed flight has faced significant scrutiny, as NASA aims to have both Boeing and SpaceX vehicles available to ensure continuous access to the ISS. While Boeing believes Starliner is ready, recent challenges have underscored the difficulties the company has faced in developing the spacecraft, especially compared to SpaceX, which completed its first crewed ISS mission over four years ago. Wilmore and Williams have continued their work aboard the ISS, participating in scientific research and equipment maintenance during their extended stay.\n\nNASA and Boeing are still working towards resolving the spacecraft's technical issues, and the final decision on whether Starliner will bring the astronauts home is yet to be made.\n\nWhy are they stuck?\n\nIt seems that there was an issue retrieving real-time information. However, based on the details we have:\n\nSunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are experiencing an extended stay aboard the ISS due to unresolved technical problems with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The issues include the failure of several thrusters and leaks in the helium system, which are critical for the spacecraft's propulsion and safe re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. These malfunctions have raised safety concerns, prompting NASA and Boeing to reassess the spacecraft's readiness for the return journey.\n\nWho is Sunita Williams?\n\nSunita Williams, an Indian-American astronaut and United States Navy officer, is a trailblazer in space exploration with a career marked by extraordinary achievements. Born on September 19, 1965, in Euclid, Ohio, to an Indian father and Slovak-American mother, she grew up in Massachusetts, where her early interest in science and exploration led her to the United States Naval Academy. Graduating in 1987, she embarked on a successful naval career, serving as a helicopter pilot and participating in key operations like the Persian Gulf War.\n\nHer passion for aviation and engineering earned her a Master's degree and, in 1998, selection as a NASA astronaut candidate. Williams' space career is highlighted by her first mission aboard Space Shuttle Discovery in 2006, during which she set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman at 195 days. Known for her pioneering spirit, she completed seven spacewalks, totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes -- the most by any female astronaut -- and became the first person to run a marathon in space, participating in the Boston Marathon from the International Space Station (ISS).

"body": "Two NASA astronauts stuck on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than two months could be forced to stay until February 2025 because of concerns over the safety of the spacecraft that brought them into orbit.\n\nCommander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita \"Suni\" Williams arrived at the ISS in June as the first crew to test Boeing's new Starliner.\n\nThe US pair were expected to be back on Earth by now, but have been grounded by issues with the capsule, which suffered thruster failures before it docked - causing their mission to be extended indefinitely.\n\nThey may have to stay until February if NASA decides to bring them back on a SpaceX flight, rather than risk using the Starliner capsule.\n\nThat would mean they would watch from the space station as the Starliner is cut loose from the ISS to return to Earth without them.\n\nKen Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief, said the US space agency is looking more closely at SpaceX as a back-up, and \"could take either path\".\n\nMr Bowersox said during a recent meeting, they \"heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear\".\n\nA final decision is expected by mid-August.\n\nIt could have a knock-on effect on NASA's next SpaceX taxi flight in September, when two of the astronauts scheduled to fly may be left at home, so there is space for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams on the return trip in February.\n\nThree NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, but it's not known who could miss out.\n\nBoeing has reiterated its capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home, but the company will need to modify Starliner's software in case it has to return without a crew.\n\nNASA's commercial crew manager Steve Stich said they hadn't seriously thought about launching a separate SpaceX flight just to bring back Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams.\n\nHe said thruster problems have also happened during ground tests and engineers don't know why seals that swell when overheated then shrink back to their proper size.\n\nAll but one of the Starliner's five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.\n\nStarliner needs them to back away from the space station following undocking and to keep the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit.\n\nTechnicians are also trying to plug helium leaks in Starliner's propulsion system, which is crucial for manoeuvring.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow stranded are the NASA astronauts?\n\nFuture astronauts could stay in 'moon cave'\n\nWhat to look out for in the night sky this

Ongoing issues with Starliner's propulsion system have raised concerns about the spacecraft's ability to safely return to Earth, prompting NASA to consider alternative plans, including a potential rescue mission using SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nWhen Wilmore and Williams launched on June 5, they anticipated a brief mission to test Boeing's Starliner capsule. However, issues with the spacecraft emerged shortly after docking with the ISS. Problems included thruster malfunctions and helium leaks, which have rendered the Starliner unsafe for their return. Initially planned as an eight-day mission, the astronauts now face the prospect of spending up to eight months in space.\n\nRead More: NASA's Perseverance rover discovers potential signs of ancient life on Mars\n\nNASA officials have been rigorously analyzing the issues plaguing Starliner. Despite Boeing's insistence that the spacecraft can safely bring the astronauts home, NASA remains divided over the risk. During a recent press conference, Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, emphasized the need for thorough planning to ensure the astronauts' safe return, stating that all options, including an uncrewed return of Starliner, are on the table.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding Starliner, NASA is exploring the possibility of using SpaceX's Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams back. The upcoming Crew Dragon mission, Crew-9, scheduled for late September, could be modified to leave two seats vacant for the astronauts' return trip in February 2025. This plan, if executed, would involve Wilmore and Williams staying on the ISS for several more months.\n\nBoeing's Starliner program has faced significant setbacks since its inception. The recent propulsion system failures have added to the company's woes, with issues such as overheating thrusters and helium leaks complicating the mission. These technical difficulties have fueled internal disagreements within NASA about the best course of action. While some officials advocate for relying on Boeing's testing data, others remain skeptical of the spacecraft's safety.\n\nThe potential use of SpaceX's Crew Dragon to rescue the astronauts would be a significant blow to Boeing. The aerospace giant has been striving to compete with SpaceX, but the ongoing issues with Starliner could undermine its reputation and future contracts with NASA. Boeing has already reported substantial financial losses on the Starliner program, and the current situation could further impact its standing in the aerospace industry.\n\nRead More: NASA's Curiosity rover discovers pure sulfur crystals on Mars\n\nNASA's decision to contract both Boeing and SpaceX for astronaut transport aimed to ensure redundancy and reliability. However, the current predicament highlights the importance of having multiple operational spacecraft.

At this point, \"we could take either path,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.\n\nThe disagreements over Wilmore and Williams' return to earth prompted officials to postpone an in-depth readiness review of the Starliner and to delay a SpaceX launch that was planned for Tuesday.\n\nThe Independent has contacted NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX for comment.\n\nPublically, Boeing has insisted it still stands behind the Starliner, which suffered mechanical issues on its way to docking at the ISS on June 6 for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission.\n\n\"Boeing remains

We could bring them back on another vehicle,\" Bowersox added. The space agency is expected to make a final decision as early as next week.\n\n\"Our prime option is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program said. \"However, we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open, and so we have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they're ready to respond.\"\n\nNASA said it is now considering sending only two astronauts, instead of four, on September's SpaceX Crew-9 mission to leave space for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on SpaceX Dragon in February 2025.

Image courtesy: @Space_Station/X\n\nThey went to space for eight days. Now more than 60 days later, Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams and her counterpart Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore are still stranded there. When will they return? There are no clear answers but it may not be until 2025.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore took off on a test mission on Boeing Starliner to the International Space Station (ISS) on June 5 and were expected to return in eight days. However, the plans went awry. Now more than two months on, they are still floating above the Earth.\n\nWe take a look at why the return continues to be delayed and what can we expect next.\n\nSunita Williams, 58, and Barry Wilmore, 61, flew in the Boeing Starliner spacecraft to the ISS. It was the first of its kind flight with people on board.\n\nThe mission was a test to evaluate the performance of the new spacecraft before it is used regularly. The Starliner was scheduled to begin its return journey on June 26.\n\nHowever, several issues were detected in some of the key mechanisms of the spacecraft even before it docked at the ISS. There were leaks in the propulsion system and some of its thrusters started shutting down. However, despite the glitches the Starlier reached the ISS safely.\n\nAt first, the issues seemed small. However, since the takeoff, the capsule has had five helium leaks. Helium pressurises the rockets, helps maintain their structural integrity, and helps manoeuvre the spacecraft.\n\nThat is not the only issue. Five of the 28 manoeuvring thrusters have gone dead and a propellant valve failed to close completely, according to a report in Reuters.\n\nThe crew in space and mission managers in Houston have been pursuing the fixes. Boeing claims to have fixed most of the issues through a series of simulations - around 1,00,000 - with 27 thrusters now reportedly working at full capacity. However, NASA has requested more data from Boeing, as there is doubt that the Starliner might be unsafe to fly back to Earth.\n\nWhat if Starliner is not fit for return?\n\nBoeing and Nasa have been scrambling to fix the problems with the spacecraft.\n\nNow Nasa is examining whether the two astronauts could return in another vehicle - SpaceX's Crew Dragon. It said on Wednesday that the astronauts could fly back on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe.\n\nThe mission undertaken by Elon Musk's SpaceX is scheduled to launch in September and return to Earth next year. At first four crew members were to be aboard. But now two seats could be kept empty to bring back Williams and Wilmore.\n\nThe SpaceX vehicle is a Commercial Crew Program (CCP) spacecraft. The Crew-9 mission with the Dragon capsule was initially set for August 18 but has been postponed to no earlier than September 24.\n\nThis would mean that the astronauts would spend more than eight months in space. However, Nasa officials said that no firm decisions have been taken about the next step. A final decision could take a week or more, according to a report in the BBC.\n\nIt is not the only way out. Multiple plans exist to get the astronauts back to Earth, including having them even hitch a ride on a Russian Soyuz craft, reports USA TODAY.\n\nWhat does this mean for the astronauts?\n\nThe astronauts have been stuck at the ISS for over 60 days. Recently, NASA used a SpaceX rocket to deliver more food and supplies, including extra clothes.\n\nAt a recent briefing call, Williams told reporters, \"We've been thoroughly busy up here, integrated right into the crew... It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team.\"\n\nWork and gardening have been keeping them busy. Williams and Wilmore are performing experiments in the Harmony module, which acts as a connecting passageway between international space labs and spacecraft.\n\nHowever, the time in space is affecting their health, which is concerning. Williams is suffering from bone density loss due to prolonged exposure to microgravity. This can lead to other health complications such as visual impairment and the risk of DNA damage, according to a report in The Indian Express.\n\nBringing the two astronauts back is the top priority. \"We know at some point we need to bring Butch and Suni home,\" said Ken Bowersox, Nasa's associate administrator for space operations.\n\nWhat happens to the Starliner then?\n\nIf Crew Dragon or any other spacecraft is used to bring back the two astronauts, Starliner would be brought back under computer control.\n\nAccording to Bowersox, the chances of an uncrewed return of the Starliner \"have increased a little bit based on where things have gone over the last week or two\". \"That's why we're looking more closely at that option to make sure that we can handle it,\" he told reporters, according to the BBC.\n\nWhatever it is, this is bad news for Boeing, which has been trying to compete with Space X. However, business might have to take a backseat until the astronauts are back on Earth.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

This decision was made to allow for further analysis of concerns related to Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which is currently docked at the ISS. The Crew Dragon spacecraft, operated by SpaceX, was originally set to launch four astronauts on August 18; however, NASA has now rescheduled this mission, designated Crew-9, to take place \"no earlier than\" September 24.\n\nAlso Read: These smartphones from Google, Samsung and Oppo won't get Android 15 update\n\nThe agency stated that this modification provides additional time for mission managers to complete the return planning for the Boeing Crew Flight Test, which is currently docked at the orbiting laboratory.\n\nIn June, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft successfully transported its inaugural two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a critical test mission mandated by NASA prior to granting certification for regular astronaut flights. This significant achievement mirrors the milestone reached by SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule in 2020.\n\nThe test mission of Starliner, which was originally anticipated to span approximately eight days, has been significantly prolonged due to a series of issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system that Boeing and NASA are urgently working to resolve.\n\nThese complications have raised concerns regarding Starliner's capability to safely transport its crew, experienced NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, back to Earth.

As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.\n\nIf that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as the Starliner's first crew.\n\nNASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by the Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup.\n\nAt this point, \"we could take either path,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.\n\nDuring a recent meeting, Bowersox said NASA has \"heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear.\" A final decision is expected by mid-August.\n\nBoeing issued a brief statement following NASA's news update, repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"We still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rationale.\" the company said.\n\nBoeing will need to modify the capsule's software in case the Starliner ends up returning without a crew.\n\nNo serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.\n\nTests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to seals as one culprit. But it's still not understood how or why those seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size, Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner's five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.\n\nThese thrusters are essential for allowing the Starliner to back away from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit.\n\nAt the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system, which is crucial for maneuvering. The first leak occurred before liftoff, but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more cropped up in flight.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.\n\nOfficials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on Wednesday. Bowersox said a situation like this one could happen again, which is why NASA wants multiple vehicles.\n\nThe next crew flight will be SpaceX's 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to figure out how best to handle the Starliner's return. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday declined to say who might be bumped.\n\nIn this image from video provided by NASA, astronauts Suni Williams, left, and Butch Wilmore give a news conference aboard the International Space Station on Wednesday, July 10, 2024.

The mission was only expected to last for eight days, but due to problems with Starliner, the two remain stranded on the space station two months later.\n\nThe initial launch went to plan, but while in space and not yet docked to the ISS, the crew encountered problems.\n\n\"We lost an RCS jet, then we lost another one,\" Wilmore explained in July. \"And then you could tell the thrust, the control, the capability was degraded. The handling qualities were not the same.\"\n\n\"From that point on you could tell that the thrust was degraded,\" Wilmore added. \"At the time we didn't know why.\"\n\nStarliner performed well during precise docking with the ISS, and the astronauts got into their new living quarters. They have remained there while the crew and NASA attempted to fix the problems - including a helium leak - which prevented them from returning on board Starliner in June.\n\nMonths later, NASA is considering sending Starliner home without a crew and collecting the two astronauts with another spacecraft.\n\n\"As we've said before, our prime option is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,\" Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager said in an update on Wednesday. \"However we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open.\"\n\n\"We have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they're ready to respond,\" he added, \"for a contingency of returning Butch and Suni on Crew 9 if we need that.\"\n\nThat contingency plan would involve sending the Dragon for the next crew run, but with two empty seats for Williams and Wilmore to return in. Stich added that NASA has prepared this contingency plan, including identifying suits ready for the astronauts' return.\n\nWhile it's good news that NASA has a backup plan for getting the astronauts home, it's not ideal. The next mission to the ISS is scheduled to launch in September and return to Earth in February 2025. That's a very long eight-day trip, and would see the astronauts have an unplanned summer, autumn, and winter aboard the space station.\n\nNASA continues to work on the preferred option of returning the two on Starliner.\n\n\"But I would say that our chances of an uncrewed Starliner return have increased a little bit based on where things have gone over the last week or two,\" Ken Bowersox, NASA's director of space operations, added. \"That's why we're looking more closely at that option to make sure that we can handle it.\"\n\nOne problem they face is that Starliner was not designed to perform undocking procedures without a crew, according to sources speaking to Ars Technica. A significant software update is required in order to do so, contributing to the delay. Previous tests of a different Starliner vehicle, however, showed that the craft was capable of an uncrewed docking and undocking, raising questions as to why this version of Starliner did not have that capability.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/75469/aImg/78085/iss-meta.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-05", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 201}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

This development follows ongoing safety evaluations of the Starliner spacecraft, which has encountered several technical issues.\n\nThe two astronauts were launched to the ISS in June aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule, marking the spacecraft's first crewed mission. The mission was initially scheduled for a 10-day duration, but the astronauts have since remained aboard the ISS. The decision on their return vehicle is still pending and will depend heavily on the outcome of the Starliner's safety assessments.\n\nNASA is currently exploring multiple options for the safe return of the astronauts. Among these, the Crew Dragon, developed by SpaceX, is being considered as a viable alternative. If Boeing's Starliner is deemed unsafe to re-enter Earth's atmosphere by February 2025, the Crew Dragon capsule would be tasked with bringing Williams and Wilmore back to Earth. The delay in using Starliner has been attributed to technical problems that have raised concerns about its readiness for safe human transport. These issues have prompted NASA to reassess the return strategy to ensure the safety of the astronauts.\n\nAs the situation develops, NASA remains committed to ensuring that the return journey of the ISS crew is conducted with the utmost safety, with all possible contingencies being thoroughly evaluated. The next SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, Crew-9, is set to launch no earlier than August 18. This mission, which will carry four astronauts for a six-month stay at the space station, will be the ninth such mission for SpaceX. Following Crew-9's arrival, another Crew Dragon currently docked at the ISS will return four of the station's current occupants to Earth, completing their six-month mission.\n\nIt should be noted here that NASA is coordinating closely with SpaceX to ensure that the design fixes for the rocket will ensure the safety of astronauts on future Crew Dragon missions.

Credit: NASA\n\nA pair of U.S. astronauts who test-piloted a new Boeing spaceship in June may not fly home on the craft they rode in on.\n\nWhile Boeing has conducted a variety of tests in space and on the ground to try to better understand problems with its Starliner capsule, now docked at the International Space Station, NASA apparently has been busy making contingency plans for an alternative way to bring Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, back to Earth.\n\nNASA officials said they would decide whether the two would return on Starliner or Boeing's competitor, SpaceX's Dragon capsule, by mid-August. That possible shift in plans, announced during a call with reporters on Wednesday, comes after two months of the agency insisting it wasn't entertaining the idea of changing horses -- or, rather, spacecraft -- in midstream.\n\nIf NASA chooses to use SpaceX for Wilmore and Williams' return voyage, they would remain at the space station for at least another six or seven months. That would extend their originally planned eight-day visit to a nine-month layover and would have a cascading effect on the crew lineups for future expeditions.\n\n\"I want to reiterate we haven't made a decision yet,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nClues that NASA was making changes emerged one day earlier when the space agency announced through a blog post that it would be postponing its next crew launch to the space station for more \"flexibility\" in the schedule. That SpaceX flight, originally slated to bring four people to the station this month, will now launch no earlier than Sept. 24.\n\nIf NASA chooses to send Starliner's test pilots back with SpaceX, the decision would reduce the upcoming September launch to carrying just two passengers instead of four. It would also cut short Boeing's first human spaceflight test for Starliner, making the path forward for the spacecraft to become operational unclear.\n\nWilmore and Williams reached the space station on June 6, despite encountering problems with Starliner's propulsion system right before docking. The issues involved helium leaks and weak thrust, apparently the result of five of the 28 thrusters malfunctioning. The thrusters are necessary for controlling and handling the ship in space.\n\nThe team has since reactivated all but one of the faulty thrusters. Boeing has continued to run tests to try to diagnose the problems and says Starliner has more than enough helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters, to get back home.\n\nBut one of the thruster tests conducted on a replica back on Earth revealed an issue with a Teflon seal, about the size of a pinky finger, that may be swelling and shrinking, causing a blockage in the flow of propellant.\n\n\"If we could replicate the physics in some offline testing to understand why this (seal) is heating up and extruding, and then why it's contracting, that would give us additional confidence to move forward,\" Stich said.\n\nNASA did not include representatives of SpaceX or Boeing on the media call Wednesday. In its own blog post, Boeing has said it is confident that Starliner can bring the astronauts home safely.\n\nNASA hired both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft to ferry astronauts back and forth to the space station a decade ago. After the agency retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, it had to pay Russia millions of dollars to get seats for U.S. astronauts on Soyuz rockets. The goal was to establish a commercial space taxi industry in the United States so that wasn't necessary.\n\nThough SpaceX has built and run its Dragon spaceship since 2020, Boeing's Starliner has yet to pass the testing phase.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vostok 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05KuXbdZhiRofsQ2g92Bx4I/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1723062686.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 1758, "textEnd": 1766}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-06", "textStart": 2142, "textEnd": 2148}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.\n\nIf that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliner's first crew.\n\nNASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup,\n\nAt this point, \"we could take either path,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations mission chief.\n\nDuring a recent meeting, \"We heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear,\" he said. A final decision is expected by mid-August.\n\nBoeing issued a brief statement following NASA's news update, repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"We still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rationale.\" the company said.\n\nBoeing will need to modify the capsule's software in case Starliner ends up returning without a crew.\n\nNo serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.\n\nTests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to seals as one culprit. But it's still not understood how or why those seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size, Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner's five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit.\n\nThese thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit.\n\nAt the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in Starliner's propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak occurred before liftoff, but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more cropped up in flight.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.\n\nOfficials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on Wednesday, A situation like this one could happen again, and \"that's why we want multiple vehicles,\" Bowersox said.\n\nThe next crew flight will be SpaceX's 10th for NASA.

Engineers at Boeing and NASA are conflicted over Starliner's reliability. NASA confirms Crew Dragon contingency plans, but Starliner is still the primary option.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS), could be there until next year, according to the latest update from NASA. Despite spending several weeks expressing confidence in overcoming Starliner's technical problems, some NASA officials appear to be growing increasingly skeptical of the spacecraft's capability to bring the two home.\n\nNASA says astronauts could remain until next year\n\nDuring a media teleconference on Wednesday, key figures at NASA delivered an update on the Starliner situation. It has yet to make a decision on whether Wilmore and Williams will return on Starliner or not - Ken Bowersox, NASA's Associate Administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, said the agency \"could take either path... depending on our position of uncertainty with the data we've got on the thruster system.\"\n\nPhoto: Nauman Shafqat | Shutterstock\n\nThe agency confirmed it is working with SpaceX on a contingency plan to bring the two astronauts home on a Crew Dragon, but that its primary option remains Starliner. If the two do hitch a ride on Crew Dragon, they would likely remain on the ISS until February 2025. NASA also confirmed plans to push SpaceX's Crew-9 mission back from August 18th to no earlier than September 24th - additionally, the mission could go ahead with just two astronauts, rather than the initial four, to make space for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nWhile Boeing is confident about Starliner's safety, engineers at NASA are less optimistic. Bowersox praised the constructive discussions between engineers from both sides, noting that different voices were comfortable speaking up with their perspectives. He added that the agency is \"not too far away from making a call\" on which vehicle to bring the two astronauts home in.\n\nThruster testing updates\n\nSteve Stitch, Manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, provided more details on the thruster testing as engineers seek to understand the root cause of Starliner's problems. During its journey to the ISS, five of Starliner's 28 thrusters were shut down due to overheating, with four of the five eventually recovering.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nThe current understanding is that bulging Teflon seals are leading to both propellant vaporization and blockages. Stich said,\n\n\"The interesting thing when we hot fired the thrusters is that all the thrusters across the whole vehicle are essentially at nominal thrust level.\"\n\nBoeing has declared its confidence in Starliner and pointed to an \"abundance\" of testing data supporting the spacecraft's safety. As Simple Flying reported earlier this week, Starliner no longer has the capacity to autonomously undock itself, as it was instead programmed with a crewed configuration.

However, the astronauts are now stranded on the ISS due to Boeing's faulty Starliner - and have received the horrifying news that they might not come back to Earth until February 2025. NASA has revealed a contingency plan that could launch a SpaceX 's Crew-9 mission in September, but still wouldn't bring the crew home until months later. On social media, concerned fans have reacted with horror at the situation, calling the delay 'torture'.\n\nAnd for many, the thought of being trapped on the ISS is a terrifying idea, with one commenter simply writing: 'New nightmare unlocked'. Mr Wilmore, 61, and Ms Williams, 58, flew to the ISS at the beginning of June on board a Boeing Starliner spacecraft. However, problems including helium leaks and thruster failures began to emerge as the spacecraft approached the ISS. Thankfully, the pair managed to dock to the ISS safely, but the problems have scuppered their plans to return to Earth on board the same Boeing Starliner. Tuesday marked the pair's 60the day in space - instead of the intended eight-day mission.\n\nLast week, Boeing said that it 'remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.' It now seems more likely that the Williams and Wilmore will need to wait for the arrival of a SpaceX mission in September. That flight had been planned to take four astronauts to the ISS but two of the seats could be left empty if NASA decides that Starliner is not safe enough for a crewed return. On social media, concerned fans back on Earth have been horrified at Williams and Wilmore's predicament. One commenter wrote: 'Stuck in space for 60 days with no known solution is inhumane and torture.\n\n'Why did y'all teams send those astronauts in the first place? Where is the Change.Org petition to bring back the astronauts?' Another worried commenter wrote: 'Hope they come back alive and tell us about it. Nightmarish. Only happens in movies.' Another commenter likened the situation to that of the Ocean Gate submarine which collapsed while attempting to reach the Titanic . On X, formerly Twitter, the commenter wrote 'It's giving' before attaching a picture of the doomed submersible. While many on social media focussed on the terrifying aspects of the astronaut's ordeal, others pointed out the cinematic qualities of the situation.\n\n'Netflix movie inbound', one commenter wrote. Another added: 'I'd have busted out the window by now... There would be a Netflix special documenting my spiral into madness in Space. At least 6 parts.' Others compared the situation to the plot of Gilligan's Island, a 1960s sitcom in which a group of travelers are shipwrecked after embarking on a 3-hour tour. One commenter wrote: 'Hear me out... I got a really cool new space age twist on Gilligan's Island.' 'It's Gilligan's Island in space', another commenter simply added. As social media watched the drama unfold, many commenters' thoughts naturally turned to possible escape plans.\n\nA number of commenters fixated on the rivalry between Boeing and rival company SpaceX founded by Elon Musk. Both companies are part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) but while Boeing's Starliner has been mired in failures SpaceX capsules and rockets are used routinely. On X, which is also owned by Mr Musk, one commenter wrote: 'Space X needs to go rescue them.' Another added: 'Elon is going to have to get them isn't he...' 'How much is Elon going to charge for the uber lift home?', another asked jokingly. Meanwhile, one pessimistic commenter joked that it 'might be quicker if the Boeing astronauts just started walking home.'\n\nNASA has so far remained uncommitted on whether a SpaceX rescue mission will be necessary. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Steve Stich, manager of the NASA CCP, told reporters: 'Our prime option is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner. 'However, we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open.' However, experts told MailOnline in June that NASA could be forced to launch a rescue mission, suggesting Elon Musk's SpaceX would be tapped to get it done. Mike Gruntman, professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California, told MailOnline that 'it is more likely that SpaceX would be able to provide an additional launch in the foreseeable future to bring the astronauts back.'\n\nProfessor Gruntman continued: 'It is highly unfortunate that Boeing's Starliner, after so much delay with its flight, continues to face problems. 'For decades, Boeing was one of the most admired aerospace and defense companies. It is a true national tragedy.' Problems with Boeing's commercial jets, including turbulence, mechanical issues and tail strikes, have cost the company at least $3 billion. And NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to build Starliner as a taxi for astronauts to the ISS. A meeting this week of NASA's CCP, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing on a plan to accept Boeing's testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home.\n\n'We didn't poll in a way that led to a conclusion,' Mr Stich said. Ken Bowersox, NASA's space operations chief, added: 'We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear.' While no decision has been made on using Starliner or SpaceX's Crew Dragon, NASA has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner. Sometime next week is when NASA expects to decide, officials said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Relatively few missions sent to explore space over the years have been crewed, and for good reason. The risk to human (and animal) life is always high, even as technology in this field advances rapidly.\n\nIn one of the scariest disasters in recent years, two US astronauts who were meant to spend eight days traveling to and from the International Space Station (ISS) have been stuck there for over two months. What's more, they may not be able to get home until 2025. This is due to the myriad of technical issues that have left their craft, the new Boeing Starliner capsule, unsafe to use. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were the first crew to fly the ship on its maiden voyage -- an unlucky predicament, as it turns out. The mission launch occurred on June 5, and the Starliner made it to the ISS safely. However, several technical issues came to light that made it impossible for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on the scheduled date. What was supposed to be eight days stretched into eight weeks as Boeing and NASA attempted to resolve the issues. In July, Boeing revealed that four of Starliner's jet fuels had failed, the thrusters were malfunctioning, and there were helium leaks.\n\nThe Starliner, as well as the two astronauts, have now been at the ISS for over 60 days. The Starliner can only remain docked for a maximum of 90 days. NASA and Boeing now say that the Starliner may have to return to Earth uncrewed when the time is up if the faults haven't been repaired to everyone's satisfaction, meaning it wouldn't be safe to carry Wilmore and Williams. If this is the case, the pair will have to wait until the next spacecraft capable of carrying humans visits the ISS in 2025. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is scheduled to visit the space station and return to Earth in February next year. Boeing are determined to get Wilmore and Williams home before the 90 days is up, but sources say NASA officials are not sufficiently confident in their reports regarding the safety testing of the Starliner.\n\nWhile the world waits to see when and how these astronauts will make it back to Earth, let's look back at some of the worst disasters in the history of space travel to remember what is at stake.", "source": {"uri": "starsinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media-manager.starsinsider.com/1280/na_66b4d087a6a5f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-05", "textStart": 815, "textEnd": 821}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

If that happens, the astronauts would be stuck until February 2025.\n\n\"We have this contingency plan we've been working on in the background for a while,\" said Steve Sinch, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThat backup plan could have the astronauts returning on board SpaceX's Dragon Crew-9 instead of Starliner.\n\n\"If they do switch to the SpaceX capsule, that's a huge deal. That's a really significant deal,\" Colonel Terry Virts, a former Commander of the ISS, told us. \"Their top goal is to bring them back down on the Boeing capsule they went up on, but NASA won't do it unless it's safe.\"\n\nVirts knows what it's like to be stuck on the ISS. He was on board for an extra month during his last space mission.\n\n\"I'm sure they're enjoying their time in space. You never know when your next space mission is,\" Virts said. \"Really, it's a bummer for the families. They're the ones I always think of. They had plans for the summer and for the new school year. Now those plans have to change.\"\n\nThe problems with Starliner began as it closed in on the space station a day after its June 5 launch and last-minute thruster failures almost derailed the docking. Five of the capsule's 28 thrusters went down during docking; all but one thruster was restarted.\n\nStarliner already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit and several more leaks sprung up during the flight. Helium is used to pressurize fuel for the thrusters. Boeing said this week that the two problems aren't a concern for the return trip.\n\nIn delaying the astronauts' return, NASA and Boeing said they needed more time to collect information about the thruster trouble and leaks while the capsule was docked. Both are in the service module, a unit attached to the capsule that burns up during reentry.\n\nIf NASA decides it's unsafe to bring the astronauts home onboard Starliner, the spacecraft would eventually return on its own without a crew.\n\n\"As an American, I hope Boeing succeeds. It's important for NASA and the country that this is a successful mission for Boeing,\" Virts said.\n\nBoeing officials were not on Wednesday's conference call.

After weeks of denial from NASA, reality has set in: American astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are indeed shipwrecked in space, stranded on the International Space Station (ISS). Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which sent them into orbit in early June, is so far deemed incapable of returning them safely to Earth.\n\nNASA could therefore call on Elon Musk and his company SpaceX, pushing the astronauts' date of return back to February 2025. \"We're in a kind of a new situation here in that we've got multiple options,\" said former astronaut Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator. \"We don't just have to bring a crew back on Starliner, for example. We could bring them back on another vehicle.\"\n\nThe case threatens the very existence of Boeing's Starliner space program and makes SpaceX, the US federal authorities' preferred spacecraft manufacturer, more reliable and cheaper than ever before. The competition between Boeing and Elon Musk's firm began in 2014, when NASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX, to create vehicles to carry astronauts into space.\n\nMusk's company successfully completed its first manned flight in May 2020 to applause from then-president Donald Trump, and has since completed eight manned flights to the ISS for NASA. A first since the shutdown of NASA's Space Shuttle in 2011. At the time, the Boeing project was racking up setbacks, with 80 failures identified in an independent audit. Its program was years behind schedule, with cost overruns in excess of $1.4 billion.\n\nThe fiasco of this first manned flight is a further humiliation for Boeing, which pushed ahead with sending the astronauts in the spring. In May, the flight had to be canceled due to a \"small\" helium leak. On June 1, the flight was canceled due to a computer failure 3.5 minutes before launch. The astronauts eventually took off on June 5, but in retrospect it appears that Boeing, which is in the crosshairs of the US authorities for its safety failures and repeated lies in the field of civil aviation, was not up to scratch.\n\nDuring the approaching flight to the ISS, helium leaks continued, while five of the Starliner's 28 thrusters stopped at some point during the flight. Boeing had claimed to have repaired four, neutralized one and minimized the problems, but NASA wanted to reinforce the safety of the return trip.\n\nThe matter is reportedly the subject of heated disagreements within NASA and with Boeing. The main problem concerns undocking from the station: If too many thrusters fail again before the capsule has moved far enough away, Starliner could become uncontrollable and collide with the ISS. The thrusters are also needed to give the capsule sufficient energy to leave orbit and return to Earth. This is a very dangerous journey, as the extreme speed heats up the capsule as it enters the atmosphere.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

to the International Space Station for the first NASA astronauts to fly with Boeing could extend to eight months, with the agency considering bringing them home on a SpaceX spaceship.\n\nA final decision on whether to persist with Boeing's troubled Starliner - which experienced worrying propulsion issues as it flew up to the orbital platform in June - is expected later this month, officials said yesterday.\n\nDetailed planning is already under way with Boeing's rival SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, to potentially launch their scheduled Crew-9 mission on 24 September with just two astronauts rather than the usual four.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule would then be able to return to Earth with Starliner's crew of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in February 2025 - in what would amount to a major embarrassment for aerospace giant Boeing.\n\nIn this scenario, Starliner would fly back without crew before Crew-9 launches.\n\nSteve Stich, programme manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, revealed that there had been intense discussions on the best way forward, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft after carrying out ground testing to replicate the technical issues seen in space.\n\n\"I think the NASA community in general would like to understand a little bit more of the root cause and the physics,\" he said.\n\nNotably absent from the briefing were representatives from Boeing, heightening the perception of a rift.\n\nOn 2 August, the company released a blog update stating it \"remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.\"\n\nWatch: Boeing's Starliner astronauts arrive at ISS\n\nDesign flaws\n\nNASA and Boeing have been conducting tests at the White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico to better understand why some of Starliner's thrusters experienced a loss of power as it approached the ISS, and why it sprung several leaks of helium, used to pressurize the propulsion system.\n\nMr Stich said the latest analysis of why the thrusters failed pointed to the flow of fuel being choked within a \"poppet\" valve, as well as overheating causing some fuel to vaporize.\n\nOfficials previously said the helium leaks might be due to the use of undersized seals.\n\nNASA's Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, insisted that returning with Starliner remained the \"prime option.\"\n\nHowever, if Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams return with SpaceX, it would mark the biggest setback to date for Boeing's space program, as the century-old company continues to reel from the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS following the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, which left the United States reliant on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its crew.\n\nSpaceX succeeded in its first crewed test in 2020 and has carried dozens of people since.\n\nBoeing's programme, by contrast, has faced numerous delays amid setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe crewed test itself experienced two aborted launch attempts that came as the astronauts were strapped in and ready for liftoff.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score":

It appears they are eating well, with access to scrambled eggs, fruit and vegetables, stews and pastas as well snacks such as granola bars, trail mixes, juices, tea and coffee.\n\nHowever, much of these foods would be rehydratable and thermostablilized, meaning the astronauts would have to add water before eating.\n\nWill their food supplies run out?\n\nAI doesn't think so. \"The International Space Station (ISS) is designed with extensive planning for life support, including food supplies, to ensure the safety and well-being of astronauts,\" it said.\n\n\"The planning for additional crew members starts well in advance to ensure that the necessary supplies are sent to the station on time.\"\n\nThe station welcomes regular resupply missions and follows careful food management systems and has a contingency plan in place.\n\nAI added: \"The ISS is unlikely to run out of food due to the addition of more astronauts.\n\nCan the International Space Station accomodate extra astronauts for extended stays?\n\nThe ISS has \"some flexibility to host extra crew members for extended stays under certain conditions,\" AI suggested.\n\nThe space station usually accommodates around six crew members but can accommodate up to 11 astronauts.\n\nIn addition to a well-planned food-supply chain, the space station has considered addition escape vehicles and has robust safety protocols in place, and the station's air supplies and environmental conditions can be adjusted to accommodate more people.\n\nWhat health problems do Captain Williams and Commander Wilmore face?\n\nWithout Earth's gravity, extended space stays for longer than six months could result in a litany of health problems, according to AI.\n\nThese include reduction of heart function, cognitive changes, bone density loss, changes in vision and muscle atrophy.\n\nMost likely, the pair will be doing daily exercises to mitigate the risks of these issues.\n\nHow will they return to Earth?\n\nIf the Boeing Starliner remains out of action, the pair may return on the planned SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, which would depart Earth with two astronauts instead of four.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, Williams and Wilmore would become part of the ISS's overall Crew-9 rotation, meaning the pair would be stuck on the station for a further six months. While this looks the most likely scenario, reports CNN, it's still not a concrete plan.\n\nSteve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager said: \"We haven't approved this this plan.\n\n\"We've done all the work to make sure this plan is there; we have the suits identified to fly up on Crew-9 (for Williams and Wilmore to wear aboard Crew Dragon).\n\n\"But we have not turned that on formally, as that's the path that we're going to go down.\"\n\nWhat will happen to the Starliner?\n\nIf the captain and the commander return to Earth on a different mission, the Starliner will fly back to NASA empty, reports CNN.\n\nAs this failed mission was part of the craft's final testing stages for certification, NASA will then have to decide if the Starliner can make routine trips into space in the future. The space agency will base this on data collected during the mission.\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking here .", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zita_whalley@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Zita Whalley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(naval)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (naval)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33422496.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-SPACE-BOEING-STARLINER.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-05", "textStart": 554, "textEnd": 560}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Turns out Boeing has more problems. This time, the stranded folks are in space. Nice work, everyone.\n\nAs U.S. News and World Report noted in a Wednesday piece, while the Starliner launched in early June for a crewed test flight, its time in space was expected to be brief. Now, the crew is stuck on the ISS seven weeks past the time they were supposed to return to Earth -- and it's unclear when that will happen or whether it'll even happen in the Starliner.\n\n\"We're in a kind of a new situation here in that we've got multiple options,\" NASA's Ken Bowersox said at a Wednesday media briefing.\n\n\"We don't just have to bring a crew back on Starliner, for example. We could bring them back on another vehicle.\"\n\nHowever, that option would involve a SpaceX capsule that doesn't launch until February of next year. If that happens, then the Starliner would fly back to Earth without a crew.\n\nSeveral problems have plagued the Starliner in space and delayed its launch on the ground. Several of the thrusters shut down during approach to the ISS; while they've returned to normal levels, according to tests, NASA and Boeing officials are still assessing the situation.\n\nPerhaps more worrying are several leaks in the craft's helium system, which are in the ship's propulsion system.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, NASA is looking to make a final call about whether to return the crew on the Starliner or send a SpaceX craft up to \"rescue\" them sometime in the middle of August.\n\n\"Tensions between Boeing and some NASA leaders surfaced last week when officials couldn't agree on using Starliner, and a detailed review of Starliner's readiness for the flight back was postponed, according to people familiar with the situation,\" the paper reported Wednesday.\n\n\"The real disagreements are how much uncertainty they view in the data\" and the risks associated with it, said Steve Stich, a NASA manager.\n\n\"Starliner's inaugural flight has led to a summer of scrutiny on a craft that Boeing has been developing for years. NASA wants both Boeing and SpaceX vehicles available to ferry crew to the space station, which officials have said would help ensure continuous access,\" the Journal noted.\n\nHowever, now that an eight-day mission is over two months old, thanks to problems partially identified on the launchpad, this is looking grimmer for Boeing by the day.\n\nIf the crew returns in the Starliner and there's any problem -- even one that doesn't cause a disaster -- it looks like a problem of 737 Max proportions for the American aircraft manufacturer. It's already another black eye on the company's reputation, which has caused significant resentment between Boeing officials and NASA.\n\n\"We continue to support NASA's requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft's safe undocking and landing capabilities,\" Boeing said, according to U.S. News and World Report.\n\n\"Our confidence is based on this abundance of valuable testing from Boeing and NASA. The testing has confirmed 27 of 28 RCS thrusters are healthy and back to full operational capability.\n\n\"Starlneir's propulsion system also maintains redundancy, and the helium levels remain stable. The data also supports root cause assessments for the helium and thruster issues and flight rationale for Starliner and its crew's return to Earth.\"\n\nWould you trust that \"flight rationale\"? Probably not, especially when you consider that outlets like Fast Company have released articles instructing travelers on how to avoid flying a 737 Max.\n\nWhen people aren't willing to take the company's considerably less-complex jets, why would we expect them to get on the Starliner again?

SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, to potentially launch their scheduled Crew-9 mission on September 24 with just two astronauts rather than the usual four.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule would then be able to return to Earth with Starliner's crew of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in February 2025 -- in what would amount to a major embarrassment for aerospace giant Boeing.\n\nIn this scenario, Starliner would fly back without crew before Crew-9 launches.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I

forward, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft after carrying out ground testing to replicate the technical issues seen in space.\n\n\"I think the NASA community in general would like to understand a little bit more of the root cause and the physics,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotably absent from the briefing were representatives from Boeing, heightening the perception of a rift.\n\nOn August 2, the company released a blog update stating it \"remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.\"\n\nDesign flaws\n\nNASA and Boeing have been conducting tests at the White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico to better understand why some of Starliner's thrusters experienced a loss of power as it approached the ISS, and why it sprung several leaks of helium, used to pressurize the propulsion system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStich said the latest analysis of why the thrusters failed pointed to the flow of fuel being choked within a \"poppet\" valve, as well as overheating causing some fuel to vaporize.\n\nOfficials previously said the helium leaks might be due to the use of undersized seals.\n\nNASA's Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, insisted that returning with Starliner remained the \"prime option.\"\n\nHowever, if Wilmore and Williams return with SpaceX, it would mark the biggest setback to date for Boeing's space program, as the century-old company continues to reel from the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS following the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, which left the United States reliant on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its crew.\n\nSpaceX succeeded in its first crewed test in 2020 and has carried dozens of people since.\n\nBoeing's program, by contrast, has faced numerous delays amid setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe crewed test itself experienced two aborted launch attempts that came as the astronauts were strapped in and ready for liftoff.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType":

Therefore, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are looking at their 8-day trip morphing into a 8-month excursion.\n\nThe two astronauts who have already been stuck in space for more than 60 days may have to wait until early 2025 before they can return to Earth -- following a trip to the International Space Station that was supposed to last just eight days.\n\nNASA also acknowledged that the astronauts, who arrived on the maiden voyage of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, may have to be rescued by the rival SpaceX CrewDragon, though that vessel won't be ready until February.\n\nOn Wednesday, NASA announced another delay in bringing home Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams during a news conference, with the agency saying it's now looking more closely at an alternative plan utilizing SpaceX's Crew-9 mission.\n\nIf tests in the coming weeks suggest that making the trip home on Starliner proves too risky, Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, said Wilmore and Williams would have no choice but to hop on Crew-9's return flight in February 2025.\n\nThe decision is not final, but there have been rumblings from the NASA team about Boeing. A lot of trust has been lost, and goodwill has been squandered.\n\nWhile Boeing has long been one of NASA's most trusted partners, the space agency's confidence in the company has languished, according to a person familiar with the thinking of NASA's leadership.\n\n\"They just don't trust Boeing anymore,\" said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \"There's been lots of times when they said, 'This is good,' and it turns out not to be good.\"\n\nIf NASA abandons Starliner for the return mission and use SpaceX's Dragon as a rescue craft, it would be another humiliating blow for Boeing. The company's commercial airliner program has been reeling since fatal 737 Max disasters in 2018 and 2019, and assembly problems have been exposed by an incident this January, when a door panel blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\nAdding more complexity to an already complex situation, the Starliner undocking software must be rewritten because the crew will likely no longer be onboard when the craft next detaches from the ISS.\n\nAlthough the capability to undock without a crew exists within the flight software on Starliner, it is currently configured for crew operations. That is, during the process of undocking and moving away from the space station, the flight software takes certain actions, and the crew takes certain actions. This configuration change toward integrated operations between software and crew was made after the previous autonomous flight of Starliner in 2022 that flew to the space station and back.\n\n\"Essentially, what we're asking the team is to go back two years in time and resurrect the software parameters that are required to give automatic responses to breakouts near the ISS should we have problem in close to ISS, which the software now allows them to do manually,\" [Steve Stich, NASA Commercial Crew program manager] said. \"The team is always updating these mission data loads as different things change.\"\n\nNo work has been done on the autonomous software package since the flight in 2022. Ars reported it would take about four weeks to complete testing of this configuration change, and Stich confirmed this.\n\nIn his recent Substack, Glenn Reynolds reviews the institutional competence crisis, summarizing that when nobody's life or livelihood is on the line, systems get \"soggy.\"\n\nThe Secret Service, whose failures in securing Trump's Butler, PA speech are legendary and frankly hard to believe at this point, is one example. (Nor is the Butler event the Secret Service's first embarrassment.)\n\nThe Navy, whose ships keep colliding and catching fire.\n\nMajor software vendor Crowdstrike, whose botched update shut down major computer systems around the world.\n\nThe United States government, which built entire floating harbors to support the D-Day invasion in Europe, but couldn't build a workable floating pier in Gaza.\n\nHopefully, competence in all the systems will be restored sooner rather than later. I look forward to reporting on the successful return of the Starliner crew -- maybe in time for Valentine's Day.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leslie_eastman@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Leslie Eastman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LI-80-starliner-crew.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It is a true national tragedy.'\n\nProblems with Boeing's commercial jets, including turbulence, mechanical issues and tail strikes, have cost the company at least $3 billion.\n\nBoeing's Starliner (pictured in this post) was only meant to dock with the ISS for eight days, but there are now concerns it may not be safe to return with a crew\n\nAnd NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to build Starliner as a taxi for astronauts to the ISS.\n\nA meeting this week of NASA's CCP, which oversees Starliner, ended with some officials disagreeing on a plan to accept Boeing's testing data and use Starliner to bring the astronauts home.\n\n'We didn't poll in a way that led to a conclusion,' Mr Stich said.\n\nKen Bowersox, NASA's space operations chief, added: 'We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear.'\n\nWhile no decision has been made on using Starliner or SpaceX's Crew Dragon, NASA has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner.\n\nSometime next week is when NASA expects to decide, officials said.\n\nStarliner has faced numerous technical issues since its launch, including thruster failures and helium leaks. A situation which one commenter compared to a broken down car\n\nHOW DO ASTRONAUTS GO TO THE TOILET?\n\nOn board the ISS there is a toilet which has several attachments.\n\nAs there is no gravity in space, liquids do not flow but accumulate in floating globules.\n\nTo counter this problem, there are hoses which are used and provide pressure to suck the fluid from the body.\n\nEach astronaut has their own personal attachment.\n\nWhen a toilet is not available or the astronaut is on a space-walk, the astronauts use MAGs (maximum absorbency garments) which are diapers that soak up all the waste.\n\nThey are effective for short missions but have been known to leak occasionally.\n\nNasa is aiming to develop a suit which allows for long-term spacesuit usage and complete independent disposal of human waste.\n\nOn the moon missions there was no toilet and the all-male crew had 'condom catheter's that attached to the penis and the fluid was fed to a bag that resided outside of the suit.\n\nAccording to an 1976 interview with astronaut Rusty Schweickart, the condom catheters came in three sizes: small, medium and large.\n\nDespite the practical advantages of having the right size, the astronauts often ordered the large ones and this resulted in a leakage of urine in the suit.\n\nTo combat this, Nasa renamed the sizes as large, gigantic, and humongous to appease the male ego.\n\nThere has yet to be an effective female equivalent developed, something Nasa aims to change for the Orion missions.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Starliner crew", "body": "A final decision on whether to persist with Boeing's troubled Starliner -- which experienced worrying propulsion issues as it flew up to the orbital platform in June -- is expected later this month, officials said Wednesday in a call with reporters.\n\nDetailed planning is already underway with Boeing's rival SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, to potentially launch their scheduled Crew-9 mission on September 24 with just two astronauts rather than the usual four.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule would then be able to return to Earth with Starliner's crew of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in February 2025 -- in what would amount to a major embarrassment for aerospace giant Boeing.\n\nIn this scenario, Starliner would fly back without crew before Crew-9 launches.\n\nSteve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, revealed that there had been intense discussions on the best way forward, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft after carrying out ground testing to replicate the technical issues seen in space.\n\n\"I think the NASA community in general would like to understand a little bit more of the root cause and the physics,\" he said.\n\nNotably absent from the briefing were representatives from Boeing, heightening the perception of a rift.\n\nOn August 2, the company released a blog update stating it \"remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.\"\n\n- Design flaws -\n\nNASA and Boeing have been conducting tests at the White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico to better understand why some of Starliner's thrusters experienced a loss of power as it approached the ISS, and why it sprung several leaks of helium, used to pressurize the propulsion system.\n\nStich said the latest analysis of why the thrusters failed pointed to the flow of fuel being choked within a \"poppet\" valve, as well as overheating causing some fuel to vaporize.\n\nOfficials previously said the helium leaks might be due to the use of undersized seals.\n\nNASA's Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, insisted that returning with Starliner remained the \"prime option.\"\n\nHowever, if Wilmore and Williams return with SpaceX, it would mark the biggest setback to date for Boeing's space program, as the century-old company continues to reel from the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS following the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, which left the United States reliant on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its crew.\n\nSpaceX succeeded in its first crewed test in 2020 and has carried dozens of people since.\n\nBoeing's program, by contrast, has faced numerous delays amid setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe crewed test itself experienced two aborted launch attempts that came as the astronauts were strapped in and ready for liftoff.", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Perhaps the most discussed plan is to have Wilmore and Williams return on board SpaceX's Crew-9 spacecraft early next year.\n\nBut in case things didn't go according to plan, NASA has also been considering a far more eccentric option: stuffing Wilmore and Williams into SpaceX's already fully occupied Crew-8 spacecraft, which delivered a crew of four to the ISS in early March and is still currently docked to the ISS alongside the troubled Starliner.\n\n\"We have a task order in place to allow up to three crew members on the cargo pallet using the foam configuration in the Crew-8 Dragon,\" the head of NASA's commercial crew program Steve Stich revealed during a conference call today.\n\nIn other words, if push comes to shove, NASA would consider cramming Williams and Wilmore into the negative space surrounding the four occupied seats -- highlighting the lengths the agency is willing to go to ensure its astronauts' safe return.\n\nHaving a crew of six climb into SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft isn't quite as outlandish as it sounds. The space company originally designed the capsule to house up to seven passengers, but NASA has opted to send crews of four to the ISS since its first official crew rotation mission involving the spacecraft in November 2020.\n\nSince at least 2022, NASA has been assessing how to accommodate up to seven crew members in the capsule, an investigation spurred by Russia's Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft springing a leak and spraying coolant into outer space.\n\nNASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who launched to the ISS in July 2022 on board the leaking capsule, had his stay on board the ISS extended considerably due to the leak, consequently breaking the record for the longest spaceflight by an American astronaut.\n\nAt the time, NASA floated the idea of moving his Soyuz seat to SpaceX's Crew-5 Dragon in case of an emergency, increasing the number of occupants from four to five. Rubio, however, returned to Earth on board a substitute Soyuz capsule that was sent to the space station in October.\n\nDuring today's conference call, ISS program manager Dana Weigel recalled the event to discuss the option of having Wilmore and Williams return in an already full-up Dragon spacecraft.\n\n\"We put in place a capability that allowed for a five crew return with the Dragon,\" she said. \"When we did that, we used the seat liner as the cushion on the Dragon cargo pallet for Frank [Rubio], and what we realized after that is ideally we wouldn't be taking the Soyuz seat liner and moving it. It is vulnerable to damage.\"\n\nAs a result, NASA had to come up with an alternative that involved \"using a different foam basically for the cushioning and didn't require us to move the seat liner.\"\n\n\"That's actually the generic contingency configuration that we plan to use for all of our Soyuz crew members if we ever encounter a Soyuz vehicle issue and need to use the Dragon,\" Weigel said.\n\nIn the case of an emergency, this same plan could be applied to Williams and Wilmore's makeshift seats on board Crew-8.\n\nIn July, NASA awarded SpaceX a $266,000 task order to examine whether it could fit more than four crew members on Crew Dragon. At the time, NASA claimed the order was related to the Soyuz coolant leak, not Starliner.\n\nNASA has yet to make an official call. Task order or not, the two far more likely outcomes are for NASA to either risk sending Williams and Wilmore back home on board Boeing's leaking spacecraft or -- in a vote of no confidence -- delay their return by securing two seats on Crew-9 and sending Starliner back to Earth without a crew.\n\nThe space agency isn't exactly in an enviable position, and officials will likely spend the next few weeks or so poring over the data NASA and Boeing have collected so far.\n\nThe agency is giving itself until \"mid-August\" to make a decision, according to today's call.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rubio_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rubio (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Crew-5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-22", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz MS-22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2024/08/nasa-stuff-extra-astronauts-spacex-starliner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1665, "textEnd": 1678}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This forced the astronauts to remain aboard the ISS for two months while Nasa figured out how to get them home.\n\nWhile Nasa is still looking at ways it could continue to use Starliner to bring the astronauts back to Earth earlier, it is also considering bringing them home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule in 2025.\n\nSteve Stich, the manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme, said: \"Our prime option is to return Butch and Sunny on Starliner; however, we have done the requisite planning to make sure we have other options open.\n\n\"We have been working with SpaceX to ensure that they're ready to respond... if we need that.

However, the 2019 launch ultimately ended in failure due to an unforeseen software glitch. While the capsule was able to reach orbit and land safely, a software problem prevented it from docking successfully with the ISS.\n\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but yet another last-minute glitch forced Boeing to abandon its efforts. Engineers worked to tackle and repair technical issues, such as malfunctioning valves.\n\nIn May 2022, when another launch was attempted, an issue with the propulsion system was blamed, although Starliner did eventually manage to leave Earth and complete its full mission.\n\nWhen Nasa announced that SpaceX and Boeing would take over from the old space shuttles, it gave them both a similar contract, one that would bring their capsules into service and then pay for six operational missions.\n\nThe SpaceX contract was worth $2.6bn and Boeing's $4.2bn.

But for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, it's a reality. Their supposed eight-day mission is set to last until 2025 after their Boeing Starliner suffered issues with its propulsion system when docking to the International Space Station.\n\nIn its press conference on Wednesday (Aug 7), NASA revealed that the two stranded astronauts may have to return to Earth on the SpaceX Dragon instead. Ken Bowersox, NASA's administrator for space operations, said that his team \"don't just have to bring a crew back on Starliner,\" hinting that they \"could bring them back on another vehicle.\" This would mean the stricken Starliner could undergo an uncrewed return if engineers can't resolve the misfiring issue involving five of its 28 reaction control thrusters.\n\nOriginally planned for launch in mid-August, SpaceX's Crew-9 mission might be delayed to late-September as a result, since it would involve only two astronauts rather than four, leaving two spare seats for the Starliner crew. This mission is expected to return to terra firma in around February 2025.\n\nIn a statement at the start of August, Boeing said it remained \"confident in Starliner's return with crew,\" but NASA's press conference -- absent a Boeing representative -- casts a shadow over such an ambition. The crux of the issue lies in whether engineers can work out the cause of the reaction control thrusters' abnormal behaviour, which Steve Sitch, NASA's commercial crew program manager, says \"would give us additional confidence to move forward to return Butch and Suni on this vehicle.\" The issue isn't surrounding whether Starliner can undock -- officials are more concerned about whether the vehicle will have sufficient power to maintain a controlled re-entry through Earth's atmosphere, a notoriously dangerous and difficult maneuver.\n\nStarliner's apparent failure is a significant blow for Boeing, a company that has tried its hardest to rub shoulders with SpaceX in the space flight realm for many years but has, ultimately, struggled to do so. This follows the grounding of its newest airplane, the 737 Max, following two fatal accidents caused by flight control failure. SpaceX, on the other hand, will be boosted by these events, acting as the solution to what is an increasingly difficult situation for its rival.\n\nNo final decisions have yet to be made, however, as NASA's control board is still working day and night to uncover the root of the problem and find data that might lead them in the right direction. However, with the Boeing Starliner having been docked for more than 60 days of its maximum 90, we can expect a definitive action plan within the next few weeks.\n\nSource: NASA YouTube, Space.com, The Guardian", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Bowersox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Bowersox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-international-space-station-with-a-distant-earth-in-the-background.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 404, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up with the ISS team. So yeah, it's great to be up here.'\n\nStranded astronauts onboard the International Space Station have resorted to a number of surprising measures to keep themselves entertained - including Olympics-inspired workouts\n\nSuni has been taking part in science experiments, including defying the station's microgravity to water plants\n\nSuni's positive nature will no doubt stand her in good stead during the extended stay. On June 11, days after arriving she tweeted to say she was having the 'best week ever!'.\n\n'So happy to be back in space and on (ISS). The ride was amazing, and being here with friends is just awesome,' she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a video showed the astronauts taking advantage of the zero gravity onboard to complete Olympics-inspired weightless workouts.\n\nThe conditions gave them a significant advantage, making somersaults and weightlifting appear easy.\n\nThe team also showed off their slow-motion running and discus throwing, while the hammer throw was noticeably easier.\n\nSince their arrival, the astronauts have been performing ultrasounds on their veins to collect data on how space affects the human body.\n\nThey have also been tasked with chores on board including swapping out a urine processing pump, as well as taking an inventory of food supplies onboard.\n\nThe science experiments include attempts to water plants in space, made difficult by the lack of gravity.\n\nSunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore have had their stay on the International Space Station extended indefinitely after hoping to visit the orbiting lab for 8 days\n\nBeing trapped in space hasn't stopped the astronauts from enjoying the Olympic Games\n\nThe Starliner is pictured docked in the International Space Station. The two astronauts who flew to space on the faulty aircraft remain trapped above the Earth indefinitely while NASA and Boeing probe a series of defects\n\nBy working with surface tension, hydroponics and air circulation, they have been able to redirect the water onto the plants, against the atmosphere of the space station.\n\nWilmore, 61, was tasked with servicing a pair of freezers used to hold research samples, as well as refilling the coolant in one of the station's water pumps.\n\nWilliams added: 'We've been doing science for them, maintenance - some major maintenance that's been waiting for a little while.\n\n'There's the urine processor pump that we took one good pump out. It's called Frankenpump - that's ready to go in case we have any problems with the system.\n\n'Butch and I just did a moderate temperature cooling refill. I got to do some gene sequencing. You got to do some other science experiments as well with a moon microscope that was 3D-printed.'\n\nThe Space station, which has been continuously occupied since November 2000, is more luxurious inside than you might think.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are still far from the record of most days spent in the station, after Peggy Whitson completed 665 days onboard in September 2017.\n\nAccording to NASA, the living and working space is larger than a six-bedroom house, with two bathrooms, a gym and a 360-degree view bay window.\n\nIt turns out microgravity offers a big advantage in Olympic activities, as astronauts were able to 'weightlift' two crew members\n\nThe team put on their own version of the Olympic Games, as Suni and Barry have now spent more than 60 days away from home\n\nThe Space Station is also a 'space laboratory' where crew members spend their time doing experiments. Barry is pictured\n\nThe astronauts have to work out for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass in microgravity.\n\nOnce a week Williams and Wilmore go into their Starliner craft and speak to their control team about things they've noticed while onboard and during their journey to the station.\n\nSince 2009, astronauts have been able to post updates to social media and can keep regular contact with Earth.\n\nAnd if they find themselves facing cabin fever, those onboard can go on spacewalks through airlocks that open to the outside.\n\nAs only six crew members are allowed onboard at a time, they are also responsible for maintaining and repairing the space station.\n\nThe ISS makes 16 orbits of earth every single day and astronauts can choose to float around, or attach themselves to a wall.\n\nThruster failures and helium links on Boeing's new Starliner capsule mean Williams and Wilmore are staying in orbit longer than planned due to fears a trip back could end in disaster.\n\nAt a briefing, officials said that the Starliner was probably safe enough to fly the two home, but that decision would be made during a review.\n\nThe crew defied gravity to 'run' with the Olympic torch through the station\n\nThe team have been kept hard at work with ship maintenance, as only six are allowed on the ship at a time\n\nThe hammer throw in the 'Olympics' was made noticeably easier by the lack of gravity\n\nThe space agency and Boeing have repeatedly said that the astronauts are not stranded and that in case of an emergency they could fly home in Starliner.\n\nBut that has raised questions about why Williams and Wilmore can't just fly home now, if the Boeing craft really is safe. The work being done on the Starliner is also being performed remotely - with no engineer sent to space to work on the actual craft itself.\n\nNASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich acknowledge that backup options are being reviewed, including SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\nThe capsule blasted off from Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on June 5, with NASA saying a few hours later that the capsule had sprung two leaks.\n\nWhile the capsule docked at the station on June 6, another leak was found and days later on June 10 another was spotted.\n\nIn addition to the helium leaks, five thrusters temporarily malfunctioned during the flight but four came back online, with the fifth being shut off.\n\nIf the spacecraft was to suffer another failure on the way back to Earth, the consequences could be catastrophic for its occupants.\n\nThe Starliner fiasco heaps fresh embarrassment on Boeing, whose commercial aviation department has been plagued by scandals and crashes.\n\nThruster failures and helium links on Boeing's new Starliner capsule, seen here aboard a Atlas V rocket, has prompted NASA and Boeing to keep them in orbit for longer\n\nWilmore, left, and Williams pose for a portrait inside the vestibule between the forward port on the International Space Station's Harmony module and Boeing's Starliner\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams (left) and commander Butch Wilmore (right) prior to departure on June 5\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams (bottom left) and Butch Wilmore (bottom right) are seen here after safely arriving aboard the International Space Station\n\nThe crew has enough food rations for at least four months on the International Space Station\n\nEarlier this year, a 737 MAX plane burst open while flying over Portland, with two other MAX jets crashing in 2018 and 2019, killing more than 300.\n\nBoeing has been accused of putting profits before safety and has vowed to improve the quality of its products after the series of catastrophic failures.\n\nPrior to the flight, Williams said that she was aware that the nature of the test flight meant that her and Wilmore might have to improvise.\n\nShe said: 'We do anticipate everything's going to go as planned.

Here's what they'll do", "body": "(CNN) -- When astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore left Earth for International Space Station two months ago, they ditched their bags for a key piece of equipment. Helming the inaugural crewed flight test of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, they departed without their own toiletries and other personal comforts -- expecting to return to Earth within a week or so.\n\nThey've now been on the space station more than 60 days, however, and NASA raised the possibility this week that they may remain there through early 2025 because of ongoing issues with their Starliner capsule.\n\nSuch an extension is not certain, with NASA officials hoping to resolve some disagreements within the space agency about Starliner's safety. A decision, according to NASA, must be made by the middle of August.\n\nBut NASA indicated a monthslong continuation may be necessary if Starliner is deemed unsafe and they need to fall back on Plan B, with the astronauts coming home aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule instead.\n\nSo what exactly would Williams and Wilmore do for another six months in space?\n\nCurrently the two are guests. They're not part of Expedition 71, the international crew of seven astronauts serving as the space station's official staff. Nevertheless, NASA has said they've seamlessly integrated with the group, picking up everyday tasks aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nBut if their stay is extended through February, as NASA said may happen if Starliner can't bring them home, Williams and Wilmore would transition to be full-time expedition crew members.\n\nThey would take up typical crew tasks, such as conducting spacewalks outside the space station, maintaining the orbiting laboratory and carrying out a tight schedule of science experiments.\n\nAnd NASA confirmed the Starliner astronauts are prepared to make such a shift.\n\n\"A couple years ago, we made the decision -- knowing that this was a test flight -- to make sure that we had the right resources, supplies and training for the crew, just in case they needed to be on ISS, for whatever reason, for a longer period of time,\" Dana Weigel, NASA's manager of the International Space Station Program, said during a Wednesday briefing.\n\n\"Butch and Suni are fully trained,\" Weigel added. \"They're capable and current with EVA (spacewalks), with robotics, with all the things we need them to do.\"\n\nNothing is certain, but NASA indicated on Wednesday for the first time that it is considering flying the Boeing Starliner spacecraft home empty.\n\nBut that wouldn't leave Wiilliams and Wilmore in space indefinitely. They would be assigned a ride home on SpaceX's Crew-9 mission.\n\nCrew-9 -- a routine trip to the space station to replenish expedition staff -- is currently slated to fly with four astronauts: NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, Nick Hague and Stephanie Wilson, and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of the Russian space agency Roscosmos.\n\nUnder NASA's contingency plan for Starliner, two of those astronauts would be booted off that mission, though officials did not reveal which of the four crew members that might be.\n\nThe Crew Dragon spacecraft would then fly with two empty seats to the International Space Station -- taking off no earlier than September 24, based on the most recent dates shared by NASA.\n\nBallast, or hunks of metal that serve as dead weight, would fly alongside the two empty seats on Crew-9 to maintain the Crew Dragon's center of gravity.\n\nThe two Crew-9 astronauts would then join Williams and Wilmore aboard the space station, and all four would round out the cast of Expedition 72, which will include additional Russian cosmonauts and is slated to begin in September after a handover period.\n\nAs is typical for missions to the space station that join an expedition, the Crew-9 astronauts will stay on board for roughly five or six months -- leaving Williams and Wilmore in space for another half year in addition to the two months they've already spent in space.\n\nOnce part of Crew-9, they'll fall into a structured routine, with their days mapped out hour by hour.\n\nAlready, the astronauts have fallen into some of that day-to-day labor. Recent updates from NASA said Williams and Wilmore have used their time so far for space station upkeep, inspecting hardware, organizing cargo, performing checks on Starliner, and assisting with science experiments and tech demonstrations.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore, however, have also had opportunities for some fun in microgravity. NASA shared footage of the astronauts on July 26 as they passed around a plastic torch on the space station and mimicked Olympic events, including discus and pommel horse. (Working out is a key task for astronauts to avoid losing too much muscle and bone density while in space.)\n\nWilliams, for the record, has already proven her chops as a standout space athlete.\n\nIn 2012, during an earlier trip to the International Space Station, she became the first person to finish a triathlon in space. Williams used a stationary bike, simulated swimming with a weightlifting machine and ran on a treadmill while strapped in by a harness so she wouldn't float away.\n\nThat feat came after she ran along with the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore logged a combined total of 500 days in space before launching on the Starliner test flight. Williams even said that she cried after she left the space station following her last mission in 2012, unsure if she would ever return.\n\n\"This flight is a dream for her,\" one NASA commentator said during a June 5 livestream of the Starliner launch.\n\nIt's not uncommon for astronauts to unexpectedly extend their stay aboard the space station -- for days, weeks or even months.\n\nNASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, was slated to spend about six months aboard the International Space Station for his inaugural trip to low-Earth orbit that kicked off in September 2022. He instead logged 371 days in space following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride -- a Russian Soyuz capsule -- while docked to the orbiting outpost.\n\nRubio's yearlong stay ended up setting a US record for the most continuous days spent in orbit.\n\nAstronauts also routinely extend their stays on the station for days at a time for a variety of factors, including poor weather on Earth or other schedule adjustments.\n\nFlying to the space station without the suitcases they had packed for their mission perhaps complicated the comfort of the Starliner astronauts' extended stay. NASA opted to take their luggage off the spacecraft to make room for a much-needed pump to fix a malfunctioning toilet aboard the space station.\n\nThe two astronauts may have finally received a reprieve after a Northrop Grumman cargo resupply mission arrived at the space station on Tuesday.\n\n\"We do like to keep our options open so we do have some items such as clothes ... some personal food items for (Williams and Wilmore), things like that,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's operations integration manager for the International Space Station Program, during a news briefing last week.\n\nAnd there's no indication that food supplies are dwindling anytime soon. Packed along the Northrop Grumman ship's 8,200 pounds of science experiments and cargo was a food haul that included meals and produce such as squash, radishes, carrots, blueberries, oranges, apples and coffee, according to Spetch.\n\nStill, NASA must make a quick decision about Williams and Wilmore's return -- or integration into the normal crew rotation -- because the space station's stores of food and other resources are not unlimited.\n\n\"While they're up there, we have extra crew, we have extra hands, and they can do a lot more work. But they're also using up more consumables, more supplies,\" said Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, on Wednesday.\n\n\"At some point,\" he added, \"we need to bring those folks home and get back to a normal crew size on the ISS.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Not everyone at NASA thinks the spacecraft has been proven safe enough to bring them back from Earth orbit.\n\nWhen NASA's associate administrator of space operations Ken Bowersox addressed reporters on Wednesday, internal debates within the space agency surfaced. The concerns were regarding the safety of Starliner's two astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who've already been living in space two months longer than planned.\n\nThey flew into space on June 5 for what was, at the time, set as an eight-day mission. The mission was called Crew Flight Test and was meant to be a certification of Starliner's abilities to become a commercial crew program spacecraft -- second to the now tried-and-tested SpaceX Crew Dragon -- that could bring spacefarers to the International Space Station (ISS) and back safely at a low cost to NASA.\n\nWith Starliner, NASA seeks comfort. If something goes wrong in space or with SpaceX's launchers, astronauts can rely on Starliner to make it to space without interruption in the timelines.\n\nThings went awry soon into the mission. Thruster and helium leak anomalies didn't stop Starliner and its crew from successfully docking to the ISS, but raised serious concerns about how they would return home.\n\nProblems arise on test flights, and that's what the evaluative nature of these flights are for: to catch blindspots and remedy. But days, weeks and, now, months have passed.\n\nTo figure a way forward, NASA and Boeing have run hot fire tests of Starliner in space. And on Earth, engineers have put spare thrusters through the gamut at NASA's White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico to replicate the conditions that the hardware in space has gone through. They believe the thruster issue is due to overheating, plus swelling of a teflon seal that blocks the flow of fuel into the thruster's combustion chamber. \"What we're trying to do now is sort of understand what all that data means to us from the White Sands testing, and then what it means to the thrusters on orbit,\" NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said Wednesday.\n\nAs teams figure out the ramifications of the worst case scenario for thruster overheating, as well as of the helium leaks experienced during Starliner's journey to the ISS,the test crew remains in space. Their return date continued to be pushed into the future. Their arrival home could now be as late as next year.\n\nTensions clashed last month, when Boeing Commercial Crew Program manager Mark Nappi scolded reporters during a press briefing for using language that called the astronauts \"stranded\" or \"stuck\" in space. Reporters pushed back asking for clearer responses from NASA and Boeing leadership as to when they'd come home, and more frequent updates on the Starliner troubleshooting. Then during a follow-up media conference, Nappi and Stich expressed regret that they had outlined the mission as an eight-day event, to avoid scrutiny.\n\nTest flight or not, missions must adhere to schedule windows. The ISS is an aging spacecraft. To maintain its functions, astronauts are swapped in and out on assignments. Having two extra astronauts aboard the station strains the resources, occupancy, and schedules of the other space crews. That's not even taking into account the private, personal tolls that the extended missions may have on the crew. Or, the physical changes they'll experience as a result of longer periods in microgravity.\n\nAs a consequence of the idle Starliner, the SpaceX Dragon Crew-9 mission will no longer launch in mid-August with its crew of four. Its launch date has been pushed to September 24. Its crew is also now halved, which opens up two free seats for Wilmore and Williams to return home as a backup plan. But Crew-9 wraps up its six-month mission in February 2025, meaning the Starliner crew would come home eight months past schedule.\n\nThe same day that Bowersox and his colleagues announced the new Crew-9 launch date, he opened up about the internal discussions that have kept the Starliner crew from returning home.\n\n\"It's been really great to watch our team working, our Boeing team, our NASA team, the way people are speaking up. The way we're hearing different voices, different thoughts on how critical different factors are in the decision,\" Bowersox said Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's been very healthy. I have to admit that sometimes when we get disagreement, it's not fun. It can be painful having those discussions. But it's what makes us a good organization. And it's what will get us to a good decision as we approach that point here in the future. And I don't think we're too far away from making that call,\" he added.\n\nStarliner may still yet return with its crew. Data from recent tests and new evaluations might finally bring the team to a consensus for how -- and when -- to finally bring Williams and Wilmore home.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Bowersox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Bowersox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_chamber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combustion chamber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/8/8/442d68fa/the-united-launch-alliance.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-05", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 570}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 3696, "textEnd": 3708}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 460899641, "relevance": 2}

Why the return date of two NASA astronauts is up in the air until early next year.", "body": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are welcomed by the crew of the International Space Station upon their arrival using the Boeing Starliner spacecraft on June 6, 2024. They might not return to Earth until next year.\n\nNASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station, after repeatedly delaying their return aboard Boeing's troubled capsule.\n\nDo they take a chance and send them home soon in Boeing's Starliner? Or wait and bring them back next year with SpaceX?\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, their planned eight-day mission at the two-month mark and possibly surpassing eight months.\n\nTesting continues, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft but NASA divided. A decision is expected next week.\n\nThis is Boeing's first time launching astronauts, after flying a pair of empty Starliners that suffered software and other issues. Even before Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams blasted off June 5, their capsule sprang a leak in propulsion-related plumbing. Boeing and NASA judged the small helium leak to be stable and isolated, and proceeded with the test flight. But as Starliner approached the space station the next day, four more leaks erupted. Five thrusters also failed.\n\nThe capsule managed to dock safely, and four of the thrusters ultimately worked. But engineers scrambled, conducting thruster test-firings on the ground and in space. After two months, there's still no root cause for the thruster malfunctions. All but one of the 28 thrusters seem OK, but the fear is that if too many conk out again, the crew's safety could be jeopardized. The thrusters are needed at flight's end to keep the capsule in the right position for the critical deorbit burn.\n\nNASA bristles at suggestions that Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams are stranded or stuck. NASA has stressed from the get-go that in an emergency at the space station - like a fire or decompression - Starliner could still be used by the pair as a lifeboat to leave. A former NASA executive said on Aug. 8 the astronauts are \"kind of stuck,\" although certainly not stranded. They're safe aboard the space station with plenty of supplies and work to do, said Scott Hubbard.\n\nIf NASA decides to go with a SpaceX return, Starliner would be cut loose first to open up one of two parking spots for U.S. capsules. Before that happens Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams would fashion seats for themselves in the SpaceX Dragon capsule currently docked at the space station. That's because every station occupant needs a lifeboat at all times. Once Starliner's docking port is empty, then SpaceX could launch another Dragon to fill that slot - the one that Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams would ride.\n\nLike Boeing's Starliner, SpaceX's Dragon is meant to carry four astronauts. To make room for Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams, NASA said on Aug. 7 it could bump two of the four astronauts due to launch to the space station next month with SpaceX. The empty seats would be reserved for Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams, but they would have to remain up there until February. That's because station missions are supposed to last at least six months. Some have lasted a year. Two Russians up there right now will close out a yearlong stint when they return in a three-seat Soyuz capsule in September alongside a NASA crewmate. There's no thought given to ordering up a special SpaceX express, and the Dragon at the station now is the ride home next month for four residents.\n\nThis isn't the first time a U.S. astronaut has had their stay extended. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and his two Russian crewmates ended up spending just over a year in space after their docked Soyuz capsule was hit by space junk and leaked all its coolant. An empty Russian capsule was sent up to bring them back last September.\n\nMr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams are both retired Navy captains and longtime NASA astronauts who already have long space station missions behind them. Mr. Wilmore, 61, and Ms. Williams, 58, said going into this test flight that they expected to learn a lot about Starliner and how it operates. At their only news conference from space in July, they assured reporters they were keeping busy, helping with repairs and research, and expressed confidence in all the Starliner testing going on behind the scenes. There's been no public word from them yet on the prospects of an eight-month stay.\n\nMr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams' suitcases were removed from Starliner before liftoff to make room for equipment urgently needed for the space station's urine-into-drinking-water recycling system. So they made do with spare clothes already up there. A supply ship finally arrived this week with their clothes, along with extra food and science experiments for the entire nine-person crew. More supplies are due in a few more months. As for air, the space station has its own oxygen-generating systems. Despite the fat reserves, NASA would like to get back to normal as soon as possible. Besides Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams, there are four other Americans and three Russians on board.\n\nNASA deliberately hired two companies to get its crews to and from the space station, just as it did for delivering cargo. The space agency considered it an insurance policy of sorts: If one crew or cargo provider was grounded, the other could carry the load. \"You want to have another alternative both for cost reasons and for safety reasons and options. So NASA needs Boeing to be successful,\" said Mr. Hubbard, who served on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in 2003.\n\nEven with the latest setbacks, NASA insists it wants to keep using Boeing Starliners for astronaut rides. The goal is to send up one Dragon and one Starliner every year with crews, six months apart, until the station is retired in 2030. SpaceX has been at it since 2020.\n\nBoeing insists its capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home. But the company said on Aug. 7 it would take the steps necessary to bring the capsule back empty if that's NASA's decision. Last week, the company posted a list of all the tests that have been done on the thrusters since liftoff.\n\n\"We still believe in Starliner's capability and its flight rationale,\" the company said.\n\nA longtime space contractor, Boeing has had to overcome multiple Starliner problems over the years. The company had to launch an empty Starliner twice before committing to a crew, repeating the initial flight test because of bad software and other issues. The delays have cost the company more than $1 billion.\n\nMr. Hubbard questions whether NASA and Boeing should have launched the crew with the original helium leak, which cascaded into more.\n\n\"Whatever happens with the Starliner, they need to find out what the problem was and fix it,\" he said, \"And give everybody confidence they are still in the aerospace business in a major way.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nBoeing has seen a tide of bad headlines. It's hoping for a reset with space launch.\n\nBoeing's first spacecraft to carry a human crew launched from Florida in May. The Starliner is the second of two contracts NASA awarded to private companies to shuttle astronauts to the space station.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com", "name": "Christian Science Monitor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(fruit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (fruit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital maneuver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rubio_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rubio (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space debris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decompression sickness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2024/08/1179398_1_0809-nasa-astronauts-stuck_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800605", "eventUri": "eng-9800605", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-05", "textStart": 999, "textEnd": 1005}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2071, "textEnd": 2077}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2892, "textEnd": 2898, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 460912739, "relevance": 2}

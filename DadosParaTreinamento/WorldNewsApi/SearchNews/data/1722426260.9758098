And when you\u2019re enjoying a road trip through Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside, taking in the stunning scenery along the way, it brings things to a whole other level. For context, my boyfriend Josh and I booked a table at The Ghillies Bar \u2013 located in Ballater\u2019s five-star inn, the Balmoral Arms \u2013 on Saturday, May 11. The date may ring a bell as it was the hottest day recorded (in parts of) Scotland this year so far. We picked a scorcher. The pair of us travelled from Turriff, weaving our way around the twisty country roads and making a swift pitstop at Aboyne caf\u00e9 The Black Faced Sheep along the way. After parking by the Balmoral Arms early doors (since I heavily misjudged how long it would take us to reach the venue), we spent a short while soaking up the heart of the Victorian village. \u201cIs that a new shop?\u201d Josh asked as I popped my sunglasses on for the walk to the main entrance. We went for a snoop after I too noticed a flock of people, young and old, standing at the end of Victoria Road, which meets Bridge Street. It was in fact a queue coming from none other than Shorty\u2019s of Ballater. Josh\u2019s eyes lit up, but he soon got his ice cream fix, which I\u2019ll get to shortly\u2026 Our initial thoughts on The Ghillies Bar in Balmoral Arms There are three separate food and drink spaces in the Balmoral Arms \u2013 classic Scottish brasserie and grill 1852, The Ghillies Bar, and afternoon teas are served in the lounge. Escorted to a window side table in The Ghillies Bar, the room had a rustic, homely and cosy feel to it. There were fairy lights, sheepskin throws, plump tartan cushions and booth seating, plus walls adorned in framed pictures and drawings celebrating the local scenery, attractions and nature through the years (among other things). A large bar housed a fantastic selection of bottled and draft ales, as well as wines, gins and malt whiskies. I loved how many products were on offer by local businesses, such as Esker Spirits, Lost Loch Spirits and Cairngorm Brewery, to name a few. The pair of us agreed it felt like the ideal place to relax and unwind. With Josh on driving duties, he requested a non-alcoholic cider (\u00a34.50). I, on the other hand, asked if the team could rustle up a refreshing cocktail for me to sip away at. To my delight, one member revealed they \u201cmake a killer cosmo\u201d (\u00a311). They weren\u2019t lying. My vibrant sweet-sour drink hit the spot and paired fantastically with my starter. \u2018I never thought I\u2019d enjoy a salad so much\u2019: our thoughts on the starters After ordering, our starters arrived around five minutes later. Mine was spring/summer on a plate \u2013 the super salad bowl. My starter portion cost \u00a315. However, a larger (main) portion was also on the cards for an additional \u00a38. I never thought I\u2019d enjoy a salad so much, but it was one of the most colourful (and delicious) plates of food I\u2019ve had the pleasure of tucking into. A small ramekin filled with rich dill mayonnaise was placed in the centre of the bowl, while an assortment of vibrant and freshly-prepared ingredients surrounded it. They included thinly sliced smoked salmon, well seasoned roasted butternut squash, tart sliced apple, mixed greens, creamy (yet crunchy) cranberry slaw, buttery avocado, and tangy feta. There was also a fluffy pesto quinoa in the mix, which had a nutty and earthy taste. It was a delight, and I must admit I\u2019ve been hooked on avocado and quinoa ever since. With my main course being prepared in the kitchen, I had to stop myself from polishing off the portion. Josh, however, hoovered down his Charles Macleod Stornoway black pudding (\u00a38) in minutes. A soft-boiled egg (boasting a deep orange yolk) had been wrapped in a moist, meaty black pudding and fried, giving it a golden-brown and delightfully crunchy outer layer. Placed on a serving of homemade brown sauce, which was both sweet and peppery, and topped with watercress and celery salad, the textures were on point. Balmoral Arms serves traditional Scottish suppers made with locally sourced delights Next, the mains. Josh\u2019s fork and knife were at the ready as our server placed his Sheridan venison game pie (\u00a318) in front of him. Accompanied by pea pods, broccoli and mash, he doused everything in lashings of gravy. The pie comprised a thick, buttery and flakey crust that encased a considerable amount of soft venison chunks. The greens added some crunch, while the mash was silky-smooth. My truffled mushroom risotto (\u00a314) was another triumph. The combination of wild mushrooms, truffle oil and parmesan made for a savoury depth and a gorgeous nutty flavour, while the warming risotto itself melted in the mouth. Again, I was unable to finish the portion. The four dishes we ordered were substantial, thus superb value for money. Despite this, Josh wasn\u2019t done and went on to request a Tunnock\u2019s Teacake ice cream sundae (\u00a38). I told you he got his ice cream fix eventually\u2026 A sundae glass had been filled to the brim with indulgent ice cream, whipped cream, strawberry sauce and a crumbled Tunnock\u2019s Teacake. I couldn\u2019t resist having a spoonful. We would have loved more Tunnock\u2019s Teacake in the dessert as that chocolatey element was lacking a tad, and it balanced so well with the ice cream and cream. However, the sauce added a great level of sweetness and sharpness. The verdict There\u2019s something so special about Ballater. And after finally visiting The Ghillies Bar inside the Balmoral Arms, I adore the area even more. Our food was spectacular, and the staff were really helpful \u2013 particularly when the pair of us arrived 50 minutes before our booking slot. Whether you\u2019re passing or staying in Ballater, or simply fancy a road trip to a location that guarantees great scran, then The Ghillies Bar is certainly a place to consider.

All three parties in the alliance have seen their support decline.\n\nIn the European Parliament election last month, the chancellor's Social Democrats finished third with only 13.9% of the vote, their worst post-World War II showing in a nationwide election. That's far below the 25.7% support with which they narrowly won Germany's last national election in 2021.\n\nThe sag in support is an \"incentive\" to do better, and \"it is clear to me that we must convince people with our actions ... and with clarity,\" Scholz said at his annual summer news conference.\n\nA survey of members of his Social Democrats, or SPD, published Monday suggested only one-third thought he should run for chancellor again in the next election.\n\nScholz declined to comment on that and dismissed a question as to whether he might follow Biden's example. \"No, the SPD is a very united party; we are all firmly determined to go into the next election campaign together and to win it and I, as chancellor, will run to become chancellor again,\" he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz addresses the media during his summer press conference in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, July 24, 2024. (Britta Pedersen/dpa via AP)\n\nHe was largely tightlipped on the U.S. presidential election. Germany's last government, in which Scholz was vice chancellor, had sometimes-tense relations with the administration of Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee again.\n\n\"I will work well with any government in the U.S. - that is my job, that is the job of Germany and Europe. We place a great deal of value on the trans-Atlantic relationship,\" he said. He added that \"this is not just a transactional question that is about usefulness,\" but a matter of shared values such as the rule of law, democracy and freedom.\n\nAsked about his view of the Democratic hopeful, Vice President Kamala Harris, Scholz said that he's met her on several occasions and sees her as \"a competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she's doing and has very clear ideas about the role of her country.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz addresses the media during his summer press conference in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, July 24, 2024.

which has been scheduled for September.\n\n\"I will run as chancellor, to become chancellor again,\" Scholz told journalists at his annual summer press conference in Berlin.\n\nThe government has previously approved September 28, 2025 as the date for the election.\n\nScholz became chancellor after his center-left Social Democrats (SPD) won Germany's most recent general election in 2021.\n\nThe SPD formed a partnership with the Greens and the liberal FDP, but the parties have subsequently disagreed on a variety of topics, including climate policy and budget spending.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, the subsequent energy crisis, and high prices have all contributed to a general dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nAll three government parties have seen their ratings collapse, with the conservatives now the largest party and the far-right AfD coming in second.\n\nIn June's EU elections, the SPD received only 14 percent of the vote, its lowest ever.\n\nDuring the crisis, Scholz's popularity has dipped inside his own party.\n\nAccording to a recent survey, only one-third of SPD members believe he is the best choice for chancellor in 2025, with many preferring Defence Minister Boris Pistorius.\n\nBut Scholz on Wednesday said his party was \"very united behind what I am doing\".\n\n\"There has probably never been such a united SPD as the one we put together before the (2021) federal election and it managed to win the ... election from a difficult starting position,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe SPD had also been polling badly before the 2021 election but managed to stage a last-minute comeback, in part thanks to a weakened conservative camp that struggled to convince voters without former chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\"We will remain united and pursue our course,\" Scholz said.\n\nAsked about potential young SPD candidates to replace him, Scholz even suggested he could see himself staying on as chancellor for more than one more term.\n\nThe party will be ready for that \"at the end of the next legislative period or the one after that\", he said.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We place a great deal of value on the trans-Atlantic relationship,\" he said. He added that \"this is not just a transactional question that is about usefulness,\" but a matter of shared values such as the rule of law, democracy and freedom.\n\nAsked about his view of the Democratic hopeful, Vice President Kamala Harris, Scholz said that he's met her on several occasions and sees her as \"a competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she's doing and has very clear ideas about the role of her country.\"", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/00/47/25430478/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752290", "eventUri": "eng-9752290", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This has been reflected both in the polls and in the poor European election results last month.\n\nThe governing parties only received a third of the vote, with the SPD garnering 13.9 percent, its worst result ever in a nationwide election.

He also dismissed poor poll results for his party as merely a \"stimulus\" to do better, as he talked to journalists at a two-hour conference in Berlin before his summer vacation.\n\nScholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) suffered its worst nationwide election result at the European Parliament elections in early June, where it got just under 14% of the votes. The party's rating also stands at around 14%, according to ARD Deutschlandtrend survey results published in early July.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, his party was still \"determined to go into the next federal election campaign together and to win.\" He also admitted that the poll results were \"not good\" but stated that his party would be able to show that the SPD-led government made the right decisions during its tenure and would \"succeed in convincing everyone of this.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he himself would follow the footsteps of US President Joe Biden, who recently abandoned his 2024 re-election bid, Scholz maintained he was still determined to run and win in 2025.\n\n\"I will run for chancellor to become the chancellor again,\" he said. Under the German election system, a party that gets most of the people's votes at the federal parliamentary election normally gets a chance to form a government, usually in a coalition with other parties. Currently, the government coalition is led by Scholz's Social Democrats and also includes the Greens and the Free Democratic Party. Most major parties also usually name their chancellor candidates ahead of the vote as part of their election campaign.\n\nScholz himself called his party \"very united.\" Recent poll results published by the German media paint another picture. According to a survey conducted in early July, only a third of SPD members believe Scholz should run again as the party's candidate for chancellor, with 67% saying that a different candidate would give it a better chance of achieving a good result in next year's elections.\n\nA third of party members in particular named Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a suitable person for that role.

liberal FDP, but the parties have since clashed over a wide range of issues including climate measures and budget spending.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, the ensuing energy crisis and high inflation have also contributed to a general sense of discontent with the government.\n\nREAD ALSO: 'After UK and French elections, Germany's headaches this summer lie at home'\n\nAll three ruling parties have seen their ratings plummet, with the conservatives now the biggest party and the far-right AfD polling in second place.\n\nThe SPD scored its worst ever result in June's EU elections with just 14 percent.\n\nAmid the turmoil, Scholz has also seen his popularity slide within his own party.\n\nOnly one-third of SPD members believe he is the right candidate for chancellor in 2025, according to a recent survey - with Defence Minister Boris Pistorius the preferred option for many.\n\nBut Scholz on Wednesday said his party was \"very united behind what I am doing\".\n\n\"There has probably never been such a united SPD as the one we put together before the (2021) federal election and it managed to win the ... election from a difficult starting position,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe SPD had also been polling badly before the 2021 election but managed to stage a last-minute comeback, in part thanks to a weakened conservative camp that struggled to convince voters without former chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nREAD ALSO: What the shock defection of a Greens MP to the CDU tells us about German politics\n\n\"We will remain united and pursue our course,\" Scholz said.\n\nAsked about potential young SPD candidates to replace him, Scholz even suggested he could see himself staying on as chancellor for more than one more term.\n\nThe party will be ready for that \"at the end of the next legislative

He also dismissed poor poll results for his party as merely a \"stimulus\" to do better, as he talked to journalists at a two-hour conference in Berlin before his summer vacation.\n\nScholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) suffered its worst nationwide election result at the European Parliament elections in early June, where it got just under 14% of the votes. The party's rating also stands at around 14%, according to ARD Deutschlandtrend survey results published in early July.\n\nAccording to the chancellor, his party was still \"determined to go into the next federal election campaign together and to win.\" He also admitted that the poll results were \"not good\" but stated that his party would be able to show that the SPD-led government made the right decisions during its tenure and would \"succeed in convincing everyone of this.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he himself would follow the footsteps of US President Joe Biden, who recently abandoned his 2024 re-election bid, Scholz maintained he was still determined to run and win in 2025.\n\n\"I will run for chancellor to become the chancellor again,\" he said. Under the German election system, a party that gets most of the people's votes at the federal parliamentary election normally gets a chance to form a government, usually in a coalition with other parties. Currently, the government coalition is led by Scholz's Social Democrats and also includes the Greens and the Free Democratic Party. Most major parties also usually name their chancellor candidates ahead of the vote as part of their election campaign.\n\nScholz himself called his party \"very united.\" Recent poll results published by the German media paint another picture. According to a survey conducted in early July, only a third of SPD members believe Scholz should run again as the party's candidate for chancellor, with 67% saying that a different candidate would give it a better chance of achieving a good result in next year's elections.\n\nA third of party members in particular named Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a suitable person for that role. More than a half of the SPD members (51%) also believe the Social Democrats are in a serious crisis, according to the same poll conducted by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the RND media outlet. Still, as many as 55% of the SPD members also stated they were either \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with Scholz. The poll was conducted between July 8 and July 12 and involved 1,001 SPD members.\n\nData presented by the German private online statistics aggregator, Statista, showed that Scholz's popular support has hit one of its lowest points since early 2022, with only 28% of Germans assessing his work as a chancellor positively and 67% viewing it negatively in June.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARD_(broadcaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ARD (broadcaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free Democratic Party (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Pistorius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris Pistorius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsa_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forsa Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66a13a0785f54004af5b7e81.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752290", "eventUri": "eng-9752290", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2524, "textEnd": 2542}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Immigration is stabilizing Germany, said Scholz, but \"those who cannot stay must leave.\"\n\nScholz's first term in office was characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, and an economic downturn. In attempting to tackle the problems, his government coalition is divided on fundamental issues, with many disagreements becoming public.\n\nVoter support for the SPD and its two coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Greens, has dwindled in recent months. This has been reflected both in the polls and in the poor European election results last month.\n\nThe governing parties only received a third of the vote, with the SPD garnering 13.9 percent, its worst result ever in a nationwide election. The opposing conservative CDU/CSU union and the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AFD) came out on top, with a combined total of more than 45 percent.\n\nIn a ranking of satisfaction with German politicians, the chancellor is in the middle of the field. His party colleague Boris Pistorius, the defense minister, receives the most trust from voters, followed by CDU/CSU members who currently only have governing responsibility at state level.\n\nIn the run-up to the federal elections in September 2025, Scholz hopes to win back voter support with plans for modernization and cohesion. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free Democratic Party (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Pistorius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris Pistorius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU/CSU", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752290", "eventUri": "eng-9752290", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Agreeing the budget involved months of drawn-out negotiations and deepened already grave ideological differences over fiscal policy.\n\nScholz's SPD and the Greens wanted more spending on green policies, infrastructure and security, while the fiscally hawkish liberals insisted that the budget comply with Germany's strict constitutional curb on new borrowing, the so-called \"debt brake\".\n\nScholz's government had been in office for less than three months when Russia invaded Ukraine. Ever since, it has had to battle a profound energy crisis as well as high interest rates and inflation. Germany was the worst-performing major economy last year, and ministers expect growth of just 0.3 per cent in 2024.\n\nThe bad economic news has fuelled the rise of the Alternative for Germany, a far-right party that is expected to win three crucial regional elections in the east German states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg in September.\n\nMany in the SPD fear the party could lose control of Brandenburg, which it has ruled since German reunification in 1990.\n\nScholz held his press conference two days after a new poll showed that only a third of SPD members thought he was the right candidate for chancellor in next year's election.\n\nAnother third backed the popular defence minister Boris Pistorius, who has himself denied nurturing any ambition to succeed Scholz as chancellor.\n\nOnly 55 per cent of respondents in the Forsa poll said they were satisfied with the job Scholz was doing.\n\nScholz acknowledged the SPD needed to communicate more clearly to voters its various legislative achievements, such as increasing the minimum wage, pushing through tax breaks for low and middle earners, and guaranteeing the current level of the state pension.\n\nHe also hinted at the kind of election campaign he will run next year, emphasising the SPD's commitment to strengthening the German armed forces and modernising the economy -- particularly by encouraging investment by high-tech companies, speeding up planning procedures and reducing red tape.\n\nHe also projected a strong message on law and order, saying his government was committed to curbing illegal immigration and deporting greater numbers of failed asylum-seekers and foreign criminals.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

All three parties in the alliance have seen their support decline.\n\nAlso Read | US Shocker: Woman Jumps to Death out of Moving Car in Arizona During Police Chase After Boyfriend Allegedly Takes 20 Fentanyl Pills and Drives Vehicle up Mount Lemmon.\n\nIn the European Parliament election last month, the chancellor's Social Democrats finished third with only 13.9% of the vote, their worst post-World War II showing in a nationwide election. That's far below the 25.7% support with which they narrowly won Germany's last national election in 2021.\n\nThe sag in support is an \"incentive\" to do better, and \"it is clear to me that we must convince people with our actions ... and with clarity,\" Scholz said at his annual summer news conference.\n\nAlso Read | Indian Navy Successfully Evacuates Critically Injured Chinese Mariner From Bulk Carrier Zhong Shan Men off Mumbai Coast (See Pics and Video).\n\nA survey of members of his Social Democrats, or SPD, published Monday suggested only one-third thought he should run for chancellor again in the next election.\n\nScholz declined to comment on that and dismissed a question as to whether he might follow Biden's example. \"No, the SPD is a very united party; we are all firmly determined to go into the next election campaign together and to win it and I, as chancellor, will run to become chancellor again,\" he said.\n\nHe was largely tightlipped on the U.S. presidential election. Germany's last government, in which Scholz was vice chancellor, had sometimes-tense relations with the administration of Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee again.\n\n\"I will work well with any government in the U.S. -- that is my job, that is the job of Germany and Europe. We place a great deal of value on the trans-Atlantic relationship,\" he said. He added that \"this is not just a transactional question that is about usefulness,\" but a matter of shared values such as the rule of law, democracy and freedom.\n\nAsked about his view of the Democratic hopeful, Vice President Kamala Harris, Scholz said that he's met her on several occasions and sees her as \"a competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she's doing and has very clear ideas about the role of her country.\" (AP)\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

We are all determined to campaign together in the next federal election and to win. And I will run to become chancellor again,\" the Social Democratic Party (SPD) politician told reporters during his annual press talk on Wednesday, which lasted nearly two hours.\n\nThat decision, however, seems out of touch against the backdrop of June's European Parliament election. Voters in Germany delivered a crushing blow to the ruling coalition -- made up of Scholz's SPD, the Greens, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party -- handing the SPD its worst national vote result in more than a century.\n\nThe country's biggest opposition force -- an alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party (CSU) -- is currently polling in first place with around 31 percent, while the far-right Alternative for Germany is second with around 17 percent, leaving ruling coalition parties in the dust.\n\nIn a recent survey of the country's decision-makers and executives conducted by the Allensbach Institute, the CDU's Friedrich Merz -- expected to become Scholz's main opponent next year -- was preferred as Germany's next chancellor by 64 percent of respondents.\n\nThat's an increase of 17 percentage points compared to last year. Scholz, on the other hand, was supported by only 33 percent of respondents.\n\nPersistent coalition infighting since the government formed after Germany's 2021 election -- on everything from Russia's war in Ukraine, to a scheme to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, to budgetary shortfalls -- has delayed policymaking and destabilized the alliance.\n\n\"By the time elections for the German Bundestag are held, we will have turned things around,\" Scholz told reporters in Berlin. His Cabinet previously chose Sept. 28, 2025 as the date of the upcoming national vote; it will become official once the country's president signs off.\n\nBut questions remain about Scholz's popularity within his own ranks as well: Only one in three SPD members want him to run again for chancellor in the 2025 election, according to a Forsa survey published earlier this week.\n\n\"Bad survey results are a good incentive,\" Scholz said when asked about the poll. \"We have to be convincing through actions, through what we do and what we have done, and through clarity.\"\n\nThe German government's focus over the next 14 months will be on industrial growth, Scholz said, referring to recent investments and relocations in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy continues to contract, with manufacturing output falling in July to a three-month low, according to S&P Global's eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index.", "source": {"uri":

Voters in Germany delivered a crushing blow to the ruling coalition -- made up of Scholz's SPD, the Greens, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party -- handing the SPD its worst national vote result in more than a century.\n\nThe country's biggest opposition force -- an alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party (CSU) -- is currently polling in first place with around 31 percent, while the far-right Alternative for Germany is second with around 17 percent, leaving ruling coalition parties in the dust.\n\nIn a recent survey of the country's decision-makers and executives conducted by the Allensbach Institute, the CDU's Friedrich Merz -- expected to become Scholz's main opponent next year -- was preferred as Germany's next chancellor by 64 percent of respondents.\n\nThat's an increase of 17 percentage points compared to last year. Scholz, on the other hand, was supported by only 33 percent of respondents.\n\nPersistent coalition infighting since the government formed after Germany's 2021 election -- on everything from Russia's war in Ukraine, to a scheme to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, to budgetary shortfalls -- has delayed policymaking and destabilized the alliance.\n\n\"By the time elections for the German Bundestag are held, we will have turned things around,\" Scholz told reporters in Berlin.

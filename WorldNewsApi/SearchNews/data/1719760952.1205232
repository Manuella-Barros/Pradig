{"id": 225041450, "title": "Bombay HC issues notice on plea by Sachin Waze seeking bail in bribery case registered by CBI", "text": "The Bombay High Court on Wednesday issued a notice on a plea by dismissed police officer Sachin Waze seeking bail after being incarcerated for over two years in a corruption case involving former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and others. Waze claimed that he had spent over two years in prison in a case where no chargesheet had been filed despite having been granted pardon by the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court. A vacation bench of Justices Nitin R Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan issued a notice to the CBI and the Superintendent of the Taloja Central Prison where Waze is presently in judicial custody, seeking their response during the next hearing. Senior advocate Aabad Ponda and advocate Rounak Naik representing Waze argued that it was \"completely unfair\" for a person to be behind bars especially when the person was pardoned as approver. \"It is completely unfair for a person to stay behind bars. There is no chargesheet and I have been behind bars for over 2 years. Meanwhile, the others have been granted bail, so the trial will take at least 20 years. An approver who is never going to go to jail after the trial as he is a witness, is presently in jail. So essentially this is a challenge under Article 21 also,\" Ponda submitted. The bench has now posted the matter for hearing on June 14. Waze was arrested by the CBI in 2022 on allegations that he had collected bribes on behalf of Deshmukh from bar owners in Mumbai. As per Waze, on June 1, 2022, the CBI, under Section 306 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had granted consent for him to be made as approver in the case. On June 1, 2022, special CBI court granted leave to Waze to become an approver on his application under Section 306 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In his handwritten petition, Waze claimed that he had not been named as an accused in the chargesheet, but a witness. Despite this, his bail pleas were being rejected by the special court while the other accused were let out on bail, the plea argued. Waze sought direction from High Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus with an order that he be produced in court on the ground of wrongful detention. He also sought to be released under Section 167(2) of the CrPC as no chargesheet had been filed against him as an accused. Waze also challenged the constitutionality of Section 306(4) of the CrPC. The section deals with granting of pardon to accomplices and sub-section (4) states that the approver may be detained in prison till completion of the trial. Waze claimed that to impose complete prohibition on release of an approver from custody seemed unreasonable. \"To let a person languish in jail only because he chose to help the State in bringing the other offenders to justice, seems to be unreasonable. Under the guise of imposing complete prohibition against a person being released from custody defies logic and reasons. Possibly one can say, reasonable restrictions can be imposed,\" the plea claimed.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-notice-sachin-waze-bail-plea-bribery-case-cbi-9357820/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Sachin-Waze.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:31:21", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.448}

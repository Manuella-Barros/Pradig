I think she wants to have a few. At least two or three.\"\n\nWhen Ellen prodded Justin by asking, \"What are you waiting for,\" he responded about his wife, \"I think Hailey still has some things she wants to accomplish as a woman.

They were never married and broke up a few months after their son was born. While Justin's mother didn't have more children, the \"Sorry\" singer has four siblings from his father: sisters Jazmyn, Allie and Bay, and brother Jaxon.\n\nWhile Justin has been open about the ups and downs he experienced with his parents over the years, the Biebers seem to be a tight-knit group. The family has celebrated holidays together and spent time in Canada, which they've documented on social media.\n\nIn March 2024, Pattie celebrated Justin's 30th birthday with a post on Instagram.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie I've had a few good cries this week looking back through photos reminiscing. Time goes by so fast,\" she wrote. \"It's been amazing to see you become the man you are today @justinbieber. I'm so honored to be your mom. I love you more than you know. I can't wait to see the great things God has planned for you ahead. You ain't seen nothing yet!\"\n\nThe singer has also said that family comes first. In 2019, while updating fans about his struggle with mental health, he said he was taking a step back from music to focus on himself, his marriage and eventually \"be the father I want to be.\"\n\nFatherhood is now right around the corner for Justin, who is preparing to welcome his first child with wife Hailey Bieber. This baby will also make Jeremy and Pattie grandparents for the first time.\n\nFrom how they encouraged his singing career to how they've expanded their families, here's everything to know about Justin Bieber's parents.\n\nJustin's mother, Pattie, was born in 1975 in Ontario, and welcomed Justin when she was 18 years old. While Jeremy wasn't as active in Justin's upbringing when he was a child, Justin lived primarily with his mom, who told The New York Times she worked a number of low-paying office jobs to make ends meet.\n\n\"I grew up with not a lot of money,\" Justin told the outlet in 2009. \"We never owned a house. I want to buy my mom a house.\"\n\nAccording to Billboard, Pattie encouraged Justin's musical talent at a young age, entering him in talent shows and posting his performances on YouTube, which is how he ultimately got discovered.\n\nPattie has been by her son's side since the start of his fame, from Justin's initial visit to Atlanta to meet manager Scooter Braun to signing with a record label. She also appeared in Justin's 2011 documentary Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which chronicled the musician's rise to stardom.\n\n\"It's really fun watching him grow and transition,\" Pattie told MTV News in 2013. \"It's just been this crazy whirlwind, and I'm just along for the ride.\"\n\nJustin's dad, Jeremy Bieber, was also born in 1975 in Ontario. While he shares Justin with ex Pattie, he also is a father of four other children: He shares daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon with ex Erin Wagner, and daughter Bay with his wife Chelsey Rebelo, as well as Chelsey's daughter Allie from a previous relationship.\n\nWhile Justin's relationship with his father has experienced ups and downs over the years, the two have a strong bond. The singer told Billboard in 2015 that his father was \"not in a place where he could raise a kid\" when Justin was younger.\n\n\"He was immature. He left for like a year when I was about 4, went to British Columbia, came back on Father's Day,\" Justin recalled. \"I remember my mom said, 'If you're going to be here, you have to be here.' There's a misconception that he's this deadbeat dad, but he has been in my life since. I was with him on weekends and Wednesdays.\"\n\nIn February 2016, however, Justin told GQ that he was \"a lot closer to my dad than I am to my mom\" at the time.\n\nThe singer opened up about his relationship with Jeremy again in December 2017, sharing a photo of the two on Instagram and writing, \"I\ufe0f love continuing to get to know my father I\ufe0f love working through hard things to get to the good things.. relationships are worth fighting for especially with family!! Love you forever and always daddy!\"\n\nThe \"Peaches\" singer is \"honored\" to be Jeremy's son and praised his father in a 2022 post for Father's Day. \"Love you pops!\" he captioned a throwback photo. \"Happy Father's Day! So much to look forward to. Best is still ahead of us! Honored to be your son.\"\n\nChelsey Bieber (n\u00e9e Rebelo) is Justin's stepmom. After dating Jeremy for several years, the two got engaged on Feb. 19, 2016, in St. Barths.\n\nJustin celebrated his father's pending nuptials at an engagement party in Toronto a few months later. Justin reportedly performed at the private party and played piano. He later served as a groomsman at Jeremy and Chelsey's 2018 wedding.\n\nAnd just like Justin, Chelsey is a Toronto Maple Leafs fan, frequently sharing photos of herself attending games with Jeremy and wearing team garb.\n\nShe's also seen her stepson perform on tour. In March 2022, she shared a photo of Jeremy and their four children at one of Justin's shows. \"Let's gooooooo @justinbieber \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c,\" she captioned the shot.\n\nWhile Pattie has supported Justin's career, they were estranged for two years when Justin was in the press for poor public behavior.\n\nIn 2015, the pop star told Billboard that their relationship was \"pretty nonexisting.\" He explained, \"I was distant because I was ashamed. I never wanted my mom to be disappointed in me and I knew she was. We spent some time not talking, so it takes time to rebuild that trust. She's living in Hawaii now, so it's hard, but getting better. She's an amazing woman and I love her.\"\n\nThe mother-son duo reunited in January 2018 for a vacation together, and Pattie shared a photo of the two in an embrace with a sweet caption.\n\n\"I'm so proud of the amazing young man you are, and the young man you are becoming,\" she wrote. \"I admire your character and integrity. You are maturing beautifully and wise beyond your years.\"\n\nPattie also seemingly has a close relationship with Justin's wife, Hailey Bieber, whom he wed in September 2018. One day after Justin and Hailey secretly tied the knot, Pattie celebrated the couple by tweeting, \"Love is unconditional.\"\n\nIn May 2024, Justin and Hailey announced that they are currently expecting their first child together. \"WE ARE GONNA HAVE THE CUTEST GRAND-BABIES EVER!\" Pattie wrote below an Instagram post penned by Hailey's dad, Stephen Baldwin.\n\nAfter using \"babies,\" plural, Pattie had to clarify that Justin and her daughter-in-law are not expecting twins. \"No not twins lol I wish. I just mean in general. Hopefully they will have more than one eventually. They will make beautiful babies whenever they have them. One is enough for now,\" she wrote in a separate comment.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ever since, Hailey has continued to share her pregnancy journey on Instagram with her fans.\n\nHowever, her latest bump snaps for her Rhode brand have fans adamant she is dropping subtle clues as to the gender of their child, with the star already almost five months pregnant.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Gracie Abrams praises 'legend' Taylor Swift for putting out fire in apartment\n\nIn her most recent uploads, Hailey is seen showcasing her growing bump in a tight black outfit. Appearing to be on some kind of shopping spree, she took a selfie in front of a wardrobe of clothes while wearing a skintight black romper. She wore an oversized brown coat over the top and accessorised with black sunglasses.\n\nHer unique Rhode phone case - together with a little space for the Rhode peptide lip tints - is also seen in bright pink. And it is this subtle inclusion that fans believes hints at the gender of her unborn baby.\n\nRushing to the comments section after her upload, one user asked: \"Is it a girl with all this pink?\" Another seemingly agreed, commenting: \"it's a girl!\" Other followers simply gushed over the star's appearance, with many labelling her \"beautiful mama\".\n\nAt the weekend, their child's grandmother-to-be shared a loving tribute to her son, Justin, to mark Father's Day. Pattie Mallette posted a carousel of photos of Justin and his wife in honour of the special occasion.\n\nThe carousel showed snaps of Hailey's bump from their loving video reveal, as well as the couple kissing as Hailey showed off her baby bump.

To celebrate the occasion his mother took to Instagram on Sunday, June 16, to give him his own Father's Day tribute.\n\nHer post featured various images of Hailey and Justin with a caption: \"Happy Father's Day Justin.\"\n\n\"You've always wanted to be a dad ever since I can remember. You have so much love to give. You're gonna be the best daddy ever. You already are. LOVE YOU!!\"\n\nMallette was quick to announce her excitement for the couple after they announced they were expecting. \"BABY BIEBER IS ON THE WAY!! I'm gonna be a GRANDMA!! CONGRATULATIONS @justinbieber and @haileybieber !! My heart is so full. What an exciting new adventure. Love you so much!\" she captioned a video of herself on Instagram at the time.\n\n\"So I have been waiting for this day,\" the 49-year-old admitted in the video. \"And now that they have shared it, I can finally celebrate with y'all. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be a grandma! Oh my goodness.\"\n\nShe added: \"Justin and Hailey, you are gonna be the best parents ever, and I am so excited. Oh my goodness. Praise God.\"\n\nThe couple first announced they were pregnant on Instagram while sharing photos from their private vow renewal ceremony in Hawaii as Hailey was seen wearing a white lace dress with her husband dressed in black. The caption only featured the two of them tagging each other.\n\nDespite the couple never formally announcing the gender of their child, some fans have speculated that Hailey subtly did. Last month the Rhode Skin founder took to Instagram to share a photo dump highlighting random activities she's been up to.\n\n\"Little cherry blossoms on my nails little cherry blossom in my belly,\" she captioned the post.\n\nThis led to many fans assuming that \"cherry blossom\" meant that she would be having a girl and some of the commenters even suggested that Blossom or Cherry would be sweet name ideas for the child.\n\n\"Baby Bieber is a girl,\" one comment read, while another agreed, writing, \"A GIRL CONFIRMED AHHHHHH.\"\n\nOther commenters phrased it as a question, being unsure whether or not Bieber was confirming if she was pregnant with a girl.\n\n\"Is it a girl? are you going to name her blossom ? Or a flower name ?\" one commenter asked.\n\n\"ITS A GIRLLLLL?\" another commenter questioned.\n\nThroughout the couple's marriage, they've been open about wanting to be parents as Justin admitted on The Ellen Show back in 2020 that he wanted to have \"a tribe.\"\n\n\"I'd love to have myself a little tribe,\" he told her at the time. \"I am going to have as many as Hailey is wishing to push out.\"\n\nHailey also mentioned Justin's aspirations to be a father. \"We were having pillow talk conversations, with him telling me my biggest goal in life is to have a healthy family,\" she explained on a 2021 episode of In Good Faith with Chelsea & Judah Smith.\n\n\"We always wanted to be married young and have a young family and have kids young.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattie_Mallette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pattie Mallette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cherry blossom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blossom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Closed_Captioning", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Closed Captioning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/10/16/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658875", "eventUri": "eng-9658875", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 269, "textEnd": 276}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The lovebirds met when they were just teenagers and at the cusp of their respective careers. Since they were romantically involved with different people, they remained good friends.\n\nHowever, several years after their previous relationships fell apart, they remembered each other. In 2018 after many date nights, late-night rendezvous, and clandestine meetings, they knew they were \"the one\" for each other. On September 13, 2018, the duo got married at a courthouse. A year after their courtroom wedding, they tied the knot on September 30, 2019, in South Carolina. Hailey and Justin have been married for five years, and things seem to be blissful. Or are they?\n\nAs per The Sun, Hailey recently spent a day out with her best friend Kendall Jenner. Hailey reportedly spent the day concocting some uniquely made pots at Jenner's pottery studio in Los Angeles. The supermodel took to her Instagram stories to share a few glimpses of their time.\n\nThe duo were seen giggling away, as Hailey tried her best to delicately give shape to what appeared to be a vase. With her hair open, Hailey flaunted some chunky minimalistic gold earrings.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, there was one more major piece of bling missing - her wedding ring! Hailey seemed to have removed her dazzling ring given to her the day she and her husband exchanged their vows. Perhaps Hailey removed the expensive ring to avoid it getting dirty. Or could it be that this is a subtle hint of her marriage being on the rocks?\n\nRecently, the Biebers have been abuzz with rumors concerning their relationship turning sour. This ringless finger has only further fueled such whispers and it may even continue until either of them comment on the matter. However, they've both refrained from commenting on their current relationship status. Whether or not there's truth in the rumors remains to be seen.\n\nCombing back to the Instagram Story, the duo was seen chuckling away at the incomplete and slightly deformed vase that seemed hilarious. They were seen sitting amid a rustic atmosphere with red stone flooring and a lovely view of the serene outdoors through the enchanting white-framed entrance.\n\nTo commemorate their little achievement, Jenner wrote in the caption of her stories, \"Friendship sealed.\" While one friendship appears to be in full bloom with no signs of separation, the jury's still out about Hailey's romantic life with Justin.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(jewellery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring (jewellery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wedding ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/671266/uploads/33ddc420-bd02-11ee-abdb-79dec45c14ad_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658875", "eventUri": "eng-9658875", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-13", "textStart": 511, "textEnd": 529}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-30", "textStart": 628, "textEnd": 646}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

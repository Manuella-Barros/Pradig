{"id": 231296106, "title": "&#8216;Queenie&#8217; Creator Hopes to Make Noise With Hulu Series", "text": "Hulu\u2019s new drama series Queenie begins with its protagonist, Queenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown), in stirrups \u2014 and in pain \u2014 at a visit to her OBGYN, during which a technician tells her in response to her audible discomfort, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re fine, strong girl like you,\u201d before asking, \u201cHow many sexual partners do you have?\u201d The scene sets audience expectations for the coming-of-age story based on Candice Carty-Williams\u2019 2019 novel of the same name, about a 25-year-old British-Jamaican girl in South London running from abandonment issues spawned by her estranged relationship with her mother \u2014 which seem to catch up to her through every man whose attention she clamors for, be it her boyfriend Tom (Jon Pointing) or the sexual suitors she entertains after signing up for a dating app when he asks for a \u201cclean break.\u201d \u201cAuthenticity is really important to me,\u201d Carty-Williams said at a special press screening of the series in London, which The Hollywood Reporter attended. \u201cWhen you see something on screen that doesn\u2019t represent you, you really feel it. I had to make sure that when I was watching it \u2014 because I was in the edit for like nine months \u2014 that everything was working. You would feel when something didn\u2019t feel right or something didn\u2019t look right; it didn\u2019t look like us.\u201d Those moments sometimes required having difficult conversations, said creator Carty-Williams, also an executive producer and showrunner. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it when you want to see yourself properly represented, and also, you have these really beautiful, amazing people inside and out [that you\u2019re working with],\u201d she added in reference to the show\u2019s cast, which includes Queenie\u2019s tell-it-like-it-is friend Kyazike, played by British singer-songwriter Bellah, and her cousin Frank (Samuel Adewunmi). Joseph Marcell (The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) portrays Queenie\u2019s grandad Wilfred. \u201cYou also want to make them proud of what they\u2019ve done, too. It\u2019s not just me anymore, it\u2019s a whole family of us.\u201d Queenie\u2019s missteps may prove cringe for older audiences far removed from their own quarter-life crises as they watch the young social media assistant suffer through panic attacks and push those closest to her away, rather than let them in on her struggles. But for newcomer Brown, 28, portraying a young woman simply trying to figure life out was liberating. \u201cI read the book throughout the audition process. But when I got the part, I read it again in full, and I remember seeing Candice and being like, \u2018Did we know each other in a past life?\u2019\u201d Brown recalled during a private media panel. \u201cShe was like, \u2018What?\u2019 And said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know that other people felt like this.\u2019 And she told me, \u2018You\u2019re never the only one.\u2019 \u201c[Queenie] gave me a sense of fellowship, in a manner of speaking, and I think through that it was quite cathartic,\u201d Brown added. \u201cIt helped me let go of things that maybe I hadn\u2019t let go of as well as I thought I had. It made me recall things and let them go easier. I think sometimes we don\u2019t want to think about something because it\u2019s like, \u2018oh, if I bring it close to me again, I\u2019m going to hold it.\u2019 And after that it was like, \u2018no I can.\u2019 I can bring it as close as I need it and I can still free it.\u201d Below, Carty-Williams, Brown and Bellah chat with THR about adapting Queenie for television and what it means to put South London on the map in this series. *** There was a publisher bidding war over your novel in 2017. Was it the same when it came to the TV adaptation? How did this project land at Hulu? CANDICE CARTY-WILLIAMS I saw maybe 15 production companies in total who wanted to work with me on the show. Eventually, we went with Lionsgate because, you know, the name. And then Channel 4 got in touch with me and they were like, \u201cLook, we remember your novel when it was going around, we want to work on it,\u201d and I started developing it with them around 2017, 2018. So, before the novel even came out, we were already working on it. And then Tara Duncan from Onyx had basically been stalking me for a while (laughs) and she came in to give an amazing pitch and I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously gonna be Onyx.\u201d I feel super supported and Tara kind of knew the project from the beginning. She has been so instrumental in making it what it should be all the way. How true is the series to the novel? Were there any key changes that you made in the adaptation? CARTY-WILLIAMS Lots of things came out for time, obviously, because a novel\u2019s a hundred thousand words and a TV show is eight 23-minute episodes, so you\u2019ve got to be snappy. We took some of the bigger things out but we kept in it the heart of who Queenie is and who her friends and family are. Some of the men, some of the sticky situations, we kept in because they were fun. But some stuff we had to remix a little bit. There\u2019s a day where Kyazike tells a story for half of a chapter, and in the TV show, we were like: we don\u2019t have the time for that. So, we just had Kyazike [talking] in the van on the way to moving Queenie [into her new apartment]. We\u2019re always keeping it moving. What was it like for you being a showrunner for the first time, and how important was it for you to be in that role? CARTY-WILLIAMS I wasn\u2019t actually meant to showrun it. I was meant to write a couple of episodes and then be like, \u201cCool, thanks everyone, see you later.\u201d But you end up being like, \u201cNo I need to be there.\u201d Just with writing episodes, you then re-write episodes, and then you\u2019re writing on set and talking to people, so you\u2019re changing things. I would say, sort of from the beginning up until the very end \u2014 we left the edit two months ago \u2014 for the last year, it\u2019s been Queenie every minute of every day. It\u2019s good because it\u2019s my vision, ultimately, and it\u2019s amazing being close to everyone. I also like getting the best out of them, but also, I want to be a support, and it was important for me to be there when we were talking about things that were really challenging. I didn\u2019t just want to leave it to someone else. I wanted to be able to have difficult conversations. It was a lot, and it was all-consuming, but it was worth it. Dionne and Bellah, talk about landing your roles. DIONNE BROWN It was an extensive audition process, which I loved. I feel like a lot of actors are really averse to that kind of audition process, but I really like it. I like being in the room, and I like going into the room again and again and again and getting closer to something. I obviously like getting it as well (laughs). I don\u2019t want to just get close and then not get it. But it was different every single time. We did a chemistry read, and then we did another chemistry read after our tapes and the rest is history. BELLAH The casting director, Aisha [Bywaters], saw me promoting my music on a news show, ITV, and she reached out to my team. I was a bit apprehensive, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d and she said that I was charming so that was that (laughs). I did quite a few auditions and I was traveling a lot, so a lot of my auditions were on Zoom. I grew up doing musical theatre, so I thought when you audition for things, you kind of just do it, cross your fingers, hope for the best, but you move on with your life because you\u2019re not banking on it. They just kept calling me, and I was like, \u201cYou guys like me.\u201d I found out [that I got it] when I was in America and I was really angry at my manager because he knew before I did and saw me eat all the food that I was eating and just said, \u201cYeah man, you got the role,\u201d going back. I was like, \u201cYou hate me.\u201d But it was fun and amazing. I was very excited. Candice, what was it about Bellah and Dionne that let you know they were right for their respective parts? CARTY-WILLIAMS I\u2019d seen Dionne in another audition for my other show, Champion, and I was like, there\u2019s something quite Queenie about her, so we\u2019re going to keep her for that, and if she comes back to me, then it means that she\u2019s going to be Queenie. Dionne was asking a lot of questions about the role, and I was like, she\u2019s very in her head, and Queenie is as in her head as this. So, I thought these two people, they\u2019re going to work. Bellah, I\u2019ve been a fan of her music for a really long time. When the casting director said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to call in Bellah,\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, great.\u201d In the chemistry reads, together, they were really, really strong. There was a real connection of sisterhood and of being quite different people, but bringing one tone to things. Also, Bellah\u2019s improvisation was making everyone laugh. I was like, we\u2019re gonna need that offset. Black American audiences routinely have conversations about representation and wanting to see themselves in stories like this. How significant is a series like this for Black British audiences? CARTY-WILLIAMS I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. Obviously, I\u2019ve watched Insecure, which is probably the closest thing to it in the world of TV. I\u2019m a huge fan of Insecure, huge fan of Issa Rae, and we need something for ourselves. Growing up, our representation, a lot of it was American, and we\u2019re not American. We\u2019re different in so many ways. I never wanted the character to be strong or sassy or loud. I wanted her to be this person who actually had a lot of vulnerability and a lot of pain and a lot of trauma and we would work through it with her and see what that means and what that does to a person in the British context because that is the key. Are there nuances to the Black British experience that you feel American audiences need to understand or be open to in terms of your characters\u2019 journeys? BELLAH I always say it, but a lot of us are diaspora kids. This is based on a Jamaican woman\u2019s journey, and that has nuance to it. I\u2019m Nigerian in real life, I have nuance to the way I do things, the way I say things. My slang is informed by Jamaican language, but also my English is not fantastic \u2014 well, my English is fantastic, but when I choose to not use correct English, it\u2019s informed by the Nigerian immigrants around me, do you know what I mean? So, it\u2019s language, it\u2019s food, it\u2019s culture, it\u2019s music, it\u2019s everything. It\u2019s different, but it\u2019s still very similar. It\u2019s still a Black experience, because the moment we came here, we were Black. We stopped being Jamaican, stopped being Nigerian. So, it\u2019s still that but it\u2019s just a new perspective, a fresh perspective. When the novel came out it was marketed as a Black Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary, and you said that\u2019s not actually what this is. What has been important to you about the way this series gets marketed to audiences? CARTY-WILLIAMS I think it\u2019s important that money is spent, and I don\u2019t say that flippantly. I think with the whole Black Bridget Jones thing, that\u2019s about the scale of things. I never wanted Queenie to be a quiet publication, I never wanted it to just kind of come out and then be in the Black section on bookshelves. I wanted it to be in loads of people\u2019s houses of every single background. I wanted people to understand her story, to read it, to talk about it, and it\u2019s been amazing to go around the world and people will be like, \u201cOh, you wrote that book?\u201d I\u2019ve seen my book in the maddest places. I went to Mexico City not long ago and I was in this Black-owned art gallery, and in their special reading room there was a copy of Queenie and I was like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d It\u2019s a weird thing, but also, it\u2019s cool. Like, let her story be universal. And in the way of marketing, let everyone watch this. Let everyone take it in and let everyone understand who she is and what she\u2019s about. It\u2019s really great for me to put South London on the map in that way.

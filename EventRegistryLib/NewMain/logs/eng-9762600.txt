Rahul ji must answer - the idea of Khalistan that caused the assassination of PM Indira ji is being hailed !! Why does Congress always bat for separatists and terrorists? Yakub, Afzal, 26/11 jihadis, now K terrorists?\" he wrote on his social media handle X.\n\nUnion minister Giriraj Singh said Congress MP Channi's remarks made inside Parliament were \"unfortunate\". \"The Khalistani who assassinated Indira Gandhi has received open support from Channi today, which means the Congress is siding with the Khalistanis. This is an attack on the integrity of India...what can I say, I will say action should be taken,\" he said, PTI reported.\n\nMeantime, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma called for the Congress to remove Channi from their party. \"Today, Channi, who doesn't even have the status of a 'chavanni' (a quarter-rupee coin), is speaking in support of terrorists and glorifying them. He is working at the behest of anti-national elements from Canada,\" he said, PTI reported.\n\n\"The Congress should expel him, and if Congress doesn't take action against him, it means that somewhere Congress is in cahoots with these anti-social and anti-national elements,\" he also said.\n\nChanni accused the central government of imposing an \"undeclared emergency\" in the country, leading to a heated discussion with the Union Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries, Ravneet Singh Bittu during a Lok Sabha debate, which resulted in a brief adjournment.\n\nThe Lok Sabha session was adjourned for 30 minutes due to a verbal clash between Channi and Ravneet Singh Bittu over personal remarks, until 2 pm.\n\nDuring the Union Budget debate, Channi criticised the BJP government for labelling farmers as Khalistanis and neglecting Punjab in this year's budget. He stated \"It's not a budget to save the country, it's just to save their government. They haven't addressed the floods in Punjab, haven't raised wages, and have ignored Punjab in this budget. Jalandhar was declared a smart city, but it still has dirty water and a significant drug problem.\"\n\nChanni mentioned the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, sparking a war of words with Bittu, who recently left Congress for the BJP. Bittu countered by making personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, causing an uproar.\n\nIn the heated exchange, Channi said, \"Your grandfather became a martyr the day you left Congress.\" Bittu retorted, \"My grandfather sacrificed for the country, not for Congress,\" and called Channi \"the most corrupt person in Punjab.\"", "source": {"uri":

This is an attack on the integrity of India...what can I say, I will say action should be taken,\" he told PTI videos.\n\nBJP MP Dinesh Sharma demanded the expulsion of Channi by Congress.\n\n\"Today, Channi, who doesn't even have the status of a 'chavanni' (a quarter-rupee coin), is speaking in support of terrorists and glorifying them. He is working at the behest of anti-national elements from Canada,\" he told PTI Videos.\n\n\"The Congress should expel him, and if Congress doesn't take action against him, it means that somewhere Congress is in cahoots with these anti-social and anti-national elements,\" he said.\n\nChanni blamed the central government for an \"undeclared emergency\" in the country even as a heated exchange with BJP's Ravneet Singh Bittu during a debate in the Lok Sabha led to a brief adjournment in the proceedings.\n\nDuring a debate on the Union Budget in the Lower House, Channi also held the BJP government responsible for farmers being termed Khalistanis. He added that his home state Punjab was ignored in this year's budget.\n\nChanni said, \"It's not a budget to save the country, it's just to save their government. They haven't addressed the floods in Punjab, haven't raised wages, and have ignored Punjab in this budget. Jalandhar was declared a smart city, but it still has dirty water and a significant drug problem.\"\n\nThe Lok Sabha was adjourned for 30 minutes amid a verbal spat between the former Punjab chief minister and the Union Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries Ravneet Singh Bittu over certain personal remarks till 2 pm.\n\nChanni referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. This led to a war of words between Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, and Channi.\n\nBittu countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nIn a heated exchange, Channi told Bittu, \"Your grandfather became a martyr, the day you left Congress.\" To which, the BJP leader retorted, \"My grandfather sacrificed for the country, not for Congress.\" He also called Channi \"the most corrupt person in Punjab\".\n\nDuring his address to the Lok Sabha, Channi accused the government of creating conditions similar to an emergency.\n\nHe listed the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala case, action against opposition leaders by central agencies, and alleged mistreatment of farmers, women athletes, and journalists as evidence of this.\n\nThe Congress leader also pointed to the long-standing unrest in Manipur and the Hathras gang rape case, in which he said the victim's cremation was rushed.\n\n\"The country is facing an undeclared emergency and the BJP is responsible,\" Channi said.\n\n\"Farmers are called Khalistani when they make demands, which aren't fulfilled. This is also an emergency,\" he added.\n\nThe central government, he said, has exhausted its ideas and sincerity after ten years in power, pointing to the absence of the prime minister and the finance minister during \"such an important discussion\".\n\n\"Their seats are empty. They need to explain the budget, but no one is here. This is your sincerity?\" he asked.\n\nChanni said, \"I come from a poor family and got my education thanks to the Congress government. The BJP's worst move in 2014 was cutting scholarships for minorities and Dalit children.\"\n\nSlamming the depreciation of the rupee, Channi claimed, \"The dollar's value increased by Rs 25 in ten years, whereas during (ex-PM) Manmohan Singh's time, it only increased by Rs 13 in ten years. Sometimes, it feels like there's a competition between the rupee and the government to see which falls faster.\"\n\nThe Lok Sabha was adjourned twice in the post-lunch period as a war of words broke out between the treasury and opposition benches, triggered by Channi's spat with Bittu.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [],

Moments later, Bittu released a video message and accused the former of misleading and misguiding the nation.\n\nRavneet Singh Bittu, the Union Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries, said that the former Punjab chief minister was utterly wrong in claiming that the farmers were booked under NSA. He termed it an outrageous ploy to demean and mock the farmers.\n\n\"Today, a former Chief Minister (referring to Channi) behaved in an anti-national manner and misled the world through the Lok Sabha.

They are only concerned with staying in power. The BJP is responsible for a financial emergency in the country. They only talk about past Emergencies, but today, there is an undeclared Emergency,\" Channi said.\n\nHe also advocated for Amritpal Singh, a pro-Khalistan leader and MP from the Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency, who has been imprisoned under the NSA.\n\nHe argued: \"Twenty lakh people elected an MP, and he (Amritpal Singh) is being imprisoned under the NSA.

They haven't addressed the floods in Punjab, haven't raised wages, and have ignored Punjab in this budget. Jalandhar was declared a smart city, but it still has dirty water and a significant drug problem.\" The Lok Sabha was adjourned for 30 minutes amid a verbal spat between the former Punjab chief minister and the Union Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries Ravneet Singh Bittu over certain personal remarks till 2 pm.\n\nChanni referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. This led to a war of words between Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, and Channi.\n\nBittu countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nIn a heated exchange, Channi told Bittu, \"Your grandfather became a martyr, the day you left Congress.\" To which, the BJP leader retorted, \"My grandfather sacrificed for the country, not for Congress.\" He also called Channi \"the most corrupt person in Punjab\".\n\nDuring his address to the Lok Sabha, Channi accused the government of creating conditions similar to an emergency.\n\nHe listed the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala case, action against opposition leaders by central agencies, and alleged mistreatment of farmers, women athletes, and journalists as evidence of this.\n\nThe Congress leader also pointed to the long-standing unrest in Manipur and the Hathras gang rape case, in which he said the victim's cremation was rushed.\n\n\"The country is facing an undeclared emergency and the BJP is responsible,\" Channi said.\n\n\"Farmers are called Khalistani when they make demands, which aren't fulfilled.

Sometimes, it feels like there's a competition between the rupee and the government to see which falls faster.\" The Lok Sabha was adjourned twice in the post-lunch period as a war of words broke out between the treasury and opposition benches, triggered by Channi's spat with Bittu.

He said that the NSA has been slapped on farmers. But who has it been slapped on - on those who wanted to break the country and Punjab? He said that the NSA has been invoked against farmers and this is incorrect. An ex-CM has spoken about breaking the country and Punjab. Congress and Rahul Gandhi were sitting before him and making him say it. When we told him to bring evidence to the Floor of the House, he went on backfoot and had no reply.

He said that there was no difference between the British Raj and the present PM Modi-led government \"except the skin colour\". He also slammed the government for its \"dictatorial attitude\".\n\nResponding to Channi's remarks, Bittu stood up to speak, saying he must answer his former party colleague.\n\n\"I have to respond because he took the name of my grandfather. My grandfather did not lay down his life for a party but for the country,\" he stated.\n\nHe further said that he would change his name if Channi could prove that he was poor, alleging that the Congress MP has the most powerful resources and most money in Punjab to date.\n\nThe BJP leader also claimed that the former Punjab CM was an accused in a sexual harassment case.\n\nIn response to Channi's \"skin colour\" comment, Bittu replied saying, that his remarks suggested he was referring to senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi. He also asked the grand old party to prove which country she came to India from.\n\nFollowing this, chaos ensued in the Lok Sabha with Punjab Congress MPs storming into the well and challenging Bittu to a fight.\n\n\"Himmat hai toh aaja (Come if you dare),\" a Congress lawmaker said.\n\nWhen Bittu tried to rush into the well, he was stopped by Union Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who asked him to calm down.\n\nBittu switched to BJP ahead of the April-June Lok Sabha polls. The former three-time Congress MP contested on a BJP ticket from the Ludhiana Lok Sabha seat. However, he lost to Congress's Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.\n\nBittu was then inducted into PM Modi's council of ministers as an MoS.\n\nIn a separate row, Channi also flagged concerns over the incarceration of 'Waris Punjab De' Chief and Khadoor Sahib MP, Amtripal Singh.\n\nCriticising the Centre over \"undeclared Emergency,\" the Congress MP said: \"They speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?...This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.\"\n\nFollowing these remarks, BJP leader Giriraj Singh demanded clarification from Congress's top leadership, saying that it is \"dangerous for India\" that the party is \"supporting Khalistan\".\n\nMeanwhile, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann was quick to distance himself from Channi's statement.\n\n\"I am not concerned for what Channi says. I am more concerned for Punjab's law and order,\" he said.\n\nBJP MP Dinesh Sharma also reacted to Channi's statement saying, \"...A sense of terrorist-sympathiser has awoken inside Channi. He has the blessings of Congress. This is his desire for foreign funds, especially from Canada, given for terrorist activities...Action should be taken.\"\n\nBJP national spokesperson RP Singh lashed out at Congress over the statement by the Congress MP saying that it is the \"DNA of Congress that is coming out. It was Congress who raised Bhindranwale and divided Punjab through him and won elections later. Today, they are standing with Amritpal.\"\n\nAlleging that the party Channi was trying to support someone who \"tries to divide the nation\", he added: \"Since the election is going to be held in Punjab in 2027 and he (Charanjit Singh Channi) knows that they are going to lose the elections and hence they are supporting someone who tries to divide the nation. But what else he can do, this is his party line. \"\n\nHe also asked Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge to clarify the party's stand on whether or not it stands with someone trying to divide the country.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beant_Singh_(politician)", "type": "person",

He added that his home state Punjab was ignored in this year's budget.\n\nChanni said, \"It's not a budget to save the country, it's just to save their government. They haven't addressed the floods in Punjab, haven't raised wages, and have ignored Punjab in this budget. Jalandhar was declared a smart city, but it still has dirty water and a significant drug problem.\" The Lok Sabha was adjourned for 30 minutes amid a verbal spat between the former Punjab chief minister and the Union Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries Ravneet Singh Bittu over certain personal remarks.\n\nChanni referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. This led to a war of words between Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, and Channi.\n\nBittu countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nIn a heated exchange, Channi told Bittu, \"Your grandfather became a martyr, the day you left Congress.\" To which, the BJP leader retorted, \"My grandfather sacrificed for the country, not for Congress.\" He also called Channi \"the most corrupt person in Punjab\".\n\nThe session was adjourned for 30 minutes till 2 pm.\n\nDuring his address to the Lok Sabha, Channi accused the government of creating conditions similar to an emergency.\n\nHe listed the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala case, action against opposition leaders by central agencies, and alleged mistreatment of farmers, women athletes, and journalists as evidence of this.\n\nThe Congress leader also pointed to the long-standing unrest in Manipur and the Hathras gang rape case, in which he said the victim's cremation was rushed.\n\n\"The country is facing an undeclared emergency and the BJP is responsible,\" Channi said.\n\n\"Farmers are called Khalistani when they make demands, which aren't fulfilled. This is also an emergency,\" he added.\n\nThe central government, he said, has exhausted its ideas and sincerity after ten years in power, pointing to the absence of the prime minister and the finance minister during \"such an important discussion\".\n\n\"Their seats are empty. They need to explain the budget, but no one is here. This is your sincerity?\" he asked.\n\nChanni said, \"I come from a poor family and got my education thanks to the Congress government. The BJP's worst move in 2014 was cutting scholarships for minorities and Dalit children.\" Slamming the depreciation of the rupee, Channi claimed, \"The dollar's value increased by Rs 25 in ten years, whereas during (ex-PM) Manmohan Singh's time, it only increased by Rs 13 in ten years. Sometimes, it feels like there's a competition between the rupee and the government to see which falls faster.\" He also attacked rising fuel prices and the privatisation of airports in his address.\n\n\"I was welcomed at the airport by someone who said they were from Adani, as they had taken over the airport for 50 years. Even on the plane, I asked if it had been sold. Seven airports have been given to Adani,\" he claimed.\n\nChanni contrasted his son's \"modest wedding\" at a gurdwara with PM Modi \"attending a 1000-crore wedding\".\n\n\"There is no difference between them and the British except for the colour (of their skin),\" he said.

He said that the NSA has been slapped on farmers. But who has it been actually slapped on - on those who wanted to break the country and Punjab. He said that NSA has been invoked against farmers and this is absolutely incorrect.\"\n\n\"An ex-CM has spoken about breaking the country and Punjab. Congress and Rahul Gandhi were sitting before him and making him say it. When we told him to bring evidence to the Floor of the House, he went on backfoot and had no reply. Congress party and the entire INDI Alliance are ashamed due to him,\" Ravneet Singh Bittu added.\n\nCongress Lok Sabha MP and former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi alleged that there is \"undeclared emergency\" under BJP-led government's rule and noted that \"free speech\" of the Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh who is in jail is being curbed by invoking the National Security Act against him.\n\nSpeaking during the debate on the Budget 2024, Charanjit Singh Channi said, \"They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?...This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.\"\n\nHe made a scathing attack at the BJP led-NDA government and alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family.\n\nChanni said, \"Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today's undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family.\"\n\nAFter coming out of the Parliament,Charanjit Singh Channi said, \"I spoke about the poor, the farmers that how promise on MSP to farmers is not being delivered. I spoke about the entire Budget, about the situation in the country and the manner in which the country is sinking financially.\"\n\nOn Amritpal Singh, he says, \"I said inside (the House).\"\n\nElaborating about the issues which are evident and due to which he is calling an \"imposition of undeclared emergency\" in the country, Charanjit Singh Channi said, \"It is also an emergency when central agencies work against opposition leaders. It is also an emergency when farmers are declared as Khalistani when they ask for their rights. A concrete barricading has been created to stop them so they cannot arrive in Delhi. This is also an emergency. It is also an emergency that Manipur which has been constantly burning for the last 1.5-2 years is left in the plight condition. It is also an emergency that students who have been protesting for their rights have been declared anti-nationalists?\"\n\nTaking a jibe at Channi, Union Minister and BJP MP Giriraj Singh said that the person who assassinated former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a Khalistani and the Congress is supporting the assassin.\n\n\"On Channi's statement, I would only say that Indira Gandhi's assassin was a Khalistani and Congress is supporting Khalistani. Waah re Congress, Jai Channi. This is an attack on India's sovereignty. Action should be taken on this...Congress ka haath, Khalistanion ke saath,\" Giriraj said.\n\nSlamming Channi for his remarks of an \"undeclared emergency\", Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, asked him whether he know what an emergency actually is and slammed him for advocating for Amritpal Singh.\n\nUnion Minister Pralhad Joshi said, \"This issue is in court. Serious allegations are against him (Amritpal Singh). It's not right to talk about it in the Parliament. It's before the people, what Congress has done. He (Charanjit Singh Channi) was not there during the Emergency, so he didn't know what was the condition then. Today, they keep commenting over the PM, was it possible to make such comments over Indira Gandhi, during the Emergency?\"\n\nBJP leader RP Singh questioned Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge if he wanted to support the members who wants to divide the nation.\n\nRP Singh said, \"This is the same Congress that nurtured Bhindranwale and divided Punjab to win the elections. Today, they are supporting Amritpal Singh. If a person has murdered someone, shouldn't he be jailed? This is only for the vote bank, as elections are approaching in Punjab. Rahul Gandhi and Amritpal Singh have said India is a \"union of states\", which means they both have the same thinking. Kharge Ji needs to answer if his party is standing with the members who want to divide the nation.\"\n\nBJP MP Brijmohan Agrawal also attacked Charanjit Singh Channi for his remarks and said, \"Those who do not want the country's progress, those who want to protect people who create terror in the country - he has come to the Parliament for country's development, he has taken an oath of the Constitution. So, those who advocate such people do not work in national interest and this is highly condemnable.\"\n\nReacting to Channi's statement, Punjab Congress chief and MP Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said, \"I have not heard the complete statement but I would like to say that due facilities as per the Constitution should be provided to every elected individual (MP) - be it me, or Amritpal or anyone else. Nobody has the right to violate laws - be it anybody. So, I have been saying from the first day that there should be no injustice to anyone as per the Constitution - be it anyone.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

Slamming Channi for his remarks of an \"undeclared emergency,\" Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, asked him whether he know what an emergency actually is and slammed him for advocating for Amritpal Singh.\n\nUnion Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu accused the former Punjab CM of behaving like a traitor.\n\nUnion Minister Pralhad Joshi said, \"This issue is in court. Serious allegations are against him (Amritpal Singh). It's not right to talk about it in the Parliament. It's before the people, what Congress has done. He (Charanjit Singh Channi) was not there during the Emergency, so he didn't know what was the condition then. Today, they keep commenting over the PM, was it possible to make such comments over Indira Gandhi, during the Emergency?\"\n\nBJP leader RP Singh asked Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge if he wanted to support the members who wanted to divide the nation.\n\nRP Singh said, \"This is the same Congress that nurtured Bhindranwale and divided Punjab to win the elections. Today, they are supporting Amritpal Singh. If a person has murdered someone, shouldn't he be jailed? This is only for the vote bank, as elections are approaching in Punjab.

This too is an Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars by slapping NSA...freedom of speech...he is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is an Emergency,\" Channi said.\n\nRecounting instances of \"undeclared Emergency\" in the country, the Congress MP said: \"Farmers are called Khalistanis when they put forward their demands. Manipur has been burning for the past 1.5 years. Journalists are put behind bars for asking questions.\"\n\nChanni's comments sparked an uproar in the house, with the BJP demanding answers from the Congress and Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe Congress later distanced itself from Channi's comments. Senior leader Jairam Ramesh posted on X that Channi's views were his own and \"do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress\".\n\nAmritpal Singh had successfully contested the Lok Sabha polls as an Independent while lodged in a prison in Assam's Dibrugarh, under the NSA. He won from Punjab's Khadoor Sahib, defeating Kulbir Singh Zira of the Congress by nearly two lakh votes.\n\nThe Sikh radical, who is chief of the pro-Sikh separatist organisation Waris Punjab De, was charged under the NSA last year. The police had first attempted to crack down on Amritpal and his associates in Punjab in March 2023, arresting hundreds of his supporters. Amritpal had managed to escape at the time, but was later arrested in April the same year. His election affidavit stated that he has 12 criminal cases registered against him.\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint, BJP national spokesperson R.P. Singh said, \"They are targeting 2027 elections and targeting Panthic votes and by supporting him they are trying to get radical votes. This shows Congress supports terrorists. This is not the first time they have done this. Amritpal is behind the bars for dividing the country and why shouldn't NSA be imposed on him? He may win the election but he will have to pay for his wrongdoings.\"\n\nAlso read: Akhilesh, Thirumavalavan, Sanjay Raut -- INDIA bloc leaders join Jagan's protest against TDP in Delhi\n\nWhile concluding his speech, Channi targeted Union Minister of State Ravneet Bittu, who lost from Ludhiana in the the Lok Sabha elections. Before polls, Bittu had defected from the Congress to the BJP.\n\nAttacking the BJP, Channi said there is no difference between the party and the East India Company. The only difference between them is of colour ('woh gore the'), and on this, Bittu pointed his finger at Channi.\n\nChanni went on to say that Bittu's grandfather, former chief minister Beant Singh -- who was assassinated in 1995 -- was martyred, but \"did not die on that day, he died on the day you left the Congress\" -- referring to Bittu's defection to the BJP.\n\nSandhya Rai, then sitting in the Speaker's chair, tried to stop Channi from making further remarks. Channi then said Bittu was interrupting and troubling him.\n\nIn response, Bittu said his grandfather had sacrificed his life for the country, not for the Congress.\n\nAfter the House reassembled, Channi once again said that the NSA was imposed on farmers, which led to another uproar in Parliament.\n\nLater, Bittu issued a statement criticising Channi: \"A former CM is behaving like a traitor and misleading the entire country through the House.\"\n\nUnion Minister Giriraj Singh said what happened in the House was unfortunate. \"Those Khalistanis who killed Indira Gandhi, today Channi supported them openly.

This led to a war of words between Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, and Channi.\n\nBittu countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nIn the heated exchange, Channi told Bittu, \"Your grandfather became a martyr, the day you left Congress.\" To which, the BJP leader retorted, \"My grandfather sacrificed for the country, not for Congress.\" He also called Channi \"the most corrupt person in Punjab\".\n\nThe session was adjourned for 30 minutes till 2pm.\n\nDuring his address to the Lok Sabha, Channi accused the government of creating conditions similar to an emergency.\n\nHe listed the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala case, action against opposition leaders by central agencies, and alleged mistreatment of farmers, women athletes, and journalists as evidence of this.\n\nThe Congress leader also pointed to the long-standing unrest in Manipur and the Hathras gang rape case, in which he said the victim's cremation was rushed.\n\n\"The country is facing an undeclared emergency and the BJP is responsible,\" Channi said.\n\n\"Farmers are called Khalistani when they make demands, which aren't fulfilled.

treasury and opposition benches, triggered by Congress MP Charanjit Singh Channi's spat with the BJP's Ravneet Singh Bittu.\n\nParticipating in a debate on the Union Budget, Channi referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.\n\nThis led to a war of words between Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, and Channi.\n\nBittu, the Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries, countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nBJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes till 2 pm.\n\nWhen the House reconvened, Defence Minister and Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha Rajnath Singh urged the speaker to remove any unparliamentary references and continue with the debate.\n\nSpeaker Om Birla also directed the treasury and the opposition members to maintain the dignity of the House, adding that ministers especially should not break the rules.\n\nChanni then proceeded to conclude his speech.\n\nHe mentioned the meeting of Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi with some farmer leaders on Wednesday, adding that they had also sought time to meet the prime minister.\n\nRahul Gandhi assures farm leaders to pressurise govt for MSP guarantee\n\nChanni also accused the government of not keeping its promises to the farmers.\n\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal intervened and accused the Congress MP of misleading the House, saying he should authenticate the allegations he was making.\n\nChanni accused the ruling party members of obstructing his speech and alleged that the government was overlooking farmers.\n\nHe stressed that the farmers had several demands, including one for a loan waiver.\n\nAs he alleged that National Security Act provisions were invoked against protesting farmers, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said Channi should authenticate the allegations and accused him of misleading the House.\n\nRijiju also urged the chair to move a privilege motion against Channi.\n\nThe war of words between the ruling and the opposition benches went on even after Channi concluded his speech and the chair adjourned the House till 3 pm as the ruckus continued.", "source": {"uri": "easternmirrornagaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eastern

The confrontation erupted during a debate on the Union Budget and quickly escalated as both leaders attacked each other at a personal level.\n\nChanni sparked the confrontation by referencing the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, the late former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, saying that he actually died the day Bittu joined the BJP.\n\n\"Your late grandfather was a martyr but he actually died the day you joined the BJP,\" Channi said.\n\nThe verbal duel intensified as Channi criticized the Modi government, comparing its governance to the British Raj and making a pointed comment about skin color.\n\nThis triggered a fierce response from Bittu, who now holds portfolios in Railways and Food Processing Industries. Bittu countered with allegations of corruption and serious misconduct against Channi. Amid the uproar, Bittu defended his grandfather's legacy, highlighting that Singh's sacrifice was for the nation and not any political party.\n\n\"Channi is talking about poverty; he is the most corrupt and rich person in Punjab, and I'll change my name if I'm proven wrong,\" Bittu said, further alleging that Channi was an accused in 'Me Too' as well.\n\nResponding to Channi's \"skin colour\" comment, Bittu retorted, \"It sounds like you're talking about Sonia Gandhi. Can you prove where she came from?\"\n\nBJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes as Opposition MPs created a ruckus.\"\n\nAs Opposition MPs created a ruckus, BJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes.\n\nAfter the session, Union MoS Ravneet Singh Bittu spoke to ANI, accusing Channi of behaving like a traitor and misleading the country. Bittu clarified that the NSA had been invoked against those who wanted to break the country and Punjab, not farmers as Channi had claimed. He further said that when challenged to provide evidence, Channi had no reply, and that the Congress party and the entire INDI Alliance were ashamed due to his actions.\n\n\"An ex-CM has spoken about breaking the country and Punjab. Congress and Rahul Gandhi were sitting before him and making him say it. When we told him to bring evidence to the Floor of the House, he went on backfoot and had no reply.

Channi labelled this a state of 'undeclared emergency' by the Centre.\n\nDuring a Lok Sabha debate, Channi referenced the recently concluded elections, stating, \"This is also an emergency that a Member of Parliament elected by 20 lakh people in Punjab has been detained under the NSA (National Security Act) ... He is unable to speak about his constituency here (in Parliament). This is also an emergency.\"\n\nAlthough the former Punjab CM did not specifically mention anyone, BJP leaders asserted he was referring to Amritpal Singh. Singh secured victory in the Khadoor Sahib constituency by approximately 200,000 votes in this year's Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThis action has led the BJP to lambast the Congress party's stance on supporting the Khalistan ideology. In a post on X, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla demanded the Congress' clarification whether it endorses the idea of Khalistan, which was linked to the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984.\n\n\"Batting for separatist who wants tukde tukde of India? Rahul ji must answer - the idea of Khalistan that caused the assassination of PM Indira ji is being hailed !! Why does Congress always bat for separatists and terrorists? Yakub, Afzal, 26/11 jihadis, now K terrorists?\" he said.\n\nUnion Minister Giriraj Singh described Congress MP Channi's comments made in Parliament as 'unfortunate.'\n\n\"The Khalistani who assassinated Indira Gandhi has received open support from Channi today, which means the Congress is siding with the Khalistanis. This is an attack on the integrity of India...what can I say, I will say action should be taken,\" Singh told PTI.\n\nChanni accused the central government of imposing an \"undeclared emergency\" in the country. This accusation came during a heated exchange with BJP's Ravneet Singh Bittu in the Lok Sabha, which resulted in a brief adjournment of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the debate on the Union Budget, Channi also blamed the BJP government for branding farmers as Khalistanis and claimed that his home state, Punjab, was neglected in this year's budget.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadoor_Sahib_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritpal_Singh_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amritpal Singh (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravneet_Singh_Bittu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravneet Singh Bittu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giriraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giriraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/25/1449405-solar-2024-07-25t202058.953.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762600", "eventUri": "eng-9762600", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Participating in a debate on the Union Budget, Channi referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.\n\nThis led to a war of words between Channi and Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP.\n\nBittu, the Minister of State for Railways and Food Processing Industries, countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nAmid the angry exchange of words, Congress member Amrinder Singh Raja Warring tried to enter the Well of the House, but was stopped by Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi.\n\nFrom the treasury benches, Bittu also tried to enter the Well.\n\nBJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, then adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes till 2 pm.\n\nWhen the House reconvened, Defence Minister and Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha Rajnath Singh urged Speaker Om Birla to remove any unparliamentary references and continue with the debate.\n\nBirla also directed the treasury and the opposition members to maintain the dignity of the House, adding that ministers especially should not break the rules.\n\nChanni then proceeded to conclude his speech.\n\nHe mentioned the meeting of Rahul Gandhi with some farmer leaders on Wednesday, adding that they had also sought time to meet the prime minister.\n\nChanni also accused the government of not keeping its promises to the farmers.\n\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal intervened and accused the Congress MP of misleading the House, saying he should authenticate the allegations he was making.\n\nChanni accused the ruling party members of obstructing his speech and alleged that the government was overlooking farmers.\n\nHe stressed that the farmers had several demands, including one for a loan waiver.\n\nAs he alleged that National Security Act provisions were invoked against protesting farmers, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said Channi should authenticate the allegations and accused him of misleading the House.\n\nRijiju also urged the chair to move a privilege motion against Channi.\n\nThe war of words between the ruling and the opposition benches went on even after Channi concluded his speech.\n\nAs Nationalist Congress Party MP Tatkare Sunil Dattatrey started his speech, Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee objected to a minister taking the seat next to the member.\n\nSpeaker Birla clarified that seats have not been allotted yet, and the minister was sitting on a seat meant for NDA members.\n\nBanerjee then said he would also sit on a different seat, and sat on the treasury benches' side. He later returned to his seat.\n\nAs the ruckus continued, Jagadambika Pal, who was then in chair, adjourned the House till 3 pm.\n\nThe House resumed normal functioning after it met at 3 pm.\n\nSpeaking outside Parliament later, Bittu accused former Punjab chief minister Channi of indulging in \"anti-national\" behaviour.\n\n\"An ex-CM was behaving like an anti-national, and is misleading the world through the House. What did he do? He said NSA was imposed on farmers, while NSA has been imposed on those who were trying to divide the country and Punjab,\" Bittu said.\n\n\"An ex-CM made remarks that were aimed at dividing the country and Punjab, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was sitting there. When I said on the floor that he should provide evidence, he went on back-foot. The Congress party and INDI alliance have been embarrassed because of him,\" Bittu said.\n\nIn February this year, as farmers camped at the Shambhu border in Punjab, Ambala police had issued a statement saying that it was implementing the process of detaining office bearers of the protesting farmer outfits under section 2(3) of the National Security Act, 1980, to maintain law and order and prevent criminal activities.\n\nHowever, the Haryana Police later announced it was withdrawing its earlier decision.\n\nFarmers from Samyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) have been camping on the Shambhu border of Punjab since February 13. The farmers had originally planned to march to Delhi to press the Centre for a legal guarantee of minimum support price for crops.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

There are various reasons stated behind their plight, but there are three main reasons - economy, economy, economy!\"\n\n\"If a common man earns Rs 10, then he has to pay Rs 3 for income tax, Rs 2 - 2.50 goes into GST, Rs 2 goes into Capital Gain charges and Rs 1 -1.50 goes into some other charges, which means Rs 7-8 goes into the treasury of the government. What does the common man gain? What do they do from these taxes? Are they providing world-class infrastructure, health care, transport, or education services? We, in India, pay taxes like England to get services like Somalia.\"\n\nHe alleged that the government has managed to displease all sections of society from the Budget 2024.\"Whenever a budget is presented, generally some sections of society get happy and some are disappointed but this time they have managed to disappoint every section of society. They have managed to displease all sections of society. In fact, this time supporters of the BJP are also disappointed.\"\n\nIn Lok Sabha, Baijayant Panda of BJP termed the Union Budget as historic.\n\n\"The Modi government embodies the principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, ensuring the dignity and well-being of every Indian. Together, we are advancing towards a Viksit and Aatmanirbhar Bharat,\" he said.\n\nFormer Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi triggered an uproar after he alleged that there is \"undeclared emergency\" under BJP-led government and noted that \"free speech\" of the Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh who is in jail is being curbed by invoking the National Security Act against him.\n\n\"They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?...This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.\"\n\n\"They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today's undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family. It is also an emergency when central agencies work against opposition leaders. It is also an emergency when farmers are declared as Khalistani when they ask for their rights. A concrete barricading has been created to stop them so they cannot arrive in Delhi. This is also an emergency. It is also an emergency that Manipur which has been constantly burning for the last 1.5-2 years is left in the plight condition. It is also an emergency that students who have been protesting for their rights have been declared anti-nationalists?\"\n\nAs Channi was speaking, Ravneet Singh Bittu referred to remarks pertaining to his father, and took strong exception to the Congress leader comparing the BJP-led government to the \"gora\" government of Britishers.\n\nBittu said his grandfather did not lay down his life for a party but for the country.\n\nHe alleged that Channi was talking of poor but had huge money resources. Bittu also made corruption allegations against Channi.\n\nResponding to the Congress leader's \"skin colour\" comment, Bittu made a veiled reference to foreign origins of Sonia Gandhi.\n\nBittu, a former Congress MP from Punjab, had joined the BJP ahead of Lok Sabha polls but lost the polls from Ludhiana. The House was adjourned till 2 pm amid huge uproar.\n\nWhen the House met again, Congress member KC Venugopal sought apology from Bittu over his remarks. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that unparliamentary words spoken from either side should be expunged.\n\nPiyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju demand that there should be breach of privilege against Channi over remarks pertaining to farmers protest.\n\nSpeaker Om Birla said members from both sides and specially ministers should ensure that dignity of House is lowered when they make their remarks. He said dignity of House should be maintained and action will be taken if aspersions are cast on the Chair.\n\nChanni's remarks related to Amritpal Singh caused huge political controversy with BJP attacking him. Congress distanced itself from his remarks.\n\n\"The views expressed by Charanjit Singh Channi, MP on Amritpal Singh are his own, and do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress,\" party leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.\n\nThe discussion on Union Budget started in the two Houses on Wednesday and is inconclusive. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will reply to the debate after the discussion concludes.

Channi alleged that there is \"undeclared emergency\" under the Modi govt and claimed that \"free speech\" of the Khalistani leader was being curbed.\n\nSpeaking during the debate on the Budget 2024, Charanjit Singh Channi said, \"They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day.

He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.\"\n\nHe alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family. Channi said, \"Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today's undeclared emergency in the country?

Amid the heated debate between the Treasury and the Opposition Benches, BJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings of the House for the first time around 1.30 pm for about 30 minutes.\n\nWhen the House reassembled at 2 pm, there was more drama as TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee tried to sit next to defence minister Rajanth Singh. The defence minister virtually stopped the TMC MP from doing so.\n\nThe Lok Sabha was adjourned twice on Thursday. In a debate on the Union Budget, Mr Channi referred to the assassination of Mr Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Mr Bittu quit the Congress to join the BJP.\n\nMr Bittu, who is serving as the minister of state in the Modi Cabinet, countered by making certain personal remarks against Mr Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nAmid the angry exchange of words, Congress MP Amrinder Singh Raja Warring tried to enter the Well of the House but was stopped by Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi. From the Treasury Benches, Mr Bittu also tried to enter the Well.\n\nAmid the ruckus, Ms Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes till 2 pm. When the House reconvened, Mr Singh urged Speaker Om Birla to remove any unparliamentary references and continue with the debate.\n\nMr Birla also directed the Treasury and the Opposition members to maintain the dignity of the House, adding that ministers especially should not break the rules.\n\nMr Channi then proceeded to conclude his speech. He mentioned the meeting of Nr Gandhi with some farmer leaders on Wednesday, adding that they had also sought time to meet the Prime Minister. He also accused the government of not keeping its promises to the farmers.\n\nCommerce minister Piyush Goyal intervened and accused Mr Channi of misleading the House, saying he should authenticate his allegations.\n\nMr Channi accused the members of the ruling party of obstructing his speech and alleged that the government was overlooking farmers. He stressed that the farmers had several demands, including one for a loan waiver.\n\nAs he alleged that National Security Act (NSA) provisions were invoked against protesting farmers, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said Mr Channi should authenticate the allegations and accused him of misleading the House.\n\nMr Rijiju also urged the chair to move a privilege motion against Mr Channi. The war of words between the ruling and the Opposition Benches went on even after the former Punjab chief minister concluded his speech.\n\nAs NCP MP Tatkare Sunil Dattatrey started his speech, Mr Banerjee objected to a minister taking the seat next to the member.\n\nMr Birla clarified that seats have not been allotted yet and the minister was sitting on a seat meant for the NDA members.\n\nMr Banerjee then said that he will also sit on a different seat and tried to sit next to the defence minister on the Treasury Benches' side. Mr Singh was seen stopping the TMC MP from doing so. He later returned to his seat.\n\nAs the ruckus continued, Jagadambika Pal, who was then in chair, adjourned the House till 3 pm. The House resumed normal functioning after it met at 3 pm.\n\nLater speaking outside Parliament, Mr Bittu accused Mr Channi of indulging in \"anti-national\" behaviour.\n\nMr Bittu said: \"An ex-CM was behaving like an anti-national and is misleading the world through the House. Why did he do? He said NSA was imposed on farmers, while NSA has been imposed on those who were trying to divide the country and Punjab.\"\n\n\"An ex-CM made remarks that were aimed at dividing the country and Punjab while Mr Gandhi was sitting there. When I said on the floor that he should provide evidence, he went on the backfoot. The Congress party and INDIA bloc have been embarrassed because of him,\" Mr Bittu said.\n\nDuring a debate in Lok Sabha without naming anyone, Mr Channi said, \"This is also an emergency that a member of Parliament elected by 20-lakh people in Punjab has been detained under the National Security Act... He is unable to speak about his constituency here (in Parliament). This is also an emergency.\"\n\nWhile Mr Channi did not name anyone, BJP leaders said that he was speaking about Amritpal Singh, who won the Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency by a margin of around 2-lakh votes in the general election.\n\nHe listed the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala case, action against the Opposition leaders by Central agencies and alleged mistreatment of farmers, women athletes, and journalists as evidence of this. Union minister Giriraj Singh said that Mr Channi's remarks made inside Parliament were \"unfortunate\". \"The Khalistani who assassinated former PM Indira Gandhi has received open support from Mr Channi today, which means the Congress is siding with the Khalistanis. This is an attack on the integrity of India... I will say action should be taken,\" Mr Singh said.\n\nParticipating in the Budget debate, Trinamul MP Saugata Roy stated that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is not a \"trained economist\" and the Budget presented by her was based on notes received from the Prime Minister's Office as she has \"no original ideas\".\n\n\"I do not expect the finance minister to be like Manmohan Singh...,\" Mr Roy said.\n\nMr Roy said: \"You (Ms Sitharaman) have been a minister for seven years. You are not a trained economist...you have been lucky that way.\" Some members of the House raised voices opposing his statement.\n\nSamajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav said the Budget is \"political\" and Uttar Pradesh has been overlooked in the budget.\n\nRashtriya Lok Dal leader and Union minister Jayant Choudhary, however, said Ms Sitharaman will reply to the leaders' allegations in the House.\n\n\"The finance minister will reply to it in the House. This is not the first time some states are mentioned or some schemes are mentioned. Nirmala ji is an experienced finance minister. She named some states; no one should be jealous,\" he said.\n\nMr Sitharaman on Tuesday announced significant financial measures for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, ruled by key NDA allies -- Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and Chandrababu Naidu's TDP -- which are providing critical support to the BJP-led government at the Centre.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The House was adjourned twice during the afternoon session.\n\nWhile taking part in the discussion on the Union Budget, Mr. Channi made a reference to the assassination of Mr. Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh. Mr. Bittu, who was a three-time Congress MP before joining the BJP earlier this year, countered by making certain personal remarks against senior Congress leaders. The specific comments were later expunged by the Speaker.\n\nAt this point, Congress MP Amrinder Singh Raja Warring tried to enter the Well of the House. He was, however, stopped by the Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi. From the treasury side, Mr. Bittu also tried to enter the Well, at which point BJP member Sandhya Ray, who was officiating as the Speaker, adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes till 2 p.m.\n\nWhen the House reassembled, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh asked Speaker Om Birla to remove all unparliamentary references from the records. The Speaker also asked all MPs to maintain the dignity of the House and said that Ministers especially should not break any rules.\n\n'Undeclared emergency'\n\nResuming his speech, Mr. Channi accused the government of not keeping its promises to the farming community, noting that the farmers who had met with Mr. Gandhi on Wednesday had also sought time to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nClaiming that there was an \"undeclared emergency\" in the country, he listed as evidence the lack of progress in the Sidhu Moosewala murder case, actions taken against Opposition leaders by central agencies, and the alleged mistreatment of farmers and women athletes.\n\nHe also referred to Khadoor Sahib MP Amritpal Singh without taking his name. \"This too is emergency, that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency here. This too is emergency.\"\n\n'NSA against farmers'\n\nUnion Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal accused the Congress MP of misleading the House, saying he should authenticate the allegations he was making about the National Security Act (NSA) being invoked against the protesting farmers. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju also urged the Speaker to move a privilege motion against Mr. Channi.\n\nAs the ruckus continued even after Mr. Channi's speech, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal, who was in the Speaker's chair, adjourned the House till 3 p.m.\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the House later, Mr. Bittu accused Mr. Channi of indulging in \"anti-national\" behaviour. \"An ex-CM was behaving like an anti-national, and is misleading the world through the House. What did he do? He said NSA was imposed on farmers, while NSA has been imposed on those who were trying to divide the country and Punjab,\" he said.\n\n'No original ideas in Budget'\n\nMeanwhile, participating in the debate in the Lok Sabha, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy said that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was not a \"trained economist\" and had \"no original ideas\". He claimed that the Budget was based on notes received from the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nHibi Eden, the Congress MP from Ernakulam, said that though Kerala was facing a huge financial crisis, the Union government has failed to announce any special package for the State.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant complained that the schemes for generating employment are all for just two years. \"This will just be like Agniveer,\" he said, in a reference to the Army's contentious short-term service programme.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

He took further potshots at the government over its \"dictatorial attitude\".\n\nAn irate Bittu stood up to speak, saying he must answer his former party colleague. \"I have to respond because he took the name of my grandfather. My grandfather did not lay down his life for a party but for the country,\" he said.\n\nBittu went on to say that he would change his name if Channi could prove that he was poor. He alleged that the Congress MP has the most powerful resources and most money in Punjab to date. He also claimed that Channi was an accused in a sexual harassment case. Responding to the Congress leader's \"skin colour\" comment, Bittu said that it seemed he was referring to Sonia Gandhi and asked the party to prove which country she came from.\n\nFollowing this, there was chaos in the Lok Sabha, as Punjab Congress MPs stormed into the well, challenging Bittu to a fight. \"Himmat hai toh aaja (Come if you dare),\" a Congress lawmaker could be heard saying. Bittu tried to rush into the well but was stopped by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who asked him to calm down.\n\nBittu, a three-term former Congress MP from Punjab, had joined the BJP just ahead of the April-June Lok Sabha polls, triggering a wave of animosity from his former party colleagues. He contested on a BJP ticket seeking re-election from the Ludhiana Lok Sabha seat but lost to Congress's Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal objected to his comments saying the Congress MP has made incorrect remarks. He accused him of misleading the farmers. Mr Goyal also questioned Mr. Channi over his comments that the National Security Act was invoked on farmers saying the Congress members should authenticate his claims. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiu alleged that Mr. Channi has made misleading comments about farmers in the House and that his matter should be referred to the Privilege Committee.

But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?...This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.\"\n\nHe made a scathing attack at the BJP led-NDA government and alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family.\n\nStating the data, Channi said, \"Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today's undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family.\"\n\nElaborating about the issues which are evident and due to which he is calling an \"imposition of undeclared emergency\" in the country, Charanjit Singh Channi said, \"It is also an emergency when central agencies work against opposition leaders. It is also an emergency when farmers are declared as Khalistani when they ask for their rights. A concrete barricading has been created to stop them so they cannot arrive in Delhi. This is also an emergency. It is also an emergency that Manipur which has been constantly burning for the last 1.5-2 years is left in the plight condition. It is also an emergency that students who have been protesting for their rights have been declared anti-nationalists?\"\n\nHe further blamed the government for treating farmers as their \"enemy\" and said that they government is ignoring the demands of farmers.\n\nSlamming the Centre for putting up spikes so as to prevent farmers entering the national capital, Channi said, \"Farmers want to meet PM Modi and the government, but they are being stopped at the Haryana Border and they have put a concrete barricading at the border. Aren't we Punjabis in India? Haryana Police has gun fired at the farmers but there is no investigation on them upon this issue. I want to ask why farmers are your enemy.\"\n\nFormer CM Channi slammed the Budget 2024 and alleged that this budget is only for saving the government.\n\nChanni alleged the government for discriminating between the citizens of the nation and said, \"In the Budget session, we thought we would get something, but we didn't get anything. This government is not behaving equally with all the citizens, as they have worn political spectacles on them. This budget is only to save their government.\n\nAs there is an allocation of funds for the flood-affected regions of the nation in the Budget 2024, taking a jibe at it, former CM Channi said, \"They didn't notice the floods in Punjab.\"\n\nHe further alleged the government for Punjab's bad condition and said, \"They couldn't even increase the duration of the MGNREGA scheme. There is nothing in this budget for Punjab. Nothing was allotted for the drowning industries of Jalandhar. They have declared Jalandhar a smart city, but from water to railways and roads, everything is in deteriorating condition in Jalandhar.\"\n\nChanni also slammed the government and said, \"I think this government has been exhausted by ruling for 10 years. But I think they are left with no sincerity as we are having discussions on the budget but the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and Finance Minister, everybody is absent. Where are they?

While his remark was expunged from the Lok Sabha records, it drew a strong rebuttal from the BJP, which questioned if the Congress has started backing Khalistan sympathisers despite the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nBJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala posted a scathing message on social media.\n\n\"Congress MP and Former Punjab CM Channi bats for radical pro-Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh. Is this Jai Sanvidhan? Batting for separatist who wants tukde tukde of India ? Rahul ji must answer - the idea of Khalistan that caused the assassination of PM Indira ji is being hailed !! Why does Congress always bat for separatists and terrorists ? Yakub Afzal 26/11 jihadis Now K Terrorists?\" his post read.\n\nThe Congress has already distanced itself from Mr Channi's comments. \"The views expressed by Charanjit Singh Channi, MP on Amritpal Singh are his own, and do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress,\" the party's media in-charge Jairam Ramesh posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAmritpal Singh --- accused of being a Khalistan sympathizer -- was arrested under the National Security Act (NSA). He contested the recent Lok Sabha election from jail and became a Lok Sabha member after winning from Khadoor by four lakh votes.\n\n\"The Congress party is now supporting separatist, Khalistani elements? The same Congress party makes tall claims about protecting the constitution, are they protecting the constitution by saying this? The person who stands by the assassination of Indira Gandhi, who talks about dividing the country, you are supporting him today. this is competitive appeasement politics on display,\" Mr Poonawala also said.\n\nUnion minister Giriraj Singh said Congress MP Channi's remarks made in Parliament were \"unfortunate\".\n\n\"On Channi's statement, I would only say that Indira Gandhi's assassin was a Khalistani and Congress is supporting Khalistani. Waah re Congress, Jai Channi. This is an attack on India's sovereignty. Action should be taken on this...Congress ka haath, Khalistanion ke saath,\" he told reporters outside parliament.\n\nBJP MP Dinesh Sharma demanded that the Congress expel Mr Channi.\n\nDeclaring that Mr Channi was \"working at the behest of anti-national elements from Canada,\" he said, \"The Congress should expel him, and if Congress doesn't take action against him, it means that somewhere Congress is in cahoots with these anti-social and anti-national elements\".\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann also distanced himself from the comment, saying it was Mr Channi's \"personal opinion\".\n\nBut his comment carried a sting in the tail for Aam Aadmi Party's INDIA ally. \"The Congress should decide their stand. Half the Congress is not in tune. To maintain law and order we will take action. I am not a custodian of one MP. I am the custodian of people of Punjab,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritpal_Singh_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amritpal Singh (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Punjab_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Punjab (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Indira_Gandhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giriraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giriraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagwant_Mann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhagwant Mann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/k4o01dk8_amritpal-singh_625x300_18_June_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762600", "eventUri": "eng-9762600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He didn't die on that day but he died on the day when you left Congress.\"\n\nDuring the Lok Sabha election campaign, Bittu was dubbed a traitor by Congress leaders, a charge made in Parliament on Thursday as well. A three-time Congress MP, he had switched to the BJP in March this year ahead of the polls. He contested on the BJP ticket from Ludhiana but lost to the Congress's Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.\n\nReplying to the charge, Bittu got up from his seat and said, \"My grandfather had sacrificed his life for the country and not for the Congress party. He sacrificed his life for the country.\"\n\nCalling Channi to be \"the most corrupt person in Punjab\", Bittu said, \"He has properties worth crores in Punjab and he is talking about poverty.\"\n\nReacting to the Budget, the Jalandhar MP had earlier termed the BJP another East India Company, saying \"difference is only of skin colour\".\n\nTo this, Bittu stated, \"Whom are you calling gora (white people)? Sonia Gandhiji has come from which place? He should tell that as well.\"\n\nMP Sandhya Rai was in Chair when this heated exchange took place. Their mikes were turned off and even the Lok Sabha was adjourned for some time.\n\nKeeping up his attack on the BJP, Channi said, \"Popular singer Sidhu Moosewala was killed but his family is running from pillar to post for justice. This is an undeclared emergency. A person (Khadoor Sahib MP Amritpal Singh) who has been chosen by 20 lakh people has been put behind bars by imposing NSA. Farmers who are protesting for their genuine demands are not being allowed to march towards Delhi and are labelled as Khalistani.\"\n\nThe Jalandhar MP stated that while debate on the Budget was going on neither the PM nor the FM were present in Parliament. \"The budget has shown income of Rs 32 lakh crore and expenditure of Rs 48 lakh crore. The gap is of Rs 16 lakh crore. They have plans to take a loan of Rs 14 lakh crore.

Puri defended the government's actions in Punjab and other states, while Channi accused the BJP of stifling dissent and creating a financial emergency-like situation.\n\nUnion Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday refuted claims by Congress MP Charanjit Singh Channi regarding an 'undeclared emergency' and the jailing of MP Amritpal Singh. Puri asserted that Channi lacks understanding of the historical Emergency declared on June 25, 1975, by the then Congress government, which he accused of 'murdering the Constitution.'\n\nPuri highlighted that during discussions on the Union Budget and Jammu & Kashmir Budget, some MPs tried to connect present issues to historical events, including the specter of Bhindranwale. He noted, 'A lot of statements were made, but FM and others have highlighted what has been done for other states.

He added that his home state Punjab was ignored in this year's budget.\n\nChanni said, \"It's not a budget to save the country, it's just to save their government. They haven't addressed the floods in Punjab, haven't raised wages and have ignored Punjab in this budget.\" During the course of the debate, Lok Sabha was adjourned twice in the post-lunch period as a war of words broke out between the treasury and opposition benches, triggered by Channi's spat with BJP's Ravneet Singh Bittu.\n\nParticipating in a debate, Channi referred to the assassination of Bittu's grandfather, former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.\n\nThis led to a war of words between Channi and Bittu, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP.\n\nBittu, the minister of state for Railways and Food Processing Industries, countered by making certain personal remarks against Channi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, triggering an uproar.\n\nThe war of words between the ruling and the opposition benches went on even after Channi concluded his speech.\n\nAs Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Tatkare Sunil Dattatrey started his speech, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee objected to a minister taking the seat next to the member.\n\nSpeaker Om Birla clarified that seats have not been allotted yet and the minister was sitting on a seat meant for the NDA members.\n\nBanerjee then said he would also sit on a different seat, and sat on the treasury benches' side. He later returned to his seat.\n\nAs the ruckus continued, Jagadambika Pal, who was then in chair, adjourned the House till 3 pm.\n\nThe House resumed normal functioning after it met at 3 pm.\n\nShiv Sena member D Mane later took at jibe at Banerjee, saying to sit in the treasury benches required people's mandate.\n\nAs the opposition questioned sops for Bihar, being governed by NDA's key ally JD(U), BJP's Vivek Thakur said the Congress and its allies cannot digest the development of the state.\n\nHe said nothing was done for decades on flood mitigation but now things have changed.\n\nIn Rajya Sabha, AAP MP Raghav Chadha said the government's decision to remove indexation benefit on sale of old property will result in huge inflow of black money in real estate and investments in the sector will go down.\n\nAsking the government to roll back the proposal, Chadha said people will never be able to buy their \"dream homes\".\n\n\"Restore indexation on long-term capital gains. Throughout the world, to woo investors to invest, they are incentivised. In this country, by removing indexation we are disincentivising the investor class,\" he said, adding that removing indexation is not imposing tax but it is equivalent to \"penalising investors\".\n\nCongress Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) has become 'maximum suffering' for farmers under Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and the budget has failed to address the issues of people involved in farm activities.\n\nSurjewala claimed that the the budget is an attempt to save the coalition government, appease allies and take revenge for defeat.\n\n\"When the finance minister began the budget speech with three words -- farmers, poor and youth -- the whole nation was filled with expectations but within minutes it was clear that this budget is 'kursi bachao, sahiyogi dal patao, aur haar ka badla lete jao budget' (save the government, appease allies and take revenge for defeat),\" he said.

Channi objected to the absence of the PM, home minister and the finance minister from the House and said how could the government take note of MPs' views on the budget. Being one of the few ministers present then, Ravneet Singh Bittu tried to counter Channi.\n\nThings reached a flash point after Channi made a remark comparing BJP with the East India company and alleged their approach was the same but only the colour was different as one belonged to white. He alleged there \"is an undeclared emergency\" and tried to justify his charge by citing incidents, including the arrest of some farmers and killing of singer Sidhu Moosalawala. He also said an elected MP from Punjab (a reference to pro-Khalistan Amritpal Singh) was still in jail under the National Security Act and asked how this MP could serve his constituency from jail.\n\nAs Bittu tried to rebut Channi, the latter recalled how Bittu's grandfather (ex-CM) Beant Singh was a martyr, and targeted the junior minister for leaving Congress for BJP. Bittu hit back by questioning Channi's integrity and tried to counter the latter's reference to white-coloured people by making a comment about Congress's Sonia Gandhi.\n\nAs these comments made Congress MPs protest, Bittu charged towards the edge of the Well by daring Opposition MPs. Some Congress MPs including Amrinder Singh Raja Warring (who defeated Bittu in the poll) tried to charge from the other side. Many other MPs from both sides rushed to hold back the agitated lot even as the Chair adjourned the House till 2 pm. Later, Speaker Om Birla appealed to both sides to restrain in their conduct and later expunged from record the exact comments of both Channi and Bittu.\n\nBarely the House reassembled, came another row with Kalyan Banerjee of Trinamool objecting to parliamentary affairs minister Kiran Rijiju sitting close to NCP MP Sunil Tatkare who was speaking. Banerjee kept insisting that Rijiju move to his original seat, even as Trinamool floor leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay tried to calm down his colleague.\n\nWhile the presiding officer pointed out that the minister was sitting in NDA benches, Banerjee walked on to the front row of the treasury benches and tried to sit where usually minister Nitin Gadkari (who was not present) sits. As MPs protested, defence minister Rajnath Singh was seen holding Banerjee's hand and persuading him to return to his seat. Then Banerjee moved to where Rijiju was sitting and started speaking loudly, prompting the minister to push him down and make him sit next to him, even as Banerjee started pulling to free himself. In the mele, the House adjourned till 3 pm.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravneet_Singh_Bittu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravneet Singh Bittu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East India Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beant_Singh_(assassin)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beant Singh (assassin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajnath_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajnath Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrinder_Singh_Raja_Warring", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amrinder Singh Raja Warring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_Birla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Om Birla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudip_Bandyopadhyay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudip Bandyopadhyay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan_Banerjee_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalyan Banerjee (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Tatkare", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Tatkare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Defence_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Defence (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitin_Gadkari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nitin Gadkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112023916,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-51152,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762600", "eventUri": "eng-9762600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He cannot even communicate with his constituents; this too is an emergency.\"\n\nChanni criticized the BJP-led NDA government, asserting that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation. He cited the case of renowned Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, whose family has allegedly not received justice after his killing.\n\nBacking his statements with data, Channi added, \"Currently, the country is facing a situation akin to financial emergency under the BJP government's rule. While the BJP often refers to the 1975 emergency, what about the present-day emergency in the country?\"\n\nHe further elaborated on the situations contributing to what he terms as the 'enforcement of an undeclared emergency,' stating, \"It is also an emergency when central agencies target opposition leaders. Additionally, the categorization of farmers as Khalistan terrorists when they demand their rights is a glaring example of emergency.\"\n\nChanni highlighted that barriers have been erected to prevent farmers from reaching Delhi to protest against the government.\n\n\"It is also a state of emergency that Manipur has been embroiled in unrest for the past 1.5 years, with no action taken by the government to resolve the conflict between the Meiteis and Kukis communities. Furthermore, labeling protesting students as anti-national is another manifestation of this emergency,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupwara_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kupwara district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidhu_Moose_Wala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidhu Moose Wala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjabi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meitei people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuki people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Charanjit-Singh-channi-.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762600", "eventUri": "eng-9762600", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 314}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He added that his home state Punjab was ignored in this year's budget.\n\nChanni said, \"It's not a budget to save the country, it's just to save their government.

He made the reference to ministers when Congress leader K C Venugopal said a minister walked towards the Opposition benches, which he saw as an attempt to \"attack\" them.

Bittu, who quit the Congress to join the BJP, said: \"My grandfather sacrificed his life for the country, not Congress.\" The Minister of State for Railways then made some personal remarks against Channi.

Action should be taken on this...Congress ka haath, Khalistanion ke saath,\" he added.\n\nBJP MP and Union minister Prahlad Joshi also condemned Channi's remarks and said, \"This issue is in court. Serious allegations are against him (Amritpal Singh). It's not right to talk about it in the Parliament. It's before the people, what Congress has done.\"\n\n\"He (Charanjit Singh Channi) was not there during the Emergency, so he didn't know what was the condition then. Today, they keep commenting over the PM, was it possible to make such comments over Indira Gandhi, during the Emergency?\" he added.\n\nFollowing row over Channi's statement, Congress backed the former CM. Punjab Congress chief and MP Amarinder Singh Raja Warring clarified party's stance and said, \"I have not heard the complete statement but I would like to say that due facilities as per the Constitution should be provided to every elected individual (MP) - be it me, or Amritpal or anyone else.\"\n\n\"Nobody has the right to violate laws - be it anybody. So, I have been saying from the first day that there should be no injustice to anyone as per the Constitution - be it anyone,\" he added.\n\nThe former Punjab CM, referring to Amritpal's win in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, said, \"Every day they talk about emergencies, but what about the current situation in the country? A famous young man, a well-known singer, was shot dead, and till now, Sidhu Moosewala's family has not received justice and is wandering from place to place.\"\n\n\"This is also an emergency. It is also an emergency that a Member of Parliament elected by 2 million people in Punjab is being detained under the National Security Act and cannot speak for his constituents. This is also an emergency,\" he added.\n\nAmritpal, a Khalistani sympathizer and head of the 'Waris Punjab De' outfit, is held for offenses under the National Security Act and has garnered attention for his radical activities, including an incident in February where he clashed with police in an attempt to free an aide.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Greg Abbott's recent order to ignore updated Title IX law language.\n\nTitle IX is a civil rights law enacted in 1972 that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or education programs that receive federal funding. New regulations set to go into effect Aug. 1 make it clear that Title IX also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Under Title IX, LGBTQ+ students who experience discrimination are entitled to a response from their school; if their institution doesn't respond, the student may pursue a remedy from the federal government.\n\nIn the letter to the THECB, lawmakers wrote Abbott's order \"will not only nullify students' and faculty members' civil rights protections but also jeopardize these institutions' ability to receive billions of dollars from the federal government when the new academic year begins.\" Lawmakers also wrote, how following the governor's order would lead to catastrophic consequences, writing \"institutions would be unable to provide scholarships needed for most students to afford and access colleges and universities.\"\n\nIn a statement from the governor's office, Abbott sent a letter to the state's public university systems and community colleges reiterating how he \"already made clear Texas will not comply with President Joe Biden's rewrite of Title IX that contradicts the original purpose and spirit of the law to support the advancement of women.\"\n\nAbbott also previously tweeted on X that he complained in a letter to the president that the revision of Title IX \"forces schools to treat biological men as women\" and that Texas would ignore the \"illegal dictate.\" \"The law was based on the fundamental premise that there are only two sexes -- male and female. You have rewritten Title IX to force schools to treat boys as if they are girls and to accept every student's self-declared gender identity. This ham-handed effort to impose a leftist belief onto Title IX exceeds your authority as President. I am instructing the Texas Education Agency to ignore your illegal dictate.\"\n\nDallas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-Dist. 30) led the letter to the THECB signed by other Texas Democrats, such as Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, and Sheila Jackson Lee. The letter reminded the committee that \"as a body that regularly engages with the department for receipt of federal funds, you know that in order for educational institutions to receive federal money, they must comply with all federal laws -- not just those the state's governor likes.\"\n\nThe letter arrived the same day a Kentucky judge blocked the Title IX language updates in six states, posing another obstacle to the Biden administration's efforts to extend protections for LGBTQ+ students. The Kentucky judge's decision came a week after a North Texas judge ruled to strike down Title IX guidance in a suit filed by the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nPaxton contended that the new federal law would force schools to allow men in women's restrooms and on women's sports teams and create issues with people who don't use one's preferred pronouns. This led him to sue President Joe Biden's administration in April over the new regulations and file a motion to stop the agency's action and for a preliminary injunction in May.\n\nU.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves described the rule as \"arbitrary in the truest sense of the word\" and granted a preliminary injunction to stop it in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. His decision was made a few days after one of the federal judges in Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Montana temporarily halted the new rule's implementation.\n\nAt least seven legal challenges to President Joe Biden's new policy have been launched by the attorneys general of more than 20 states run by Republicans. Republicans contend that the regulation is a front to permit transgender girls to participate in sports on female teams. According to the Biden administration, athletes are exempt from the rule.\n\nThe Fairness Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization in Kentucky, criticized the ruling. The executive director of the organization, Chris Hartman, stated that the decision \"ignores basic truths about the transgender community and further places transgender kids in the crosshairs, who are among our smallest and most vulnerable populations.\"\n\nIn several GOP states, transgender girls are prohibited from participating on girls' sports teams by law. These states contend that the new rule would make it more permissible. The Biden administration has suggested a separate rule that would forbid such absolute restrictions, but it said the newly finalized rule does not apply to athletics.\n\nThe Education Department said it would \"continue to fight for every student\" as it reviews the ruling.\n\n\"Title IX guarantees that no person experience sex discrimination in a federally funded educational environment,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The department crafted the final Title IX regulations following a rigorous process.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort

Clayton County -- which dealt with whether LGBTQ people were protected from workplace discrimination by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act -- justified extending similar, but not identical, sex-discrimination protections to LGBTQ students under Title IX.\n\n\"At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining 'sex' to include 'gender identity.' But 'sex' and 'gender identity' do not mean the same thing,\" Reeves wrote. \"The Department's interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.\"\n\nReeves argued that separating students based on sex on sports teams and in restrooms and changing facilities was integral to ensuring that women are guaranteed equal opportunities and access to resources, as dictated by Title IX.\n\nHe also claimed that schools that failed to conform to the Biden administration's interpretation of Title IX risked losing federal funding and might suffer \"irreparable harm\" as a result.\n\nReeves contended that the rules could violate the First Amendment rights of teachers or students who deny the existence of gender identity and refuse to use pronouns or names that affirm a transgender person's gender identity.\n\n\"It is unclear how the Government's articulated position can be seen as anything less than a tacit endorsement of a content-based heckler's veto,\" he wrote. \"So long as the offended individuals complain with sufficient vigor, the refusal to abide by preferred pronouns can be deemed harassment and exposes a recipient of Federal funds to liability under Title IX....\n\n\"The Department's Final Rule forces the Nation's schools and educators to convey a message ordained in Washington, D.C., while silencing dissenting opinions and undermining state law and the discretion of local school boards. ... Under the Final Rule, these teachers will be silenced.\"\n\nReeves argues that the Education Department failed to account for how the Title IX guidance will impact the constitutional right of parents to influence their child's education, pointing to hypothetical situations in which a student's desire to use names or pronouns that differ from those on their official school record conflict with a parent's desire not to affirm their child's purported gender identity.\n\n\"Although the Final Rule gestures at retaining a certain role for parents, it does not provide that parental opposition to their child's selective gender identity requires schools to exempt that student from Title IX's new mandate,\" Reeves wrote. \"To the contrary, it implies that Title IX could supersede parental preferences about a child's treatment depending on the case.\"\n\nLastly, Reeves argues that not maintaining spaces segregated based on a person's assigned sex at birth undermines the very spirit of Title IX, and infringes on the bodily privacy of students who would be forced to share multi-user facilities with transgender students.\n\n\"[D]espite society's enduring recognition of biological differences between the sexes, as well as an individual's basic right to bodily privacy, the Final Rule mandates that schools permit biological men into women's intimate spaces, and women into men's, within the educational environment based entirely on a person's subjective gender identity,\" he wrote. \"This result is not only impossible to square with Title IX but with the broader guarantee of education protection for all students.\n\n\"Ultimately, the Department's failure to provide any concrete, contradictory data to the concerns raised by the States, parents, and educators renders it difficult to fathom how it determined that 'the benefits' of the new regulations 'far outweigh [their] estimated costs.'\"", "source": {"uri": "metroweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro

This decision marks the second time a judge has sided with Republican attorneys general in opposing Title IX expansions.\n\nJudge Danny Reeves of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Kentucky issued a ruling on Monday against the expanded Title IX protections issued by Biden and the Department of Education in April. Reeves' ruling blocked the new rules in the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nHis ruling joins a separate judge's order from last week that blocked the protections in Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Montana.\n\nConnect with the issues and events that impact your community at home and beyond by subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nSetting the tone for the 93-page ruling, Reeves began his ruling by saying, \"There are two sexes: male and female.\" He went on to block the rules by arguing that they're a First Amendment violation, and that they equate the definition of two different terms -- sex and gender identity -- leading to an over-expansion of federal legal protections.\n\n\"'Sex' and 'gender identity' do not mean the same thing,\" Reeves wrote. \"The Department's interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.\"\n\n\"The Final Rule also has serious First Amendment implications,\" he continued. \"The rule includes a new definition of sexual harassment which may require educators to use pronouns consistent with a student's purported gender identity rather than their biological sex.\"\n\nThe rules would have expanded gender-based protections, something enshrined under Title IX, a 1972 federal law established to give girls and women fair educational opportunities. The new protections also prohibited discrimination on the basis of one's abortion history or whether someone is transgender. The rules rolled back policies put in place by the administration of then-President Donald Trump that undermined anti-discrimination protection for LGBTQ+ people put in place by his predecessor, President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Based on the 'pervasive' nature of pronoun usage in everyday life, educators likely would be required to use students' preferred pronouns regardless of whether doing so conflicts with the educator's religious or moral beliefs,\" Reeves' ruling continued. \"A rule that compels speech and engages in such viewpoint discrimination is impermissible.\"\n\nReeves also wrote that the new rules would constitute disproportionate harm onto these states by depriving them of federal funding. The DOE said schools that do not follow the new rules face possible investigation and a loss of federal education funding.\n\n\"The loss of these funds undoubtedly would have a devastating impact on the plaintiff- States' public schools and their students,\" Reeves wrote. \"And while the Department of Education must seek voluntary compliance before terminating any funds that are given to states under Title IX, 'the States' injury as alleged has an immediate effect on the States' ordering of their own affairs.\"\n\nThe topic of athletics comes up multiple times in Reeves' ruling as well. However, the initial Biden rules did not specify any protections for transgender students on athletic sports teams.\n\nReeves concluded his argument by stating that the reasoning given by the DOE for the rules is \"arbitrary and capricious,\" stating \"the [DOE] does not provide a sufficient explanation for leaving regulations in place that conflict with the new gender-identity mandate, nor does it meaningfully respond to commentors' concerns regarding risks posed to student and faculty safety.\"\n\nReeves was nominated as a judge by President George W. Bush in 2001.\n\nIn a press release, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman (R) said, \"As a parent and as Attorney General, I joined this effort to protect our women and girls from harm. Today's ruling recognized the 50-plus years of educational opportunities Title IX has created for students and athletes. We're grateful for the court's ruling, and we will continue to fight the Biden Administration's attempts to rip away protections to advance its political agenda.\"\n\nA DOE spokesperson told the Washington Blade they are still reviewing the ruling but, \"Title IX guarantees that no person experience sex discrimination in a federally-funded educational environment. The department crafted the final Title IX regulations following a rigorous process to realize the Title IX statutory guarantee. The department stands by the final Title IX regulations released in April 2024, and we will continue to fight for every student.\"", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Here we take a look at Title IX, the government's rulemaking process, what's been happening, and what comes next.\n\nKeep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.\n\nIt's a federal law that was signed by President Richard Nixon -- yes! -- in 1972, as the second-wave feminist movement gathered steam. As part of the Education Amendments of 1972, it amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban sex discrimination in any educational program that receives federal funds. It states, \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" It covers K-12 schools as well as colleges and universities.\n\nU.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, a Hawaii Democrat, was the chief author and sponsor of Title IX. She was the first Asian American woman and first woman of color overall to serve in Congress. Two other Democrats, U.S. Rep. Edith Green of Oregon and U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana, were also key backers of the legislation.\n\nTitle IX is enforced by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which has the duty of investigating complaints about noncompliance with Title IX, which anyone can file. The law includes a provision allowing the federal government to withdraw funds from schools that are not in compliance, but so far the government has never done so, even though an estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of schools are out of compliance, at least in the realm of athletics, according to the Women's Sports Foundation. When the OCR determines an institution is not complying, it \"finds them 'in compliance conditioned on remedying identified problems,'\" the foundation notes.\n\nThe law has been controversial ever since it passed. These days, those who oppose expanding Title IX to protect LGBTQ+ students, especially transgender students, often make the questionable argument that they're acting in the name of women's rights -- questionable because they're usually conservative Republicans who don't seem to care about women's rights otherwise. But early on, Title IX was denounced by many on the far right. They include no less than the late U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican known for homophobia and misogyny. In 1975, he introduced a bill condemning Title IX in its entirety, and it didn't pass, but he then tried to limit its application to athletics. He was again unsuccessful.\n\nThe scope of Title IX has varied over the years, being limited or expanded by court decisions or congressional action. It can be changed by other means as well. On the first day of his presidency in 2021, Joe Biden directed federal agencies to apply the findings of Bostock v. Clayton County, a 2020 Supreme Court decision, in their handling of laws. In Bostock, the court ruled that workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Biden wanted this applied in venues other than the workplace, so for the Department of Education, this meant advising educational institutions that they should consider discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity to be sex discrimination under Title IX. This guidance was nonbinding, as was similar guidance issued under President Barack Obama in 2016, but it did warn schools they could be violating federal law if they discriminate in this fashion. The Obama guidance ended up being blocked in court and then revoked when Donald Trump became president. After Trump's action, schools remained free to enact LGBTQ-inclusive policies, but they didn't have the federal government advising them to do so.\n\nThe Biden guidance is still out there and being haggled over in court, but this year his administration made another move toward expanding Title IX to cover LGBTQ+ students, using the federal rulemaking process. Readers might ask, doesn't it take a court decision or congressional action to expand a law? Not always. Congress gives federal agencies the authority to issue regulations concerning enforcement of laws, using the rulemaking process. The agencies must publish notices of proposed and final rules in the Federal Register and allow a period of public comment before a rule becomes final. Unlike guidance, a rule is legally binding.\n\nThe Department of Education released its final Title IX rule in April, and it is set to take effect August 1. It clarifies that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is unlawful sex discrimination. Schools that don't allow transgender and nonbinary students access to the restrooms or locker rooms of their choice or use their chosen pronouns would be committing illegal discrimination, as would those that don't intervene in anti-LGBTQ+ bullying or harassment. The rule would also expand protections for students who are pregnant or parenting. It establishes clear requirements for schools to respond promptly to complaints, investigate them in a transparent and impartial manner, remedy any discrimination, and prevent its recurrence.\n\nRepublican attorneys general in states around the nation quickly filed lawsuits aimed at keeping the rule from going into effect; so far suits have been filed from 26 states. The AGs often claim they are protecting girls and women from harassment by trans people in restrooms, even though it's trans people who generally suffer harassment. Some also claim they're protecting women's sports. But actually, the rule in question doesn't address athletics. The Department of Education has proposed a separate rule stating that overall exclusion of trans student athletes from competing under their gender identity is unlawful discrimination but allowing schools to exclude them in certain circumstances. This rule has not been finalized.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuits, education officials in some states are advising schools to ignore the Title IX rule. They include South Carolina Superintendent of Education Ellen Weaver and Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters. And in Utah, the state legislature will meet in special session Wednesday in an attempt to block enforcement of the rule there, using a state law under which legislators can decide not to comply with any law they believe violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe nonbinding guidance is being challenged as well. Last week a judge in Texas temporarily blocked application the guidance as a result of a lawsuit brought there. In 2022, a federal judge in Tennessee had blocked the guidance from being enforced in 20 other states that sued, but the injunction he issued is on hold while the Biden administration appeals.\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to stand by all of its actions and continue to press its case in court. Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights from liberal states are chiming in too. Officials in 15 states and the District of Columbia have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Texas backing the Title IX rule. The court battles are likely to go on for months, perhaps years, and the issue will undoubtedly inform this year's presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "advocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gay News, LGBT Rights, Politics, Entertainment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Green", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edith Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Mink", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patsy Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_Bayh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birch Bayh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Education Amendments of 1972"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Civil_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for Civil Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second-wave feminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bostock v.

Biden's recent rewrite of Title IX includes protection for transgender-identifying people -- a policy that was originally enacted in 1972 to protect women and girls.\n\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti released a statement about the decision, calling it a \"big win.\"\n\n\"This is a big win for the Constitution and the people of Tennessee,\" the statement read. \"We fought hard to protect our constitutional separation of powers, which ensures that the people through their elected representatives are the only authority that can make new laws.\"\n\n\"If the rule we stopped had been allowed to go into effect on August 1 as scheduled, Tennessee schools and universities would have to let boys into girls' locker rooms and other private spaces,\" the statement added. \"If the rule went into effect, our schools would have to punish teachers and students who declined to use someone's preferred pronouns.\"\n\n\"These are profound changes to the law that the American people never agreed to,\" the statement concluded. \"This rule was a huge overreach by federal bureaucrats, and the Court was right to stop it.\"\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares took to X on Monday, celebrating the injunction on what he called the \"unlawful\" move by the Biden administration.\n\n\"I'm pleased to announce that a court has stopped the Biden Administration's unlawful Title IX regulations from going into effect in Virginia,\" Miyares wrote.\n\n\"The Biden Administration's latest power grab would jeopardize half a century of landmark protections for women, violate the First Amendment, and ignore the clear text of the Title IX law passed by Congress,\" he added. \"The rule should have never been issued in the first place.\"\n\nVirginia Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin praised Miyares for leading the charge.\n\n\"Virginians saw the rewriting of Title IX for what it was -- an attempt to leverage federal tax dollars to impose a harmful agenda on parents and families,\" Youngkin wrote. \"I applaud [JasonMiyaresVA] for leading the charge and confronting the Biden administration's obvious executive overreach.\"\n\nFormer collegiate swimmer and outspoken activist for female sports Riley Gaines posted about the court's conclusion and wrote, \"Great news! Biden's illegal rewrite of Title IX won't go into effect in TN, KY, VA, WV, OH, & IN.\"\n\n\"A federal court granted an injunction for the Title IX lawsuit filed by mentioned states,\" Gaines added. \"This is a huge win. The gender ideology house of cards is falling fast.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's provision \"clarifies that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\"\n\nThe revision will force any K-12 school or higher education institution receiving federal funding to allow boys who

Brandi Bradley, a Republican representing part of Douglas County at the state Capitol, called on her supporters to speak against a proposal on the school board's agenda tonight. In a post on X, Bradley said the school board should \"be scared of the parents who will burn them at the stakes,\" if the board approves changes.\n\nThe district's board is set to update its harassment and discrimination policies to match new language in the federal Title IX law, which prohibits schools from discriminating based on sex. The new language, which takes effect on Aug. 1, explicitly protects students against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, pregnancy (or related conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.\n\nDouglas County School District attorney Mary Klimesh told the board that the updates would not constitute much change from existing policies.\n\n\"Colorado law and our policy have included a prohibition on harassment or discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation for some time,\" Klimesh said.\n\nWith the updates to Title IX, trans and non-binary students are protected when using bathrooms and locker rooms that match their identity. The federal government is still in the process of updating Title IX regulations regarding participation in athletics.\n\nSchools that don't abide by the changes risk being sued for violating federal law.\n\nThe changes to Title IX, which was first passed in 1972 to provide equal opportunities in education, have prompted pushback across the country, including legal challenges arguing that the law should only prohibit discrimination based on biological sex.\n\nThose concerns are being echoed in Douglas County ahead of the June 18 school board discussion about updating policies to reflect the new language.\n\nThe Colorado Parent Advocacy Network, a nonprofit that supports parents rights and school choice, started a petition to urge the county school board to delay voting on changing the policy while legal challenges are being worked out.\n\n\"Recent court decisions against Title IX actions taken by the Biden administration suggest that the rules governing these actions are likely to be revised or even revoked,\" the petition says. \"This evolving situation necessitates a thoughtful approach to implementing new policies.\"\n\nThe Douglas County GOP shared the petition and echoed the request to pause the vote. It's unclear how many people have signed the petition.\n\nThe Colorado chapter of Gays Against Groomers, an organization criticized by the Southern Poverty Law Center for amplifying anti-trans rhetoric, called the proposed changes \"dangerous\" and said they would hurt girls in schools.\n\nThose who support the Title IX changes say the new language will help provide a safe and welcoming environment for all students.\n\nNadine Bridges, executive director of One Colorado, a nonprofit that supports the LGBTQ+ community, applauded the Title IX changes in a statement.\n\n\"All students deserve to go to school and have the freedom to learn and be themselves without fear of harassment or discrimination,\" Bridges said. \"The Title IX rule changes help ensure schools are more inclusive and equitable so that all students can succeed.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradocommunitymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Community Media"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Among other things, the regulations force women to share locker rooms and bathrooms with men who claim to be women. They also force schools to allow men pretending to be women to compete against women. This gender-queer ideology is not just controversial, it is adhered to by only a small minority of Americans. Yet the Biden administration purported to find a mandate in a law passed in 1972, when none of these absurdities were dreamed of, to impose it on all of us, whether we like it or not.\n\nNot surprisingly, the courts have been skeptical. Yesterday, federal judge Danny Reeves entered an order that enjoins the Biden administration from enforcing its rule. The case is titled State of Tennessee, et al., v. Miguel Cardona, in his Official Capacity as Secretary of Education, et al. In addition to Tennessee, the states of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia were plaintiffs. You can tell Judge Reeves is on the right track from the first sentence of his opinion:\n\nThere are two sexes: male and female.\n\nAmusingly, this sentence is footnoted. Judge Reeves notes that during oral argument, the lawyer for the Biden administration admitted that it is true. Given the language of Title IX, everything else follows from that admission. But Judge Reeves proceeds with a lengthy exposition of the history of Title IX and the women's movement that gave rise to it. That was a long-forgotten era when you could have a women's movement without a Supreme Court nominee saying that she can't tell you what a woman is.\n\nJudge Reeves's 93-page opinion is a brick by brick deconstruction of the \"trans\" ideology that falls apart upon even a rudimentary review. He concludes:\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was intended to level the playing field between men and women in education. The statute tells us that no person shall be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance \"on the basis of sex.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681. However, the Department of Education seeks to derail deeply rooted law with a Final Rule that is set to go into effect on August 1, 2024.\n\nAt bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining \"sex\" to include \"gender identity.\" But \"sex\" and \"gender identity\" do not mean the same thing. The Department's interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute. ...\n\nThe Final Rule also has serious First Amendment implications. The rule includes a new definition of sexual harassment which may require educators to use pronouns consistent with a student's purported gender identity rather than their biological sex. Based on the \"pervasive\" nature of pronoun usage in everyday life, educators likely would be required to use students' preferred pronouns regardless of whether doing so conflicts with the educator's religious or moral beliefs. A rule that compels speech and engages in such viewpoint discrimination is impermissible.\n\nAdditionally, the Department's actions with respect to this rulemaking are arbitrary and capricious. The Department fails to provide a reasoned explanation for departing from its longstanding interpretations regarding the meaning of sex and provided virtually no answers to many of the difficult questions that arose during the public comment phase. Notably, the Department does not provide a sufficient explanation for leaving regulations in place that conflict with the new gender-identity mandate, nor does it meaningfully respond to commentors' concerns regarding risks posed to student and faculty safety.\n\nSo Judge Reeves enjoined implementation of Biden's new regulations. His injunction extends to the plaintiff states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia. Judge Reeves's order joins another, entered by a federal judge in Louisiana last week, that enjoins enforcement of the Biden regulations in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho.\n\nThese cases are destined for the appellate courts, but a solid record is being created at the trial court level, and the Biden rules are so obviously out of bounds-not a liberal interpretation of Title IX, but rather a reversal of its core purpose-that they are destined to be repudiated. Recent bizarre proceedings in New York and Georgia courts have caused many to wonder whether our judicial system is hopeless, but these rulings indicate that all is not lost.", "source": {"uri":

Women and the courts are pushing back.", "body": "USA TODAY columnist Ingrid Jacques interviews former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Title IX revisions from President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nInflation and immigration are at the top of voters' minds this presidential election year, but there's another issue that deserves your attention: preserving the integrity of women's sports and spaces.\n\nIn an effort to score political points among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, President Joe Biden earlier this year used his executive authority to fundamentally change the point of the Title IX civil rights law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that take federal dollars.\n\nThe 1972 law has been a game changer for women and their access to college sports. Yet, Biden's Title IX rewrite turned the law on its head by prioritizing gender identity over sex - opening the door for transgender athletes in women and girls' sports teams and locker rooms.\n\nThankfully, women athletes and advocates - and now the courts - are standing up to this detrimental development.\n\nOne group of women who care deeply about preserving the original intent of Title IX have hopped on a bus and are touring the country this month to let people know why the issue matters.\n\nTulsi Gabbard is one of those women. The former Democratic U.S. representative turned independent, and potential vice presidential pick of Donald Trump, is part of the bus tour.\n\n\"This should be an important issue for everyone,\" Gabbard told me recently.\n\nGabbard advocated for protecting women's sports when she was in Congress and is still an outspoken defender of fairness for women athletes. She's displeased but not surprised that Biden undermined Title IX in this way.\n\nIt's one of the reasons she's open to being Trump's running mate. Trump has promised to overturn Biden's transgender policies.\n\n\"I want to be in a position to make the most impact on issues of objective truth like this,\" Gabbard said. \"The very first step is to start to fix what has gone terribly wrong.\"\n\nBiden fumbles Title IX: Biden's new Title IX rules bring back 'kangaroo courts.' They will hurt, not help, women.\n\nThese women have a message for Biden: Back off\n\nThe \"Take Back Title IX\" bus tour has crisscrossed the country, targeting states with competitive congressional races. Our Bodies, Our Sports - a coalition of women's advocacy organizations that includes the Independent Women's Forum, the Independent Council on Women's Sports and Concerned Women for America - is hosting the tour.\n\nThe women will head to Washington, D.C., next week to mark the 52nd anniversary of Title IX - and its original intent. They want to send Biden a message.\n\n\"If you have a president, someone who's leading this country, who can't answer what a woman is or denies that there's a clear biological distinction between the sexes, there are no limits, there is nothing that he won't deny,\" Riley Gaines, an ambassador with the Independent Women's Forum and host of OutKick's \"Gaines for Girls\" podcast, told me.\n\nGaines has become a leading proponent for women's sports in the two years since she was forced to compete against collegiate transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.\n\n\"I think it's more than even the implications of what Title IX means specifically as it pertains to sports or colleges, but more broadly what this means about future actions that will be taken if we don't question this,\" Gaines said.\n\nCourts say Biden overreached in Title IX rewrite\n\nBiden's revamped Title IX regulations have garnered numerous lawsuits, and the courts are siding with these concerned women.\n\nIn the past week alone, two federal judges have temporarily halted the implementation of the new rules, affecting 10 states: Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.\n\nWomen sue NCAA: These women say transgender rules discriminate against them. So they're suing the NCAA.\n\nU.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves on Monday ruled that the regulation is \"arbitrary in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\nInternational sports organizations also are siding with keeping women's sports for women. The Court of Arbitration for Sport this month upheld the policy by World Aquatics, the international swimming federation, that prevents transgender athletes who have gone through male puberty from competing in the women's category. Thomas, the transgender swimmer who competed against Gaines, brought the challenge.\n\nFor athletes like Madisan DeBos, a cross-country and track runner at Southern Utah University, these are hopeful developments. Yet, she's still concerned about what could happen if Biden's regulations stay in place.\n\n\"I think that this could lead to no women's sports at all,\" DeBos told me. \"That is extremely disheartening and we work so hard to get to where we are, and I see every single day what athletics have done for not only myself but for my teammates.\n\n\"I've seen the opportunities and the confidence and all of that stuff that is instilled in them, and I think we just are going to take those opportunities away from women if we can't define the difference between a man and a woman.\"\n\nIf Biden isn't wise enough to listen to these women, Trump has made it clear that he will.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

That could only be ultimately resolved by court, but that's what the act was set up to do. So we've asked for the consideration of whether that might apply here, and that will be on the special session call tomorrow,\" Moss said.\n\nFederalism Commission House Chairman Keven Stratton, R-Orem, said he appreciated the board's actions.\n\n\"I was very grateful for the unanimous decision, because I know there's a broad spectrum of ideological perspectives on the board,\" Stratton said.\n\nThe state school board has also allocated $50,000 to hire a contract attorney to help state assistant attorneys general assigned to the board to evaluate \"if and how\" state law is out of compliance with federal law in light of the new Title IX regulations.\n\nThe board also agreed to spend $50,000 to hire an independent auditor to determine how much federal money the board has received in recent years and how much it spends to comply with federal laws.\n\nState School Board vice chairwoman Jennie Earl told commission members that schools want guidance on how to be in legal compliance.\n\n\"With the August 1 deadline coming forward, there is confusion out there,\" she said.\n\nRep. Gay Lynn Bennion, D-Cottonwood Heights, asked Moss and Earl if prior to the Legislature's General Session whether schools around the state had raised concerns about students using restrooms corresponding with their gender identity.\n\n\"I've been on the board for about three and a half years, so I've heard those concerns throughout my time,\" Moss said.\n\nHe continued, \"You've got somebody who says, identify this way, this my sexual orientation. So how do you accommodate that person while protecting others? That's been a challenge throughout my time on the board.\"\n\nMoss said Utah school districts and charter schools have expressed concern about how to proceed.\n\n\"There's state law that very clearly says, 'Do this in order to protect girls in separate space facilities and there's federal law that says 'You can't do that,' \" he said.\n\nHB257 went into effect in January, \"so that has been the law since January. Title IX regulations go into effect August 1. So currently, we've explained to our schools we're under the state law requirements,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Utah has joined three other GOP-led states and four private entities in a lawsuit that challenges the Title IX rules.\n\nThe other plaintiffs include the states of Kansas, Wyoming and Alaska, along with a parent, Shawna Rowland, who filed on behalf of her daughter, K.R.; and three private organizations, Moms for Liberty, Female Athletes United and Young America's Foundation.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Topeka, seeks a declaratory judgment holding that the final rule is unlawful and that plaintiff states are not bound by it.\n\nIt also seeks declarative judgement that does not require \"Title IX recipient's employees or students to use an individual's preferred pronouns or honorifics,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAttorneys general in more than 20 GOP-led states have filed at least seven legal challenges to the new Biden administration policy.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Kentucky temporarily blocked the new Title IX rule in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves referred to the regulation as \"arbitrary in the truest sense of the word\" in granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily blocked the new rule from taking effect in Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.\n\nU.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty called the new rule an \"abuse of power\" and a \"threat to democracy,\" ruling that the Department of Education had overstepped its authority.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The federal court found that \"to allow [the Biden Administration's] unlawful action to stand would be to functionally rewrite Title IX in a way that shockingly transforms American education and usurps a major question from Congress. That is not how our democratic system functions.\"\n\nBecause the court struck down the Biden Administration's unlawful rule, Texas schools do not and should not adopt or enforce any of the policy changes contained in the rule. Texas students are now safe from losing their Title IX protections and the school districts are protected from the threat of the loss of federal funding.\n\nIn the new legal advisory, Attorney General Ken Paxton explained: \"This ruling covers all Texas school districts and ensures no district in our State will have to comply with the Biden Administration's illegitimate interpretation that Title IX includes gender-identity requirements, including allowing men into women's restrooms, locker rooms, sports teams, or requiring students or teachers to use pronouns based on gender identity rather than biological sex. And if any Texas school district adopts a policy or procedure that conflicts with or contravenes state law, then I will pursue every remedy available to protect students and teachers from these illegal and radical policies.\"", "source": {"uri": "texasattorneygeneral.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Attorney General"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/images/2019/PR-Twitter-Card.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663270", "eventUri": "eng-9663270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 267}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

That U.S. law prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs across the nation.\n\nIn April, Louisiana became the first state to file a legal challenge against the Biden's administration's proposed revisions of Title IX, at the instigation of Brumley and Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican.\n\nMurrill was scheduled to speak later at a Heritage Foundation event focused on the Title IX changes headlined by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican.\n\nThe Biden administration's revisions add \"gender identity\" to the list of sex-based protections. Although officials don't include a formal definition of \"gender identity\" in the revised rule, legal experts say it would allow males to participate in girls' and women's sports, use female-only locker rooms and bathrooms, bunk with females in hotel rooms during overnight trips, and more.\n\nLast week, a judge blocked the Title IX rule in Louisiana, as well as in Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho.\n\n\"I am grateful and proud to be able to say that we obtained the first injunction in the country, shortly followed by that issued to the state of Tennessee and another coalition of states, so I expect many more to follow,\" Murrill said at the rally.\n\n\"I think what's unfortunate is that there will be a number of states who remain unprotected,\" the Louisiana attorney general said. \"And so I encourage anyone in those states to reach out to [Alliance Defending Freedom] or other organizations who are willing to fight for them so that they can obtain the same protections that their leaders in those states refuse to provide for them.\"\n\nA religious liberty law firm, Alliance Defending Freedom has filed five lawsuits against the Biden administration's Title IX reinterpretation.\n\nOne of the worst things about the new rule is that in addition to requiring women to change clothes in the same locker room with males, women are threatened by discrimination lawsuits if they speak out, Murrill said.\n\n\"They are punished for complaining about it,\" she said. \"These rules do not just expose us to harm in some of our most private spaces, but they prohibit us from talking about it.\"\n\nLouisiana stands on the side of common sense by challenging the new rule, Brumley said.\n\n\"These reckless changes to Title IX have drawn a clear line in the sand for Louisiana,\" the state's superintendent of schools said, adding that the state also will \"stand on the side of the First Amendment and on the side of equal opportunity under the law.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's reinterpretation of Title IX is contrary to state sovereignty and self-government, Brumley said.\n\n\"If these Title IX changes are enacted, state officials will be required to choose between enforcing their own laws, essentially protecting their own sovereign interest, or violating the federal government's new gender identity mandate and Title IX,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Biden insists, beginning with the upcoming school year, that every public school in America open its girls' restrooms and locker rooms to boys who think they are girls.\n\nMore than half our country - 27 states - have sued to block this policy. Republican states seek to protect girls against this transgender invasion by biological boys, while Democrat politicians controlling the other 23 states promote the trans agenda.\n\nCalifornia cities declare themselves to be sanctuaries for transgenders, and that state's legislature also recently voted to prohibit school district policies of informing parents when their own children try to switch genders. Misnamed the SAFETY Act, AB 1955 is so anti-parent that it would result in schools concealing children's gender confusion from their own parents.\n\nIn five blue states this spring, biological boys won state championships by competing in girls' sports. Biden wants to extend this liberal madness nationwide, by misinterpreting a 1972 law that was intended to protect girls against discrimination in schools: Title IX.\n\nTitle IX states, \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" By redefining \"sex\" to include students' changing views of their own gender, Biden bans any limits by public and charter schools on transgenders.\n\nOn Monday, federal judge Danny C. Reeves in Kentucky held that Biden's new regulation is \"arbitrary in the truest sense of the word,\" and he blocked it in that state plus Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Last Friday another federal judge, in Louisiana, blocked Biden's regulation from being enforced in Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Montana.\n\nThe election of Trump would shut down Biden's lawless push for the trans agenda in our public schools. Trump has campaigned on his commitment to protect girls' sports and locker rooms against boys who think or pretend they are girls.\n\nIn Boston, an all-Democrat panel of the First Circuit held on June 9 that 12-year-old Liam Morrison was properly prohibited by a public school from wearing a t-shirt that said, \"There Are Only Two Genders.\" He was further prevented from wearing that same t-shirt with the words \"Only Two\" covered by a piece of tape on which was written \"CENSORED,\" all of which the court held the school properly banned under its hate speech code.\n\nBut the Northeast and the West Coast do not have the final word on this issue. On June 11, a GOP-appointed federal judge in Fort Worth blocked Biden's transgender school policy for all of Texas.\n\nJudge Reed O'Connor held that the Biden Administration \"lacks authority to redefine 'sex' in a way that conflicts with Title IX.\"\n\nA federal judge in Louisiana, Terry Doughty, held that Biden's analysis wrongly focused on only the effect on transgender students, rather than girls who must then \"use the bathroom, undress, and shower in the presence of persons who may identify as females but still have male biological parts.\" Biden's Department of Education \"made no attempt to determine the effect on students having students who are biologically the opposite sex in their locker rooms and bathrooms.\"\n\nJudge Doughty further held that \"the DOE declared in the Final Rule, with no explanation, that transgender students do not pose a safety risk for cisgender students.\" The newly coined term for the vast majority of children, who are not transgendered, is to call them \"cisgendered.\"\n\nMore good news came last week from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Trump-appointed judges provided the 2-1 majority decision against Biden's pro-transgender policy for schools, as embodied in Biden's 2021 Title IX guidance.\n\nThis appellate decision protects 20 red states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Additional states, including Florida, Utah, and Wyoming, have filed lawsuits within their own jurisdictions.\n\nMidwestern states, including Iowa and North Dakota, have sued in St. Louis within the conservative Eighth Circuit, and other lawsuits including Texas and Virginia mentioned above round out the total of 27. Prior rulings by the more liberal Fourth and Seventh Circuits held that there is a transgender right of access to girls' restrooms under both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\n\nWhile some expect the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the widening divide in our country on this issue, that Court remains unwilling to get involved. Instead, it will be the upcoming presidential election that determines whether gender-confused boys will invade schoolgirls' restrooms, locker rooms, and sports competitions.", "source": {"uri":

The Court's decision is a victory for state sovereignty and all who believe young women deserve safe spaces at school.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit that Drummond filed against the DOE earlier this year, the Attorney General argued that the agency's proposed Title IX final rule is unfair to female athletes. That filing criticized the Biden Administration for its unlawful attempt to transform Title IX.\n\n\"In doing so, it attempts to rewrite Title IX, it ignores the literal text of the statute and the purpose behind its creation, it disregards the lack of public support for the proposed rule, and it jeopardizes the equal opportunity that has been afforded to female athletes ever since the establishment of the statute,\" reads that May filing.\n\n\"The Department attempts to make these drastic and detrimental changes while relying on a Supreme Court case that has no connection to Title IX. Perhaps worst of all, implementation of the Final Rule would serve to isolate and deny the group of athletes that the statute was originally designed to promote and protect -- female athletes.\"\n\nThat lawsuit details how the radical rewriting of Title IX harms female students.\n\n\"Students of both sexes will experience violations of their bodily privacy by students of a different sex,\" reads the lawsuit. \"Indeed, the Final Rule also ignores psychological and safety concerns. For instance, a recent study points out that 'limited research has explored girls' experiences of competing on boys' sports teams,' noting unique challenges to female athletes. ... Female athletes describe 'having to navigate tensions and problematic assumptions of girls' inferiority in sport.' Meanwhile, research shows that female athletes are more willing to participate in single-sex athletics and less likely to feel self-conscious in single-sex athletics.\"", "source": {"uri": "legalnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legal Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "legal_newsline@legalnewsline.com", "name": "Legal Newsline", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentner_Drummond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gentner Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Sixth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrative Procedure Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sex_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-sex education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/0e/45/16691662/webp_o32qdc7cuk07xgn2lfxgjpqhsqf2.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663270", "eventUri": "eng-9663270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 520, "textEnd": 527}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 22}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Women and the courts are pushing back.", "body": "Inflation and immigration are at the top of voters' minds this presidential election year, but there's another issue that deserves your attention: preserving the integrity of women's sports and spaces.\n\nIn an effort to score political points among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, President Joe Biden earlier this year used his executive authority to fundamentally change the point of the Title IX civil rights law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that take federal dollars.\n\nThe 1972 law has been a game changer for women and their access to college sports. Yet, Biden's Title IX rewrite turned the law on its head by prioritizing gender identity over sex - opening the door for transgender athletes in women and girls' sports teams and locker rooms.\n\nThankfully, women athletes and advocates - and now the courts - are standing up to this detrimental development.\n\nOne group of women who care deeply about preserving the original intent of Title IX have hopped on a bus and are touring the country this month to let people know why the issue matters.\n\nTulsi Gabbard is one of those women. The former Democratic U.S. representative turned independent, and potential vice presidential pick of Donald Trump, is part of the bus tour.\n\n\"This should be an important issue for everyone,\" Gabbard told me recently.\n\nGabbard advocated for protecting women's sports when she was in Congress and is still an outspoken defender of fairness for women athletes. She's displeased but not surprised that Biden undermined Title IX in this way.\n\nIt's one of the reasons she's open to being Trump's running mate. Trump has promised to overturn Biden's transgender policies.\n\n\"I want to be in a position to make the most impact on issues of objective truth like this,\" Gabbard said. \"The very first step is to start to fix what has gone terribly wrong.\"\n\nBiden fumbles Title IX: Biden's new Title IX rules bring back 'kangaroo courts.' They will hurt, not help, women.\n\nThe \"Take Back Title IX\" bus tour has crisscrossed the country, targeting states with competitive congressional races. Our Bodies, Our Sports - a coalition of women's advocacy organizations that includes the Independent Women's Forum, the Independent Council on Women's Sports and Concerned Women for America - is hosting the tour.\n\nThe women will head to Washington, D.C., next week to mark the 52nd anniversary of Title IX - and its original intent. They want to send Biden a message.\n\n\"If you have a president, someone who's leading this country, who can't answer what a woman is or denies that there's a clear biological distinction between the sexes, there are no limits, there is nothing that he won't deny,\" Riley Gaines, an ambassador with the Independent Women's Forum and host of OutKick's \"Gaines for Girls\" podcast, told me.\n\nGaines has become a leading proponent for women's sports in the two years since she was forced to compete against collegiate transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.\n\n\"I think it's more than even the implications of what Title IX means specifically as it pertains to sports or colleges, but more broadly what this means about future actions that will be taken if we don't question this,\" Gaines said.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nBiden's revamped Title IX regulations have garnered numerous lawsuits, and the courts are siding with these concerned women.\n\nIn the past week alone, two federal judges have temporarily halted the implementation of the new rules, affecting 10 states: Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.\n\nWomen sue NCAA: These women say transgender rules discriminate against them. So they're suing the NCAA.\n\nU.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves on Monday ruled that the regulation is \"arbitrary in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\nInternational sports organizations also are siding with keeping women's sports for women. The Court of Arbitration for Sport this month upheld the policy by World Aquatics, the international swimming federation, that prevents transgender athletes who have gone through male puberty from competing in the women's category. Thomas, the transgender swimmer who competed against Gaines, brought the challenge.\n\nFor athletes like Madisan DeBos, a cross-country and track runner at Southern Utah University, these are hopeful developments. Yet, she's still concerned about what could happen if Biden's regulations stay in place.\n\n\"I think that this could lead to no women's sports at all,\" DeBos told me. \"That is extremely disheartening and we work so hard to get to where we are, and I see every single day what athletics have done for not only myself but for my teammates.\n\n\"I've seen the opportunities and the confidence and all of that stuff that is instilled in them, and I think we just are going to take those opportunities away from women if we can't define the difference between a man and a woman.\"\n\nIf Biden isn't wise enough to listen to these women, Trump has made it clear that he will.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Williams was joined by board members Tim Moore, Becky Myers and Kaylee Winegar to table the changes.\n\nThe new language in Title IX, which was first passed in 1972 to prohibit discrimination based on sex, protects students against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, pregnancy (or related conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. The federal changes take effect on Aug. 1 and the school board's discussion of changes was set to align with that deadline.\n\nThe updates to Title IX mean trans and non-binary students are protected when using bathrooms and locker rooms that match their identity. The federal government is still in the process of updating Title IX regulations regarding participation in athletics.\n\nSchools that don't abide by the changes risk being sued for violating federal law.\n\nAdditionally, the Colorado legislature passed a law in 2023, Senate Bill 23-296, which requires school districts to implement a discrimination and harassment policy separate from Title IX policies by July 1. District staff said it's unclear what the consequences are for not meeting the deadline.\n\nDouglas County School District attorney Mary Klimesh previously told the board that the updates would not constitute much change from existing policies.\n\n\"Colorado law and our policy have included a prohibition on harassment or discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation for some time,\" Klimesh said.\n\nPaula Hans, a spokesperson for the district, said the district would continue to enforce its current discrimination and harassment policies while the proposed changes are tabled.\n\nSeveral public commenters at the meeting thanked the board for tabling the changes and some pushed the district to go further.\n\nMartha Carver, a representative for Grandparents for Kids, urged the school district to give up federal funding so the district could ignore federal education regulations.\n\n\"We recommend that the school district reject federal money, thus avoid having to comply with federal changes,\" Carver said.\n\nFormer school board member Jason Page said he would rather the district get rid of all sports than for it to allow trans students to play on the team that matches their gender identity.\n\n\"If push comes to shove, a great way to not deal with Title IX is to just remove athletics from the district so if that's where we need to go, respectfully, I say let's just remove sports,\" Page said.\n\nA few commenters shared disappointment with the board's decision to delay the changes.\n\n\"Trans people are not inherently dangerous, but they are in danger,\" Kathleen Boyer said. \"They are in danger because of words spoken at meetings like this, in public and on social media. The permission given by adults in this community and around the country to target and dehumanize them and delegitimize their experiences leads to direct bullying and harassment.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradocommunitymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Community Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mckenna_harford@coloradocommunitymedia.com", "name": "McKenna Harford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Title IX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Moore_(North_Carolina_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Moore (North Carolina politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender expression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carver_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carver County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carver County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Academic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/coloradocommunitymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20220211-124729-douglas20county20school20district.jpg?fit=1500%2C1125&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663270", "eventUri": "eng-9663270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1643, "textEnd": 1649}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2274, "textEnd": 2280}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., weighs in on six more states blocking President Biden's Title IX expansion, responds to New York Magazine piece criticizing Republican women.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said she \"laughed all the way through\" a widely criticized New York Magazine piece attacking conservative women, blasting it as proof liberals want to \"erase the lines of gender.\"\n\nNew York Magazine published a cover story Monday that criticized Republican women, depicting them holding guns in MAGA hats asking, \"Are Republican women okay?\" Blackburn said the story is simply the latest example of liberals not respecting women.\n\n\"I laughed all the way through this article, because I thought, 'The left absolutely requires submission of women to their ideology,'\" Blackburn said Tuesday on \"America's Newsroom.\"\n\n6 STATES HALT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S TITLE IX REWRITE AFTER WEST VIRGINIA ATHLETE'S LAWSUIT\n\nThe New York Magazine article by Rebecca Traister said, \"On the cusp of an election season that could further reshape this democracy and women's place within it, the questions facing the women of the Republican right are tricky. Are they supposed to be cutthroat or cute? Cold enough to kill a dog or warm enough to bake an apple pie?\"\n\nThe story, which features an accompanying photo of South Carolina Gov. Kristi Noem and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene blended together, also asked if GOP women should devote their attention to country, husband, God or Trump before declaring, \"Women fundamentally cannot lead a party that wants to oppress women; they cannot, in fact, be fully human within it.\"\n\nBlackburn said people on the left can't stand \"strong\" and \"conservative\" women.\n\n\"Their goal is to really erase the lines of gender, and they would love to be able to do that,\" Blackburn said.\n\n\"They require that you submit, and if you ever challenge them, if you ever push back on them, then they are going to cut you out,\" she added. \"They cannot stand strong, conservative, independent-minded women who really like being female, who really like being a mom, who really like being a woman.\"\n\nBlackburn said traditional roles for women don't fit the modern left's \"template.\"\n\n\"They are the Stepford Wives of the leftist ideology,\" she said. \"You have to come right into lockstep, you cannot deviate if you're going to be a female leader on the left.\"\n\nA spokesperson for New York Magazine told Fox News Digital the outlet stands by its story.\n\nMany others took to X to mock the magazine:\n\nFLASHBACK: WEST VIRGINIA TRANSGENDER SPORTS BAN OVERTURNED IN FEDERAL APPEALS COURT\n\nBlackburn also criticized President Biden's Title IX expansion, saying the administration is continuing its assault on opportunities for young women.\n\nA U.S. district court in Kentucky on Monday ordered the Biden administration to halt the implementation of its new Title IX protections after a West Virginia girl and Christian Educators Association International sued in response to a transgender teen being allowed to compete on a middle school team.\n\n\"I was pleased to see this because Tennessee is one of those states,\" Blackburn said. \"Title IX, is there to protect girls and women in sports.\"\n\n\"For 50 years, Title IX has allowed girls to compete, to excel to get college scholarships, to learn about team building and to develop those skills that are going to help them all of their lives,\" she continued. \"The Biden administration continues to try to diminish that and to take those opportunities away from young girls and young women.\"\n\nThe new injunction applies to Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to Tennessee. A federal judge blocked Biden's Title IX rule in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho last week.\n\nTitle IX is a longstanding civil rights law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in schools and other education centers that receive federal funding. Under the Biden administration's new rules, sex discrimination would include discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "source":

I hope you're getting some time off from the daily hustle and bustle of your districts. It's been a slow week in the edu-sphere, but we've highlighted several topics you should read up on if you haven't already, including Title IX.\n\nTitle IX gets blocked\n\nThere's new controversy surrounding the Biden administration's newest Title IX regulations. Earlier this week, a federal judge blocked the updated rules in six conservative states: Tennesee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nThe lawsuit claims an \"attempt by the executive branch to dramatically alter the purpose and meaning of Title IX through rulemaking,\" the document reads. The plaintiffs also argue that the new text redefines sex to include gender identity, violating First Amendment rights as a \"result of arbitrary and capricious rulemaking.\"\n\nThis decision comes after a slew of education leaders in several states, including Florida, Texas, Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina, publicly advised school districts not to comply with the new Title IX ruling.\n\n\"You have rewritten Title IX to force schools to treat boys as if they were girls and to accept every student's self-declared gender identity,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote in a letter to President Biden. \"This ham-handed effort to impose a leftist belief onto Title IX exceeds your authority as president.\"\n\nThe issue with cell phones and social media\n\nIn other news, more states are considering banning cell phones in their schools just as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her vision to restrict student use of personal devices. The Los Angeles Unified School District just approved the nation's largest districtwide cellphone ban, which takes effect in January. Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho also pointed to the negative effects of social media.\n\n\"When coupled with social media, phones are a harmful vehicle that negatively impacts young people,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe entire state of California may soon follow, too. Gov. Gavin Newsom told Politico he intends to work with state lawmakers to \"severely restrict\" phones in public schools. You can read District Administration's Matt Zalaznick's coverage here.\n\nMore from DA: 2 big reasons teachers say they lag in workforce\n\nAlso topping national headlines, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is advocating for warning labels on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X and Snapchat. In an op-ed published in The New York Times, he writes that the mental health crisis among America's youth is an emergency, and social media is a primary contributor. You can read my coverage about it here.\n\nNew from DA and FETC\n\nWe're continuing to showcase the recipients of DA's \"Top 100 Influencers in Education\" award. You can read up on your colleagues by accessing the list -- which receives updates weekly -- here.\n\nYou should also catch DA's latest \"Talking Out of School\" podcast where we discuss why K12 branding and marketing is so important for engaging with your community, especially as education issues become more politicized. You can listen to that episode here.\n\nAI news\n\nAnd now it's time for your weekly scoop on what's new in the world of artificial intelligence. On Thursday, the Future of Education Technology Conference's Jennifer Womble hosted a free webinar showcasing 10 AI-powered edtech tools educators can use in their classrooms. If you missed it, you can always register afterward to receive the recording via email.\n\nFinally, I've pointed to a couple of surveys surrounding AI in K12 that you should definitely breeze over. You'll gain valuable insight into what students, teachers, parents and other stakeholders think about AI's growing role in education:", "source": {"uri": "districtadministration.com", "dataType":

DFI President Bob Eitel is a graduate of Ben Franklin High School in New Orleans and of Tulane Law School.\n\nThe court's injunction bars the rule from being implemented in those four states. Similar suits are sure to see at least interim success in other states, and the controversy is almost certain to wind its way to the U.S. Supreme Court before long.\n\nThe brief filed by DFI and the four states is strongly worded. Appropriately so. They write that the rule's \"consequences will be shocking and severe. Boys and girls will be forced to share bathrooms, locker rooms, and perhaps even lodging on overnight field trips with members of the opposite sex. Adding insult to injury, they will be forced to use 'preferred pronouns' or else face punishment, which raises distinct Free Speech and Free Exercise [of religion] problems.\"\n\nThe rule also could be used to bolster the practice of schools hiding from parents the fact that their minor children are receiving \"gender-affirming\" counseling.\n\nLegally, the rule extends regulatory powers beyond all propriety. Nowhere did Congress pass and a president sign a law that said \"gender identity\" is protected. Biden's bureaucrats essentially added those new words to the law, and in doing so completely upended the entire purpose of Title IX. The point of Title IX was to recognize distinctions between the sexes and to provide protections to girls and women based on those distinctions. Instead, the new rule erases all those distinctions at the whim of gender transitioners or of school officials who encourage them, at the direct disadvantage and loss of privacy of the biological women and girls it is meant to protect.\n\nIndeed, Title IX's actual language notes that \"nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit\" educational institutions \"from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.\" Biden's rule instead does the exact opposite, meaning institutions will be punished if they do try to keep separate living facilities that exclude biological men from women's quarters. The Biden rule runs directly counter to congressional intent: When passing Title IX, Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Indiana, specifically said it \"permit[s] differential treatment by sex... in sports facilities or other instances where personal privacy must be preserved.\"\n\nFor all these reasons and more, the Biden administration is legally so far in the wrong as to be outrageous. It will almost surely lose if the issue reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, too, Biden is wrong. The American College of Pediatricians, a conservative advocacy group, earlier this month issued a \"declaration\" refuting the idea that \"gender identity\" and \"sex\" are at all the same thing and blasting the practice of encouraging gender transitions. Joined by numerous other medical groups and leading physicians, the declaration said that recognition of the \"innate differences\" between the two sexes \"is critical to the practice of good medicine and to the development of sound public policy.\"\n\nOfficial policy in the U.K., Sweden, Finland, Norway and France now follows this growing medical consensus that gender transitions for children are in most cases not appropriate.\n\nIn sum, the Biden administration is wrong legally, medically and ethically. Its June 13 loss in a Louisiana case ought to be the first of many such defeats, until it withdraws the unwarranted and flat-out dangerous rule.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news",

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY - Oklahoma's top attorney celebrated a court decision that blocks the Biden administration from redefining Title IX.\n\nThe U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Education's attempt to include sexual orientation and gender identity in Title IX was invalid. The court ruled the Administrative Procedures Act was likely violated because the U.S. Department of Education did not adhere to required notice-and-comment rules.\n\nThe ruling will maintain Oklahoma law that requires schools and universities to provide separate bathrooms, locker rooms and sports based on sex assigned at birth, said Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Oklahoma is among over a dozen states that ban transgender girls and women from participating in female sports.\n\nTwenty states, including Oklahoma, filed legal challenges against the Biden administration's new rules, which seek to prohibit discrimination against gender identity and sexual orientation in education activities and programs that receive federal aid.\n\nAfter a federal district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the rules from taking effect Aug. 1, the federal Department of Education asked the Sixth Circuit Court to reverse the ruling.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit ruling applies to all 20 states that have challenged the provision.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the decision will protect female students.\n\n\"I am thankful that the Biden Administration will not be allowed to completely rewrite Title IX with its misplaced gender policy,\" Drummond said in a statement. \"Oklahoma schools and universities should not be penalized for following state law that protects female students on the athletic field, as well as in bathrooms and locker rooms. The Court's decision is a victory for state sovereignty and all who believe young women deserve safe spaces at school.\"\n\nIn April, state Superintendent Ryan Walters instructed Oklahoma's public schools to ignore the updated federal regulations.

Bill Cassidy shares Louisiana stories on flood Insurance on the Senate floor Monday night. (Special to the American Press)\n\nDuring a reporter conference call on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., discussed the Dismantle DEI Act.\n\nCassidy introduced the legislation last Wednesday alongside U.S. Sens. J.S. Vance, R-Ohio; Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.; Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.; Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.; Rick Scott, R-Fla; and several U.S. congressmen.\n\nThis legislation aims to pull all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and eliminate funding for federal and educational accreditation agencies that receive funding to institute DEI programs.\n\nDEI initiatives are implemented to create equitable workplace and educational spaces for marginalized communities, including non-White workers, women and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nCassidy said DEI programs \"as being practiced is institutionalizing discrimination in hiring.\"\n\n\"As a taxpayer, I expect the most qualified candidate to be hired, not the most favored,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has instituted DEI programs in most federal agencies, Cassidy said.\n\nThe Dismantle DEI Act would also lead to the termination of chief diversity officers, close DEI offices, end DEI and critical race theory training and outlaw mandatory employee DEI pledges.\n\n\"It's time to get back to hiring the best, not the person who checks the most boxes.\"\n\nTitle IX\n\nDuring the same conference call, Cassidy condemned the Biden administration's efforts to institute new Title IX rules that expand the meaning of prohibited sex discrimination to add protections for transgender, non-binary and gender nonconforming students.\n\nTitle IX is a federal statue that prohibits sex discrimination in educational facilities that receive federal funding.\n\n\"For over 50 years, Title IX has promoted participation and equality for women and girls in American education and sports,\" Cassidy said. \"It ensures that women have a fair shake relative to treatment men historically received.\"\n\nThe new policies would \"coerce schools to allow biological males to compete in women's sports or risk losing federal funds,\" he said, and would require \"institutions to allow biological males into female spaces\" -- including bathrooms and locker rooms.\n\nCassidy believes the expansion of the definition of sexual harassment to include misgendering and \"replace sex with gender identity\" is \"injecting progressive gender ideology that removes long-standing protections for women and girls\" into Title IX.\n\n\"This will be the death of Title IX as we know it.\"\n\nIn April, several states, including Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the new Title IX rules. Last week, U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty ordered to temporarily block the rule Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho, calling the Title IX rule an \"abuse of power\" and \"threat to democracy.\"\n\nCassidy expects the ruling to be litigated.\n\n\"The Biden administration won't give it up, but republicans are leading the charge to oppose President Biden's Title IX effort.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com", "dataType":

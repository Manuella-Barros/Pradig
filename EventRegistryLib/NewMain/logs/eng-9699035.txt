Rides are also confidential. To request a tow truck, people can call 855-286-9246.\n\nThe program is meant to prevent drinking and driving, giving people a chance to get somewhere safe if they have been drinking during the holiday. Appointments cannot be made ahead of time -- the program is meant to be a safety net for people who did not plan ahead.\n\nAAA said people should choose a designated driver before drinking or taking drugs, or use a ride-sharing service to get home. But if those plans fall through, AAA offers the Tow to Go program to prevent injuries and deaths that could result from drinking and driving.\n\nIn some situations, AAA said it may need to make other arrangements to help an impaired person get home safely. It also said the program may not be available in rural areas, or during severe weather.\n\nAAA expects to help around 800,000 drivers across the U.S. with car trouble during the week of Independence Day. The Tow to Go program has helped around 30,000 drivers since 1998. It is also available in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, the Denver area, the Charlotte area and the Fort Wayne and South Bend areas of Indiana.\n\nThe program is also usually offered during holidays like Labor Day, St. Patrick's Day and Memorial Day.", "source": {"uri": "wbir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wbir.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

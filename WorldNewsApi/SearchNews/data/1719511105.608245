{"id": 223813344, "title": "A social media ban won\u2019t keep my teenagers safe \u2013 it just takes away the place they love", "text": "In the olden days, I sat in front of an enormous CRT monitor and waited for my 14400 baud modem to connect. For a few hours, I talked to my friends via internet relay chat (\u201conline\u201d). When I was finished, I stood up, left the family room and hung out with my cats (\u201coffline\u201d). The distinction between online and off has changed a lot since then. Relationships moved from LiveJournal to IRL. We had to use email for work. Banks closed their physical branches in favour of apps. Slowly but surely, our \u201conline life\u201d just became life. Society now straddles the two worlds, with the same terrible people gathering in both dog parks and neighbourhood Facebook groups. Australian governments have this week shown an almost touching naivety about this. They\u2019re worried about young people\u2019s vulnerability to \u201charmful content\u201d \u2013 which might include everything from violence and gambling to hate speech and videos of former US presidents \u2013 and their proposed solution is to simply remove \u201conline\u201d from young people and thus protect them. I\u2019m a parent and social media strategist who\u2019s been risking her life via the internet since the 90s. My kids are chronically online, a fact of which I\u2019m both proud and horrified. First things first: at some level, this discussion is moot. Teenagers will get around a social media ban. A huge proportion of their parents lack the technical literacy to even know what their kids are doing on their devices. Parental controls? Smoke and mirrors. A ban is merely a blip. We climbed out of windows to drink booze in a park; Gen Alpha will get a VPN so they can watch Crunchyroll. Who is going to stop these kids? You? Me? Chris Minns making daily house calls after dinner? But let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that a blanket ban is possible. My question to these governments is: why do you hate teenagers? As in every generational gap since the beginning of time, kids themselves are much less worried about this than their parents. There are undeniable undertones in this proposal of \u201ckids these days are always on their phones/have no practical skills/are rude to grownups\u201d. The wide-eyed panic about how much time kids spend on social media is loud but not really backed by robust science. There are issues that warrant real concern. Kids are being radicalised via extremist content. They have easy access via social platforms to porn, gambling and Alex Jones. Some platforms are gateways for predators, and the majority of Gen Zers haven\u2019t learned internet safety skills in the same way we did (through terrifying videos of cartoon cats being sucked into laptops). Cyberbullying is rife and anonymity protects the cruel. Let\u2019s unpack that. Australia introduced online bullying laws in 1995 \u2013 before most of us even had the internet. For all that time, it\u2019s been illegal to use it to threaten, harass, stalk, intimidate or defame someone. And, just like any ban on behaviour, people do it anyway, with varying degrees of consequence. The platforms are doing very little to stop it. In 2022, an American mother sued Meta and Snapchat for \u201cfailing to provide adequate safeguards\u201d, which she feels resulted in her 11-year-old daughter\u2019s suicide. That case reflects social media\u2019s problematic foundations: dorks like me going online to either make friends or viciously gossip about girls who don\u2019t like them. The platforms determine and are hamstrung by cultural dynamics. The way they\u2019re used is rapidly reshaped by those who use them, as they adapt the functionality to their particular social media dialect. Unfortunately, the platforms have little obligation to fix this. For example, since Elon Musk\u2019s purchase \u2013 and then decimation \u2013 of Twitter/X in 2022, spam bots have taken over. There is less adult content in a literal sex shop. In some cases, platforms encourage it. Research shows that YouTube\u2019s algorithm, for example, reinforces extremist ideas by promoting videos from \u201cproblematic channels\u201d. The issue here isn\u2019t the age of the users but of the platforms\u2019 wilful provision of harmful content and the government\u2019s failure to hold them to account. But there\u2019s one other important complexity. There are myriad places young people can gather online, from Discord servers and WhatsApp groups to fanfic communities and Buffy the Vampire Slayer forums. The internet is \u2013 still \u2013 a place for like-minded people to talk to each other about common interests, to find and nurture community (even if some of them are a bit weird). I haven\u2019t yet mentioned my worries for my own kids, and the truth is that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have many. A study published in the Conversation found that while kids and parents think age limits could make the internet safer, young people see it more as something that benefits adults. And sure, their frontal cortexes aren\u2019t yet fully developed, but what the internet has always done is give kids agency. As the adult, I\u2019ve made sure I remain as educated as possible on the risks. I\u2019ve taught my kids how to identify a scam, explained why porn is not real life and asked them to please not share their address with anyone. Besides, they\u2019ve grown up with it. Hell, I grew up with it. Just as \u201cmillennials\u201d are actually 40 years old, so too has social media existed for decades. The government\u2019s blanket ban doesn\u2019t allow for this nuance. It doesn\u2019t see the kids who live in homes where queerness is shameful, or who find respite from domestic violence, or who are simply lonely. \u201cOnline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d are not two different places; what we teach to and learn about our kids will apply to how they handle themselves in every situation in this murky, bionic existence where digital and analogue are intertwined. They depend on us for their safety \u2013 not by taking their spaces away, but by making them better spaces.", "summary": "<p>Even with a ban, Gen Alpha will find a way to connect with people online.

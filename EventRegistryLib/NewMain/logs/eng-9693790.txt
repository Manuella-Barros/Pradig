ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to report the news.\n\nBleacher Report's Chris Haynes adds that the Sixers will be a \"legitimate threat\" to sign George.\n\nThe best-case scenario for the Sixers was George declining his $48.7 million player option for the 2024-25 season. Now the team has the chance to woo the six-time All-NBA pick in free agency and offer him a four-year, $212 million max deal -- one the Clippers have been reportedly unwilling to offer.\n\nGeorge could've opted into his current deal and potentially been traded to the Warriors, who were reportedly ready to offer him a max contract. As we learned with the James Harden saga last year, these types of situations can linger. It's also fair to note that LA could've played hardball here, not wanting to help Golden State in their quest to get Steph Curry another ring (anyone who still has PTSD from the Jimmy Butler sign-and-trade should get that).\n\nSo, what now?\n\nExpect the Sixers to roll out the red carpet for George when free agency begins at 6 p.m. Sunday night. Geography is not the Sixers' friend here as all indications are that the nine-time All-Star wing has a strong desire to stay on the West Coast with his family. It will be up to the team to convince the Palmdale native that moving across the country to partner with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey is the right move.\n\nSo, what happens if they whiff on PG-13?\n\nWell, Brandon Ingram is still a Pelican even after New Orleans dealt for Hawks' guard Dejounte Murray Friday night. While it still feels like a long shot, there's a chance the Jazz could trade All-Star Lauri Markkanen -- and the Sixers would be well positioned to give Utah its best offer. In free agency, they could pivot to elite role players, like Denver's Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nFree agency begins at 6 p.m. Sunday when teams are free to negotiate with free agents.

Wojnarowski added that George will be setting up meetings with the Clippers and other teams with the requisite cap space to sign him on Sunday night.\n\nAccording to Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report and TNT, the Sixers are planning to \"aggressively pursue\" George and are a \"legitimate threat\" to the Clippers.\n\nPart of the appeal of George, 34, is that his skillset should enable him to fit seamlessly on just about any roster, especially a Sixers team that already includes a dynamic All-Star duo of Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. He is one of the best three-point shooters on the wing in recent NBA history, has averaged at least 20 points per game in each of his last 10 full NBA seasons and has a reputation as one of the best wing defenders of his era.\n\nThe Sixers have the ability to create upwards of $50 million in cap space this summer, and as a player with more than 10 years of NBA services, George's maximum contract starts at $49.3 million.

Now the team has the chance to woo the six-time All-NBA pick in free agency and offer him a four-year, $212 million max deal -- one the Clippers have been reportedly unwilling to offer.\n\nGeorge could've opted into his current deal and potentially been traded to the Warriors, who were reportedly ready to offer him a max contract. As we learned with the James Harden saga last year, these types of situations can linger. It's also fair to note that LA could've played hardball here, not wanting to help Golden State in their quest to get Steph Curry another ring (anyone who still has PTSD from the Jimmy Butler sign-and-trade should get that).\n\nSo, what now?\n\nExpect the Sixers to roll out the red carpet for George when free agency begins at 6 p.m. Sunday night. Geography is not the Sixers' friend here as all indications are that the nine-time All-Star wing has a strong desire to stay on the West Coast with his family. It will be up to the team to convince the Palmdale native that moving across the country to partner with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey is the right move.\n\nSo, what happens if they whiff on PG-13?\n\nWell, Brandon Ingram is still a Pelican even after New Orleans dealt for Hawks' guard Dejounte Murray Friday night. While it still feels like a long shot, there's a chance the Jazz could trade All-Star Lauri Markkanen -- and the Sixers would be well positioned to give Utah its best offer.

He's now poised to take free-agent meetings with the Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic after the new league year begins at 6 p.m. ET Sunday, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThose might now be his only three realistic options thanks to his decision to opt out. That bodes well for the Sixers, whom Chris Haynes of TNT Sports described as a \"legitimate threat\" to sign George this offseason.\n\nThe Clippers signed Kawhi Leonard to a three-year, roughly $150 million extension in January, and they've reportedly been offering George the same contract for months. George reportedly wants his full four-year, $221 million maximum contract, but the Clippers haven't been willing to cave on the fourth year as of yet.\n\nThe Sixers, who can create more than $60 million in cap space this summer, would have no problem fitting his $49.4 million maximum salary on their books for next season. In fact, they could have as much as $13.15 million in cap space after signing George to a max deal, plus the $8.0 million room mid-level exception.\n\nThe Magic can easily create $50-plus million in cap space as well, but going much beyond that would require waiving Jonathan Isaac and his $17.4 million non-guaranteed contract. They would still have Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs, Wendell Carter Jr. Cole Anthony, Anthony Black and Jett Howard -- all of whom were top-15 picks within the past six years -- but they'd be largely capped out after adding George, barring other moves.\n\nTea leaves suggest the Sixers are George's most likely landing spot if he decides to leave the Clippers. The question now comes down to whether the Sixers actually offer him the full four-year, $212 million contract that they've been telegraphing for weeks.\n\nIf so, do the Clippers move their offer up at all, or do they hold firm at three years and $150 million? What happens then? Does George pass up the extra $62 million to stay at home in L.A., or does he head East to chase championships with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey? (With his pockets lined slightly more, of course.)\n\nAs that dynamic plays out, the rest of the league could decide to move right along with free agency in the meantime. If so, the Sixers and Magic will have to weigh how long they're willing to reserve their cap space for a run at George before pivoting elsewhere. The Sixers could get especially ravaged if other teams sign the likes of De'Anthony Melton, Buddy Hield and Nicolas Batum while they wait for George's decision.\n\nIt might be worth the wait for the Sixers, as league sources \"believe Philly is the front-runner\" to acquire George, according to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Not only that, but \"if he comes to Philly, sources believe George will help recruit solid role players for the Sixers' pursuit of an NBA championship-caliber roster.\"\n\nHe likely wouldn't have to go very far to begin in that regard. George played with Batum, Robert Covington and KJ Martin on the Clippers before they headed to Philadelphia in the James Harden trade early last season. All three finished out the season with the Sixers and are now free agents.\n\nDuring a recent episode of his Podcast P with Paul George, George spoke about how much the Clippers missed those three after the trade:\n\n\"We lost RoCo. We lost Nico. Those were our glue guys. Like, that was our defenders. ... KJ Martin as well. That was our energy, our young legs. I think that's kind of where you get to late in the year and we just weren't as good as we could have been. I think losing those guys kind of hurt us. ...\n\n\"They would go get rebounds, they would block shots, they would rotate. They were defensive guys. ... They did a lot of the dirty work. ... Now myself, Kawhi [Leonard], we become the dirty guys and have to score too. And it was just a lot.\"\n\nIf the Sixers do manage to sign George, the success of the George-Maxey-Embiid trio may depend as much upon their ensuing moves as it does those three. If they're able to convince Batum, Covington and Martin to stay on below-market-value contracts, that could help them spend the room MLE and at least some of their cap space elsewhere. The same goes for Melton and Kyle Lowry, the latter of whom seems far more likely to return for cheap than the former.\n\nIf they're forced to scramble and largely fill out their roster with minimum-salary signings from other teams, the Phoenix Suns' inconsistent results from last offseason don't bode well in that regard.\n\nIn the meantime, the Sixers should hope that George effectively holds up the rest of the free-agent and trade market while he makes his decision. Other teams and free agents could look to exploit the desperation of whichever teams lose out in the George sweepstakes, particularly since the league's new salary-floor rules effectively force cap-space teams to spend big and spend quickly.\n\nWhatever George decides to do will have major domino effects for the rest of the NBA. If he spurns the Sixers, they could suddenly have more than $60 million in cap space burning a hole in their pocket. (Luckily, they won't be short on alternatives.) But if they do land him, they'll then have to pivot to rounding out the rest of their roster on the cheap.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Batum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Batum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Isaac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Isaac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Banchero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Banchero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Wagner_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franz Wagner (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Suggs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Suggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Anthony_Melton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De'Anthony Melton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Carter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wendell Carter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Covington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Covington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66061f60ac3d195de7453a5a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693790", "eventUri": "eng-9693790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Clippers can offer George a four-year, $221 million maximum salary deal, but weren't willing to give him more than three years, $152.3 million. But the Sixers and other teams can offer four years, $212 million.\n\n\" READ MORE: Source: Sixers decline Jeff Dowtin's deal for next season\n\nSources believe Philly is the frontrunner to acquire the 6-foot-8, 220-pounder. However, the Orlando Magic, another potential destination, cleared up available cap space to offer the max. And you have to wonder if he'll remain in Los Angeles if the Clippers give into his demands for a fourth year.\n\nThe nine-time All-Star will meet with the Sixers, Magic, and Clippers shortly after free agency begins at 6 p.m. Sunday.\n\nGeorge has long been the Sixers' targeted free-agent acquisition to pair alongside All-Stars Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nIf he comes to Philly, sources believe George will help recruit solid role players for the Sixers' pursuit of an NBA championship-caliber roster.\n\nAs a result, Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey could be in line to carry out the major splash he had planned in free agency. Since last summer, the plan was to clear up enough cap space and acquire draft picks needed to lure an A-list addition.\n\nBut if George lands in Orlando or elsewhere, the Sixers would have to gamble on their at least fifth, sixth, and seventh options.\n\nWould they think about trying to trade for New Orleans forward Brandon Ingram, who may not be the perfect fit?\n\nHow about making a play for Golden State free agent shooting guard Klay Thompson, who's struggling to regain his All-Star form?\n\nWhat about Chicago Bulls free agent forward DeMar DeRozan, who relies heavily on his mid-range game? Or will they change their minds about not seeking a trade for Bulls guard Zach LaVine, a less-than-ideal fit?\n\n\" READ MORE: Sixers rookie Jared McCain isn't bothered by critics, and won't change a thing: 'I'm always going to be myself'\n\nNone of the four will help the Sixers challenge the Boston Celtics for NBA supremacy.\n\nAt best, they'll battle the Indiana Pacers and Milwaukee Bucks for the right to be the Eastern Conference's third-best team.\n\nThe Celtics would be in a class of their own, heading into free agency. The addition of Mikal Bridges also makes the New York Knicks the East's second-best squad heading into next season.\n\nThe Sixers have had their eyes on other lucrative-salary impact players in case they don't get George.\n\nBut the second-, third- and fourth-best options are all off the board.\n\nLeBron James will agree to a free-agent deal for hometown discount to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers after they drafted his son, Bronny James, on Thursday. Jimmy Butler intends to remain with the Miami Heat instead of seeking a trade. And OG Anunoby has agreed to a five-year, $212.5 million deal to remain with the Knicks.\n\nThe Sixers may have a shot at Ingram, who is expected to become available via a trade.\n\nThe 6-8, 190-pounder wants to remain in New Orleans. He's seeking a long-term deal, and if he and the Pelicans fail to agree on one before next season, he could be traded for the final year of his current contract.\n\nIngram will make $36 million next season, but is eligible for a four-year extension worth up to $52 million per season this summer. But the Pelicans are \"unlikely\" to offer a maximum salary and will look to trade him if no deal is reached. However, their asking price has been steep.\n\nIngram has career averages of 19.4 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 4.3 assists. He was named an All-Star and the league's most improved player in 2020. But due to injuries, he's only played in more than 64 games a season once during eight NBA seasons.\n\nThompson is a five-time All-Star shooting guard, coming off a five-year, $189.9 million deal with the Warriors.\n\n\" READ MORE: The moves made over these next few weeks are critical, vital even, for the Sixers and Daryl Morey\n\nHe wants at least a three-year contract. That could be a tough sell for a 34-year-old, who lost his starting spot late in the season and is two years removed from knee and Achilles tendon injuries.\n\nMotivated to prove he's still impactful, the four-time NBA champion could be in line for a comeback season. His ability to hit shots makes him the type of player the Sixers could use for the right price.\n\nThe Bulls offered DeRozan a two-year contract up to $40 million per season. The 15-year veteran wants a longer-term deal. There's an increased likelihood that he leaves Chicago via a sign-and-trade or as an unrestricted free agent. The Sixers would probably have to give the 34-year-old at least a three-year deal.\n\nHowever, DeRozan is coming off a season where he averaged 24 points, 5.3 assists, and 1.1 steals. The six-time All-Star finished second in voting for the NBA's clutch player of the year.\n\nThe Bulls have wanted to move LaVine for a while. However, the Sixers haven't been interested. The two-time All-Star guard played in just 25 games last season because of a pair of injuries in his right foot. He's a ball-dominant player with three seasons left on a five-year, $215.1 million deal he signed on July 7, 2022.\n\nThe optimism surrounding the Sixers' free agency vanished when it seemed like they were out on George sweepstakes. Some folks were having reservations about Morey's ability to lure top-notch free agents.\n\nFans became upset with the Sixers' inability to make blockbuster moves for A-list players before February's trade deadline like the Knicks and Indiana Pacers did. The Knicks acquired Anunoby on Dec. 30, while the Pacers acquired Pascal Siakam on Jan. 17.\n\nLike Anunoby, Siakam has since agreed to a maximum-salary contract to remain with his new team.\n\nThe Sixers did get valuable assets in return for shipping James Harden to the Clippers on Nov. 1. They received expiring contracts and draft capital to help with trades and to keep their cap space intact this summer.\n\nTo lesser extent, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is a role-playing free-agent candidate who could help the Sixers. However, the Magic, Bulls and Dallas Mavericks will also go after the two-time NBA champion. The Nuggets reportedly declined to do a sign-and-trade with the Mavs for the shooting guard.\n\nBulls center and former Sixer Andre Drummond could be a free-agent target for Philly. The Sixers would also like to re-sign Nico Batum, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Kyle Lowry in free agency.\n\n\" READ MORE: Sixers go all in on bigs in NBA draft's second day, drafting Adem Bona and adding Justin Edwards\n\nThey're also expected to re-sign Maxey, a restricted free agent, with a maximum salary up to five years, $204.5 million.\n\nBut the Sixers now have a great shot to put their cap space to perfect use.\n\nThe Sixers would have an All-Star guard in Maxey, an All-Star wing in George, and an All-Star center in Embiid. Their chances of closing the gap on the Celtics would overwhelmingly improve.\n\nGeorge, 34, is coming off his 14th season. In addition to being a nine-time All-Star, he is a six-time All-NBA selection and a four-time All-Defensive pick.\n\nHe averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.5 steals this season. He shot a career-best 41.3% on three-pointers.\n\nWe'll see what George decides, perhaps as early as Sunday evening.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia

ESPN's Bobby Marks said the Sixers could sign George to a four-year, $212-million max deal without making a trade.\n\nBy signing George at $49.5 million for next season, the Sixers would still have $14.2 million in projected cap room.\n\n\"Philadelphia, that's the team to keep an eye on,\" Marks said Sunday.\n\nEmbiid is on record encouraging President Daryl Morey to add a piece or pieces to bolster the Sixers so they can challenge the NBA champion Boston Celtics.\n\n\"I can't stand them,\" he said on ABC during the NBA Finals. \"I can't stand them.

George, a native of Palmdale, California, declined his 2024-25 player option (worth nearly $49 million) shortly before the 5 p.m. ET deadline on Saturday, and, minutes later, Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes reported that the Sixers are a \"legitimate threat\" to sign him.\n\nThe nine-time All-Star is eligible to sign a four-year deal worth up to $221 million with the Clippers, but they have reportedly been unwilling to offer him more than three years of guaranteed salary. Other teams with the requisite cap space (i.e. ones that can accommodate a starting salary of $49 million), including Philadelphia, can offer him up to $212 million over four years.\n\nThe Sixers have long been a rumored eventual destination (albeit one whose interest in signing him reportedly waned earlier this month) for the 34-year-old forward because they are in an unusual position: Even though they have 2023 Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid signed to a maximum contract and are positioned to re-sign All-Star Tyrese Maxey to a (smaller) maximum contract this offseason, they can sign another star to a full max deal. (This is because, until Maxey, the No. 21 pick in the 2020 draft, actually signs his new deal, he will only account for $13 million -- his \"cap hold\" -- on their cap sheet.)\n\nPhiladelphia hasn't had a wing like George since Jimmy Butler left town five years ago, and George may be a better fit because of his shooting. If it is going to assemble a \"Big 3,\" though, it will have to renounce a bunch of free agents and its front office will have to get creative with what little financial flexibility remains. To maintain some semblance of depth, team president Daryl Morey will need to use the $8 million room exception and minimum contracts wisely.\n\nIt remains unclear how serious George is about potentially leaving Los Angeles for the East Coast. If he were willing to accept Los Angeles' terms, though, he would have signed an extension months ago, like Kawhi Leonard, his co-star for the last five seasons, did in January. At the time, Leonard said that he expected George -- and James Harden, who is also about to hit free agency -- to stay with the Clippers, too. Now, with George set to take meetings with multiple teams starting Sunday night, per ESPN, here's the big question: Does George really see himself as the Sixers' missing piece, or is he using them as leverage?", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmdale,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palmdale, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palmdale, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/29/2d8aedc1-b834-476d-9efb-13ebf2301850/thumbnail/1200x675/b66e14d553d1e3bec2d3f5c5ce382af7/untitled-design.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693790", "eventUri": "eng-9693790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The New York Knicks were also viewed as a potential trade option until they acquired two-way wing Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets earlier this week.\n\nInstead, George hits the open market.\n\nThis could be a leverage ploy to try to force George's hometown Clippers into offering a full max deal, which they have been unwilling to do up until this point. But Yahoo! Sports' Chris Haynes reported shortly after George's opt-out that the Sixers are expected to \"aggressively pursue\" him to pair with 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid and All-Star Tyrese Maxey in an effort to challenge the championship-winning Boston Celtics. The Sixers and upstart Orlando Magic are the only playoff-caliber teams with realistic capability to sign George into their available cap space this summer.\n\nAnd Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey has been clear since his end-of-season news conference in early May that he still believes in collecting star talent. George has long boasted the frame and skill to be a standout on both ends of the floor, averaging 22.6 points on 47.1% shooting, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.5 steals last season. But his age (he turned 34 in May) and injury history have drawn questions from outsiders about signing George to a lengthy, lucrative max contract.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Sixers are going free-agent shopping. They've previously hit the market with mixed results.\n\n\"The reality is you need very good players,\" Morey said in May. \"You need better players than your opponents, and there isn't really a formula. As long as the players are playing at a high level, we're focused on Joel and Tyrese -- and we're focused on now.\"\n\nGeorge will reportedly begin meeting with teams, including the Clippers, on Sunday night. He could make a swift choice, as many players do once the free-agency flurry officially begins. Or, he could put the Sixers' crucial summer in a holding pattern, where each day that passes feels excruciatingly long.\n\nGeorge's decision-making, after all, is tough to predict. He shocked the NBA landscape in 2019, when he forced a trade out of the Oklahoma City Thunder to join superstar Kawhi Leonard in Los Angeles. And when George chose to re-sign with the Thunder the summer prior, he did so at a late-night party with then-teammate Russell Westbrook.\n\nIf George returns to the Clippers, the remaining options for the Sixers have dwindled in recent days.\n\nBrandon Ingram is still a star-level trade possibility, especially after the New Orleans Pelicans did not include him in their deal to acquire Atlanta Hawks guard Dejounte Murray Friday night. Versatile wing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has declined his player option with the Denver Nuggets, putting him on the open market. Longtime-yet-aging All-Stars Klay Thompson and DeMar DeRozan are still free-agents-to-be, with a report from The Athletic's Anthony Slater surfacing Saturday evening that the Warriors are \"preparing\" to lose Thompson. Bruce Brown, who had his option picked up by the Toronto Raptors to make him a trade chip, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who is on a Minnesota Timberwolves roster that is about to become expensive, could also be attractive.\n\nBut that list is already significantly shorter than it was less than two weeks ago.\n\n\" READ MORE: Sixers rookie Jared McCain isn't bothered by critics, and won't change a thing: 'I'm always going to be myself'\n\nAfter the Knicks traded for Bridges, they quickly agreed to a new contract with standout wing OG Anunoby. Defensive guard Alex Caruso, a long-coveted trade target across the league, was acquired by the Thunder before the draft. Pascal Siakam and Malik Monk agreed to return to the Indiana Pacers and Sacramento Kings, respectively. Per ESPN, former Sixer Jimmy Butler is not expected to ask for a trade from the Miami Heat, even if they do not come to terms on an extension.\n\nAnd from the pie-in-the-sky category, LeBron James is expected to return to the Los Angeles Lakers after the team drafted his son, Bronny, and hired former podcasting partner JJ Redick to be the team's head coach. Kevin Durant, meanwhile, is not on the market, according to an emphatic post on X (formerly Twitter) by Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia.\n\nGeorge's choice -- and how long it takes -- could also impact how the Sixers proceed with their own free agents, whom they have been permitted to negotiate with since the NBA Finals ended on June 16. Of those 10 players, veteran forward Nico Batum, veteran guard Kyle Lowry, and athletic wing Kelly Oubre Jr. are expected to return, a source told The Inquirer.\n\nBut George remains the biggest domino still to fall.\n\nHis decision Saturday keeps the Sixers in the running.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gina_mizell@inquirer.com", "name": "Gina Mizell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikal_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikal Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

They created a lot of cap space for this very moment.\n\nIt became official on Saturday when Paul George officially opted out of his contract for the 2024-25 season which makes him a free agent. There will be plenty of teams with similar cap space to Philadelphia to make a run at George.\n\nFor good reason. George is one of the top players in the league-he averaged 22.6 points in the 2023-24 season-and is one of the more proven wing players in the league. If the Sixers were to add George to Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, then they would have to be considered one of the bigger challenges to the Boston Celtics in the East.\n\nWith that being said, who are the bigger challenges to the Sixers for George? Well, for one, the Orlando Magic have similar cap space to the Sixers and will be one of the teams George will meet with on Sunday evening when the free agency frenzy begins.\n\nThe Clippers will also have a meeting with PG-13 when the time comes.\n\nIt would be tough to see George going across the country at this stage of his career. However, if the Sixers could coax him to Philadelphia, it would be a huge upgrade to the roster and would boost their chances of contending in the East.

Could they both land with the Sixers?\n\nNews broke just over 24 hours before the start of NBA free agency on Sunday evening that Los Angeles Clippers star wing Paul George is opting out of his contract and entering free agency, with the Sixers looming as a \"legitimate threat\" to sign the nine-time All-Star.\n\nThe Sixers have been positioning themselves for this moment for the better part of a year as their quest for the ideal third star next to Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey continued.\n\nBut what if they found a fourth star, too?\n\nLauri Markkanen of the Utah Jazz has become one of the most dynamic offensive forwards in the entire NBA over the last two seasons, a genuine three-level scorer who can put the ball in the basket at the highest of levels. As he enters the final year of his current contract, reports have circulated that teams are monitoring whether or not Markkanen, who is only entering his age-27 season, could become available for trade in the near future.\n\nSixers free agency primer: Literally everything you need to know\n\nIt could take a massive amount of draft picks to woo the Jazz -- rightfully so given how good the Finnish seven-footer has become. But if it is possible, the Sixers are armed with a collection of future first-round selections to make a competitive offer.\n\nPulling off a trade for Markkanen after signing George to the maximum offer he is expected to command -- which is projected to be worth $49,350,000 in its first season -- would be extremely tricky.\n\nBut after a few hours of crunching numbers and asking various salary cap experts, it does seem that this path is feasible if things broke right: that is, the Sixers could theoretically put these four players together without violating any of the league's salary cap rules.\n\nBefore we get to all of the salary cap machinations, it is worth pointing out that there are some potential downsides to doing this: Markkanen is, of course, due for a new and hefty contract soon. The Sixers' financial flexibility after assembling this hypothetical four-star unit would be incredibly limited, resembling the hellish situation the Phoenix Suns are currently in. There is a real argument to be made that going down this road would be reckless, giving the Sixers a one- or two-year window at best and then putting them in an extremely precarious position.\n\nBut with the Boston Celtics looking like a juggernaut and teams like the New York Knicks pushing all of their chips in, it is not unreasonable to expect the Sixers to do the same -- and if there was ever a group of four players to do it for, it would be this one.\n\nSo, come on a journey with me as I outline the path to building a team featuring Embiid, Maxey, George and Markkanen:\n\nAccording to the projections of salary cap expert Yossi Gozlan on capsheets.com, if the Sixers renounce the rights to all of their free agents other than Maxey -- Tobias Harris, Buddy Hield, Nic Batum, Robert Covington, De'Anthony Melton, Kyle Lowry, Mo Bamba, Jeff Dowtin Jr., KJ Martin, Kelly Oubre Jr., Cam Payne and Terquavion Smith -- they would have $54,781,404 in cap space. That is our starting point in this exercise.\n\nThe first year of George's max contract is projected to be worth $49,350,000. His deal eating up that chunk of salary cap space trims their cap room to $5,431,404. But, the NBA salary cap has something called incomplete roster charges: when a team does not have at least 13 players who they either have under contract or own the Bird rights of, the team is charged one rookie minimum salary against their cap space for each number below 13 that they are at.\n\nSo, signing George would remove one incomplete roster charge, which is projected to be valued at $1,160,564. So, that gives the Sixers $6,591,948 in cap space.\n\nWhen a team makes a normal in-season trade, any player they trade for cannot be traded along with other players for a certain period of time. Free agent signings are not allowed to be traded at all until Dec. 15. But if a team absorbs a player into their cap space via trade, that player can be rerouted at any time, and they are allowed to be aggregated with other salaries.\n\nSo, the idea here is that the Sixers would use this $6.5 million or so of cap space to absorb salary via trade so that they can eventually be sent to Utah in a Markkanen deal.\n\nThere are a few players on expiring contracts who they could likely acquire from teams for little to no cost. Reggie Jackson of the Charlotte Hornets, for example, will make $5,250,000 next season and has no place with his new team in the short- or long-term.\n\nOf course, the Sixers would only perform Step No. 3 if they knew Step No. 4 was going to immediately follow:\n\nThis is, of course, the hardest part -- and the component of this plan that makes it the hardest to see actually coming to fruition. First, the Jazz have to decide that they are ready to move Markkanen. Then, the Sixers have to hope that no other team makes a stronger offer than what they are capable of. Unfortunately for the Sixers, there are teams out there with stronger collections of future first-round picks, so even if the Jazz did decide it was time to trade their best player, it is not exactly a lock that the Sixers could get him if they want to do so.\n\nSo, the structure of the trade would be Markkanen going to the Sixers in exchange for Paul Reed, Ricky Council IV, whichever player(s) they acquire to satisfy Step No. 3 and a collection of future draft picks.\n\nA quick note: the Jazz are the team that signed Reed to his unusual three-year deal last summer, before the Sixers matched the offer sheet and ensured he would return to Philadelphia, so it is entirely plausible that Utah would value him to some extent beyond just being salary filler.\n\nAgain, though, things would need to break right for the Sixers to make this offer appealing to Utah beyond its simple legality.\n\nWith George and Markkanen secured in this hypothetical world, the Sixers would have the room mid-level exception -- worth a hair over $8 million -- and veteran's minimum contracts to fill out the remainder of their roster. They could choose to offer the entirety of that MLE to one player in hopes of finding a strong fifth starter, or they could split it up among two viable rotation contributors.\n\nThis will be the Sixers' final piece of business officially, but it will be their easiest: Maxey will agree with the team on a five-year contract worth just below $205 million.\n\nAnd just like that, Embiid, Maxey, George and Markkanen would all be on the same roster. Take a deep breath.\n\nPutting these four incredible talents on the same team in today's NBA would be a remarkable feat in itself, even just on the level of displaying tremendous creativity. But beyond the 2024-25 season, the team would be in an unspeakably disadvantageous situation from a financial standpoint moving forward if they were to re-sign Markkanen.\n\nOne final disclaimer: none of this is to say the Sixers are going pull all of this off, or that it is a remotely realistic outcome, or even that they should attempt to do it if it was possible. It is merely an attempt to outline the procedural path to assembling a roster featuring these four-star players.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Markkanen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lauri Markkanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dowtin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Dowtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Bamba", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mo Bamba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Anthony_Melton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De'Anthony Melton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Covington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Covington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Batum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Batum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_21752323.a6960120.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693790", "eventUri": "eng-9693790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-15", "textStart": 4073, "textEnd": 4080}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

They have a lot riding on this summer -- nothing short of their ability to be title contenders for the rest of Joel Embiid's prime -- but they have the resources to make some noise.\n\nOn top of signing Tyrese Maxey to an extension, the 76ers have to fill out their roster. They can open up $53 million in cap space if they renounce all of their cap holds besides Maxey's (which they can't do), giving them enough space to add a player on a max contract. Daryl Morey has hoped for a star to come along ever since he traded James Harden but he could sign some inflated deals this offseason if he can't land the right one. Whatever happens in Philly, it's bound to be interesting.\n\nHere are three predictions for what the 76ers will do in 2024 free agency.\n\n76ers win the Paul George sweepstakes\n\nGeorge declined his player option and will reportedly take meetings with three teams: The Los Angeles Clippers, Orlando Magic, and the 76ers. Unless leaving the West Coast is truly not something George wants any part of at this point in his career, Philly seems most likely to land the player who will likely be the biggest name to change teams this summer,\n\nGeorge and the Clippers have been on the outs for a while now. Talks of a contract negotiation stalled as LA refused to offer a fourth year, mirroring their offer with the one that Kawhi Leonard previously agreed to. With other good teams seemingly ready to offer him more, PG-13 isn't any closer to blinking in negotiations and accepting that offer now. Leaving his hometown and the team he spent the past five seasons with would be a major change but it seems like that's what he will have to do in order to make the most of his final big payday.\n\nThe Orlando Magic are also an intriguing option but they don't give George the most immediate upside to compete for a championship. While Orlando's youthful roster gives the team a potentially longer window of being competitive as well as the ammo in future trades to upgrade further, no one on that team is as good as Embiid or Maxey. Building strength in numbers is tougher when another team has two legitimate All-NBA talents to flaunt. The immediate upside of playing with an arguably-best-active-player level of superstar in Embiid should supersede the Magic's future upside for a 34-year-old like George.\n\nGeorge isn't the stellar defender he once was, has a worrisome injury history and is going to sign a gargantuan contract that will almost certainly become a negative asset in its final seasons. But of all the available options left, George is the one who can make the biggest impact on the 76ers with his fantastic three-point shooting, on-ball scoring and his ability to leverage both strengths to set up teammates for scoring opportunities.\n\nThe Sixers are running out of high-level players that they could acquire this offseason. Several have either been traded (Mikal Bridges, Dejounte Murray, and Alex Caruso) or tentatively agreed to re-sign with their current teams (LeBron James, OG Anunoby). Trade candidates like Jimmy Butler and Lauri Markkanen are not going to be relinquished easily and Philly could easily get outbid by other teams.\n\nGeorge is far from the perfect addition but with the remaining feasible options being free agents DeMar DeRozan or Klay Thompson or trade possibility Brandon Ingram, he's the best the Sixers can do right now. Can they stomach another season where they put another temporary roster around Embiid in the hopes of the perfect star becoming available, even if that roster has better role players like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope? And if one does become available, do they even have the assets to compete in trades with other teams? George's fit with Embiid and Maxey is really good and he should at least still be a star-level contributor for a few more seasons.\n\nKyle Lowry and Kelly Oubre Jr. re-sign in Philly\n\nThe 76ers may be losing most of its roster to unrestricted free agency but that doesn't mean they won't keep at least a few players. Lowry and Oubre represent two of the most likely players to want to stay and who could sign contracts that still allow Philly to keep its cap space.\n\nMinimum contracts not counting toward a team's cap makes them a lot more valuable under the new CBA. Lowry seems likely to sign one if he's back with the 76ers, which is almost surely his preferred destination. Whatever the former All-Star has left in the tank in his age-38 season will be helpful for Philly, though the team can't depend on him as heavily as it did last season.\n\nOubre, meanwhile, could sign a contract that comes from the 76ers' mid-level exception worth just over $8 million. He may command more than that from another team but he greatly enjoyed being a Sixer and may not have a better shot at playing real minutes on other teams at Philly's level. His improving defense, athleticism and scoring confidence are quite helpful though, just like with Lowry, the Sixers should try to find more dependable players for their starting lineup and bring Oubre off the bench.\n\nNico Batum is someone the Sixers should have an interest in bringing back, though given his potential decision to retire, it's harder to read into whether he'll be back. Lowry and Oubre seem like the safest bets to return to Philadelphia.\n\n76ers trade Paul Reed, sign backup center on cheap contract\n\nWith the selection of Adem Bona in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft, the 76ers may feel more inclined to trade Reed. He makes $7.7 million this upcoming season, which is reasonable for his age and talent, but they might value the additional cap space and draft pick(s) they could get in a trade more. The Daryl Morey regime may have drafted Reed but they did not agree to this contact with him. He signed it as an offer sheet that was later matched.\n\nWith Bona in the fold, the 76ers have another young, athletic, high-motor center to utilize off the bench. They could decide to sign the rookie to a two-way, keeping a roster spot open for a player more likely to be a contributor this season while Bona develops in the G League. But if Reed can be flipped for a draft pick or two to use in other trades (or be flipped for a player with a more premium skill set), Philly seems likely to make that move and then sign someone to hold down the fort until Bona is ready.\n\nAndre Drummond, a former Sixer who has said a lot of good things about the team since being traded, remains a likely option. Philly tried to trade for him at the deadline and can now sign him to be Embiid's backup again. Jonas Valanciunas could also be an option for Philly. He's a lumbering, uber-strong center with more of a back-to-the-basket, muscle-his-way-into-offensive-boards type of game, similar to Drummond.\n\nOf all the potential backup center options that might not cost much, Goga Bitadze and Jalen Smith may not only be among the best but the ones with the most upside. Both are just 24 years old and very productive rebounders on both ends of the floor, particularly on the offensive end, which would offset the loss of Reed's knack for fighting for extra possessions. Bitadze has a great feel for playmaking and blocking shots while Smith is a very solid three-point shooter.\n\nReed struggled as a starter last season but still made strides in his game and remains the most dependable backup Embiid has ever had. Continuity is something Philly has lacked and losing Reed, even though he has only played very sparingly with Embiid, cuts further into that. But the Sixers only have so much wiggle room, making Bball Paul a trade candidate.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

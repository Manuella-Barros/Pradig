Jean Carroll civil case, can move forward.\n\nIn May, lawyers for ABC and Stephanopoulos asked Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga to throw out lawsuit \"with prejudice,\" defending Stephanopoulos' statements as \"substantially true,\" asserting they were protected by Florida's fair report privilege, and arguing that Trump's claims were collaterally estopped.\n\n\"In this case, former President Trump seeks to re-litigate a meritless theory of defamation that he has already lost twice in New York. Mr. Trump is collaterally estopped from doing so here,\" ABC argued earlier. \"And if this Court were to reach the merits, at bottom, this case asserts that even after a jury has found that a person committed a violent sexual assault, it is defamatory to say that the person committed a 'rape.' That is not a proposition Florida law recognizes.\"\n\nFor Altonaga, however, she agrees with Trump's \"position on each\" at this point of the litigation.\n\n\"To be clear, the Court is not reaching the merits of Plaintiff's claims. Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan's reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos's statements were not defamatory. That is not the issue before the Court now,\" the judge wrote first of the collateral estoppel argument. \"At this stage, the Court only decides that Defendants have not satisfied their burden to show collateral estoppel should apply, and that collateral estoppel would not be fairly applied in these circumstances.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys have argued that the court need not look much further than the jury verdict sheet in the Carroll case, which checked off \"no\" as to a rape liability finding.\n\nWhat the Trump lawsuit did not immediately grapple with, as Law&Crime reported, was what Senior U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said after the verdict in his rulings, particularly that forcible digital penetration is widely understood to be \"rape.\"\n\n\"The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was 'raped' within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape,'\" Kaplan wrote. \"Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\"\n\nFrom there, Kaplan said the \"jury implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll.\"\n\nDuring the ABC segment Trump is suing over, Stephanopoulos questioned Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, on how she, as a rape survivor, could still support Trump.\n\nWhen the clash got heated, Stephanopoulos pointed to a Washington Post article on Kaplan's ruling, headlined \"Judge clarifies: Yes, Trump was found to have raped E. Jean Carroll.\"\n\n\"The judge affirmed there was, in fact, rape. Donald Trump was found to have committed rape,\" Stephanopoulos said, as the graphic aired. \"That's just a fact.\"\n\nWhen Mace responded \"that is a civil judgment, not a criminal court. They are two different things, and you know better,\" Stephanopoulos answered: \"I just showed you the facts.\"\n\nAs a result, the ABC motion to dismiss argued that Stephanopoulos' citation of the Washington Post article in real-time showed his statements were \"substantially true\" and were protected by the fair report privilege.\n\nFor Altonaga, even if the cases cited by ABC were \"compelling,\" when viewing the segment \"in its entirety and in context, from the perspective of a reasonable viewer,\" it's not so simple, as the fact remains the jury verdict itself said \"no\" as to a rape liability finding and it wasn't \"clear from the broadcast itself that Stephanopoulos was, in fact, reporting on Judge Kaplan's findings, rather than the jury's (or juries') verdict(s)'\":\n\nHere, of course, New York has opted to separate out a crime of rape; and Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term, but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding. Thus, while Defendants' cited cases are compelling, they are not directly responsive to the issue of whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found Plaintiff liable for rape by a jury despite the jury's verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape under New York Penal Law.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Court thus cannot definitively say it was substantially true to report on the (single) jury's verdict in Carroll II -- which did not find Plaintiff liable for rape as that term is defined under New York law -- as finding Plaintiff liable for rape.\n\nWhile again not opining on the merits of Trump's claims, Altonaga said the case should not be dismissed because \"a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed[.]\"\n\n\"[A] reasonable jury could interpret Stephanopoulos's statements as defamatory. Stephanopoulos's exchange with Mace lasted about ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury -- or juries -- had found Plaintiff liable for rape,\" the judge wrote. \"In fact, of course, the Carroll II jury did not find Plaintiff liable for rape under New York Penal Law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape. Yet, none of these particularities make it into the segment such that a reasonable viewer would have indisputably understood what Defendants now brief in detail.\"\n\nABC's assertion that it was shielded by the fair report privilege didn't pass muster either, as the judge found the defendants \"have not met their burden of proving\" it \"applies.\"\n\nAltonaga, citing to Alan Dershowitz's lawsuit against CNN, which is on appeal in the 11th Circuit, noted that the fair report privilege \"does not protect media where the omission of important context renders a report misleading.\"\n\n\"Here, a reasonable viewer -- especially one who was aware that Plaintiff had been charged with rape under New York Penal Law -- could have been misled by Stephanopoulos's statements, which did not include the jury's original findings and only fleetingly referenced the interpretation Judge Kaplan later offered,\" the judge wrote.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief judge (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_estoppel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Collateral estoppel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Altonaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cecilia Altonaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "E.

Jean Carroll may not have been \"substantially true.\" She noted that the anchor appeared to misconstrue the common understanding of rape with how it's defined under New York Penal Law, which indicates that rape must involve penile penetration.\n\n\"Here, of course, New York has opted to separate out a crime of rape; and Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term, but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding,\" Altonaga wrote.\n\nABC News had no comment about the decision.\n\nTrump lauded the decision on Truth Social, writing: \"A BIG WIN TODAY IN HIGH FLORIDA COURT AGAINST ABC FAKE NEWS, AND LIDDLE' GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS. A POWERFUL CASE! BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL BE FORCED BY THE COURTS TO START TELLING THE TRUTH.\"\n\nThe ruling allows the case to move forward to discovery.\n\nAltonaga cited multiple examples where Stephanopoulos continued to refer to a jury's decision on the case, even though it was Judge Lewis Kaplan who made the distinction between the legal and common understandings of rape in a clarifying motion.\n\n\"A jury may, upon viewing the segment, find there was sufficient context,\" Altonaga wrote. \"A jury may also conclude Plaintiff fails to establish other elements of his claim ... But a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate.\"\n\nTrump sued the network and Stephanopoulos in March after the anchor pressed Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) about the New York civil verdict, asking how she squared her endorsement of Trump with the jury's findings on sexual abuse.\n\nA Manhattan jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse last year and awarded Carroll a $5 million verdict as a result. When asked if they believed Trump raped Carroll, the jury checked a \"no\" box on a verdict sheet -- solely due to the definition of rape in New York state law being nonconsensual penile penetration. The jury could not consider Carroll's allegations rape.

Jean Carroll. Trump contended that he was defamed as Stephanopoulos did not make the distinction.\n\nU.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga wrote that she \"does not find that a reasonable jury must -- or even is likely to -- conclude Stephanopoulos's statements were defamatory. A jury may, upon viewing the segment, find there was sufficient context. A jury may also conclude Plaintiff fails to establish other elements of his claim. But a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate.\"\n\nRead the Trump-ABC ruling.\n\nIn their motion to dismiss, ABC's attorneys pointed to what the judge in the E. Jean Carroll case, Lewis Kaplan, wrote in a later ruling. \"The finding that Ms.Carroll failed to prove that she was 'raped' within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape.' Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that,\" Kaplan wrote.\n\nIn a separate phase of the Carroll case this year, a jury awarded her an additional $83.3 million in damages. That followed another jury's award of $5 million in damages to her in the initial phase of the case. Trump has denied Carroll's claims and is appealing the verdicts.\n\nDuring the interview, Stephanopoulos played a video in which Mace said that she was a victim of rape. Stephanopoulos first asked Mace, \"You endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape. How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony that we just saw?\"\n\nMace said to Stephanopoulos, \"I've lived for 30 years with an incredible amount of shame over being raped. I didn't come forward because of that judgment and shame that I felt. And it is a shame that you will never feel, George. And I am not going to sit here on your show and be asked a question meant to shame me about another potential rape victim.\"\n\nStephanopoulos continued to question Mace on the point, while denying that he was attempting to shame her.\n\nMace said that Trump \"defended himself over that and denies that it ever happened, but he was not found guilty in a criminal court of law.\"\n\nAltonaga's ruling was not on the merits of the case, but that Trump's lawsuit had met the threshold to move forward.\n\nIn her ruling, Altonaga wrote that \"Stephanopoulos's exchange with Mace lasted about ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury -- or juries -- had found Plaintiff liable for rape.\" The judge wrote that the \"jury did not find [Trump] liable for rape under New York Penal Law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape. Yet, none of these particularities make it into the segment such that a reasonable viewer would have indisputably understood what [ABC News] now brief in detail.\"\n\nThe judge also rejected the network's defense that it was protected under Florida's fair reporting privilege, writing that it does \"not protect media where the omission of important context renders a report misleading.\"\n\nABC had no immediate comment.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump called the ruling a \"big win\" and a \"great day for our country.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ted_johnson@deadline.com", "name": "Ted Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(spray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mace (spray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "E.

Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and the network defamed him when Stephanopoulos said during a contentious on-air interview with Rep. Nancy Mace that a jury found Trump had \"raped\" Carroll, a writer whose own cases against Trump led to him being found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nThe ruling Wednesday amounted to a victory for Trump, who can now move forward with the case as he dives into the 2024 presidential campaign, where he routinely bashes the press for what he believes is unfair coverage.\n\nABC News did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nWhile a Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, and held him liable for battery, the jury did not find that she proved her claim that he raped her. However, months later, while dismissing Trump's countersuit against Carroll, US Judge Lewis Kaplan concluded that the claim Trump raped Carroll was \"substantially true,\" writing that \"he 'raped' her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.\n\nIn the Trump-ABC lawsuit, US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote Wednesday that these definitions were different enough to let the case move forced.\n\n\"New York has opted to separate out a crime of rape. Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term, but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding,\" Altonaga wrote, adding that this case would turn on \"whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury's verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.\"\n\nAltonaga went on to say, \"Judge Kaplan was reviewing a jury's damages award. His analysis necessarily focused on what Carroll had and had not proved at trial, as well as the harm Carroll experienced from (Trump's) abuse. There was no discussion of how to accurately report on the jury's findings.\"\n\nThe judge made clear in her 21-page ruling that she wasn't weighing in - one way or the other - on the merits of Trump's claim that he was defamed by ABC News, and wasn't trying to suggest that he'll win the case.\n\nIn a heated interview on \"This Week\" in March, Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Mace, a rape survivor, over her continued support for Trump, in the wake of the legal cases that awarded $88 million to Carroll for Trump's battery and defamation against her.\n\n\"Stephanopoulos's exchange with Mace lasted about ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury -- or juries -- had found Plaintiff liable for rape,\" Altonaga 'wrote in her ruling Wednesday. \"In fact, of course, the Carroll II jury did not find (Trump) liable for rape under New York Penal Law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape.\"\n\nTrump, who regularly demonizes the press and has filed numerous unsuccessful lawsuits against news outlets, hailed Altonaga's ruling as a \"BIG WIN\" against \"ABC FAKE NEWS\" in a post on his Truth Social platform.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Altonaga denied the motion to dismiss Trump's defamation lawsuit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who was accused of mischaracterizing a jury's finding that a Manhattan jury found Trump liable for sexual assault in the separate defamation case brought by former columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\n\"Defendants have not met their burden of proving the fair report privilege applies,\" Altonaga, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote in a 21-page order. \"Any remaining questions as to the reasonableness of Stephanopoulos's statements are not for resolution on a motion to dismiss.\"\n\nTrump's defamation suit stems from statements made by Stephanopoulos during a March 10, 2024, interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). During the broadcast on This Week hosted by Stephanopoulos, he repeatedly stated Trump had been \"found liable for rape\" in connection with the Carroll case. This assertion, Trump claimed, was defamatory, because the jury did not come to that specific conclusion.\n\nThe background of the litigation involves two related cases, known as Carroll I and Carroll II, presided over by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in the Southern District of New York. In Carroll II, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll but did not find him liable for rape under New York Penal Law. Despite this, Kaplan characterized the jury's finding as equivalent to rape in common parlance, leading to some confusion and ambiguity in public interpretations of the verdict.\n\nTrump commended the decision in a statement to Truth Social on Wednesday, calling it a \"A BIG WIN TODAY IN HIGH FLORIDA COURT AGAINST ABC FAKE NEWS, AND LIDDLE' GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS.\"\n\n\"A POWERFUL CASE! BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL BE FORCED BY THE COURTS TO START TELLING THE TRUTH. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. MAGA2024,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn response to the allegations of defamation, ABC News and Stephanopoulos argued that the statements made during the interview were substantially true and protected by the fair report privilege, which shields journalists from some legal liability for their accurate coverage of official proceedings or documents. They contended that Kaplan's interpretation justified their characterization of the jury's findings.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHowever, Altonaga found that these arguments could not be conclusively resolved at this stage of the lawsuit. She noted that while Kaplan had indeed offered an interpretation aligning the jury's findings with a common understanding of rape, the jury's explicit verdict did not support the specific language used by Stephanopoulos. This distinction, she ruled, created enough ambiguity to warrant further examination by a jury.\n\nIn the motion to dismiss the case, the defendants argued that Kaplan's rulings in Carroll I and II should preclude Trump's current defamation claims. Altonaga disagreed, stating that the context and specific statements in the present case were sufficiently distinct from those in the Carroll cases to allow Trump's lawsuit to proceed.\n\nThe fair report privilege, which protects journalists when reporting on official proceedings, was also cited by the defense. Altonaga acknowledged that while this privilege offers broad protections, it does not apply when the reporting is misleading or lacks crucial context.\n\nGiven the possibility for Stephanopoulos's statements to mislead viewers about the jury's actual findings, she determined that this defense could not be decided at this stage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe case will now proceed to further litigation, where both parties will have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments in detail.\n\nThe Washington Examiner contacted ABC News for a statement.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "washington_examiner@gazette.com", "name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kaelan_deese@gazette.com", "name": "Kaelan Deese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_A._Kaplan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis A.

Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump filed the lawsuit in Florida federal court earlier this year, arguing that Stephanopoulos and the network defamed him when Stephanopoulos said during a contentious on-air interview with Rep. Nancy Mace that a jury found Trump had \"raped\" Carroll, a writer whose own cases against Trump led to him being found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nThe ruling Wednesday amounted to a victory for Trump, who can now move forward with the case as he dives into the 2024 presidential campaign, where he routinely bashes the press for what he believes is unfair coverage.\n\nABC News did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nWhile a Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, and held him liable for battery, the jury did not find that she proved her claim that he raped her. However, months later, while dismissing Trump's countersuit against Carroll, US Judge Lewis Kaplan concluded that the claim Trump raped Carroll was \"substantially true,\" writing that \"he 'raped' her in the broader sense of that word, as people generally understand it, though not as it is narrowly defined by New York state law.\n\nIn the Trump-ABC lawsuit, US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote Wednesday that these definitions were different enough to let the case move forced.\n\n\"New York has opted to separate out a crime of rape. Stephanopoulos's statements dealt not with the public's usage of that term, but the jury's consideration of it during a formal legal proceeding,\" Altonaga wrote, adding that this case would turn on \"whether it is substantially true to say a jury (or juries) found (Trump) liable for rape by a jury despite the jury's verdict expressly finding he was not liable for rape.\"\n\nAltonaga went on to say, \"Judge Kaplan was reviewing a jury's damages award. His analysis necessarily focused on what Carroll had and had not proved at trial, as well as the harm Carroll experienced from (Trump's) abuse. There was no discussion of how to accurately report on the jury's findings.\"\n\nThe judge made clear in her 21-page ruling that she wasn't weighing in - one way or the other - on the merits of Trump's claim that he was defamed by ABC News, and wasn't trying to suggest that he'll win the case.\n\nIn a heated interview on \"This Week\" in March, Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Mace, a rape survivor, over her continued support for Trump, in the wake of the legal cases that awarded $88 million to Carroll for Trump's battery and defamation against her.\n\n\"Stephanopoulos's exchange with Mace lasted about ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury -- or juries -- had found Plaintiff liable for rape,\" Altonaga 'wrote in her ruling Wednesday. \"In fact, of course, the Carroll II jury did not find (Trump) liable for rape under New York Penal Law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape.\"\n\nTrump, who regularly demonizes the press and has filed numerous unsuccessful lawsuits against news outlets, hailed Altonaga's ruling as a \"BIG WIN\" against \"ABC FAKE NEWS\" in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nCNN's Oliver Darcy contributed reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Altonaga denied the motion to dismiss Trump's defamation lawsuit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who was accused of mischaracterizing a jury's finding that a Manhattan jury found Trump liable for sexual assault in the separate defamation case brought by former columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\n\"Defendants have not met their burden of proving the fair report privilege applies,\" Altonaga, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote in a 21-page order. \"Any remaining questions as to the reasonableness of Stephanopoulos's statements are not for resolution on a motion to dismiss.\"\n\nTrump's defamation suit stems from statements made by Stephanopoulos during a March 10, 2024, interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). During the broadcast on This Week hosted by Stephanopoulos, he repeatedly stated Trump had been \"found liable for rape\" in connection with the Carroll case. This assertion, Trump claimed, was defamatory, because the jury did not come to that specific conclusion.\n\nThe background of the litigation involves two related cases, known as Carroll I and Carroll II, presided over by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in the Southern District of New York. In Carroll II, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll but did not find him liable for rape under New York Penal Law. Despite this, Kaplan characterized the jury's finding as equivalent to rape in common parlance, leading to some confusion and ambiguity in public interpretations of the verdict.\n\nTrump commended the decision in a statement to Truth Social on Wednesday, calling it a \"A BIG WIN TODAY IN HIGH FLORIDA COURT AGAINST ABC FAKE NEWS, AND LIDDLE' GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS.\"\n\n\"A POWERFUL CASE! BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL BE FORCED BY THE COURTS TO START TELLING THE TRUTH. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. MAGA2024,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn response to the allegations of defamation, ABC News and Stephanopoulos argued that the statements made during the interview were substantially true and protected by the fair report privilege, which shields journalists from some legal liability for their accurate coverage of official proceedings or documents. They contended that Kaplan's interpretation justified their characterization of the jury's findings.\n\nHowever, Altonaga found that these arguments could not be conclusively resolved at this stage of the lawsuit. She noted that while Kaplan had indeed offered an interpretation aligning the jury's findings with a common understanding of rape, the jury's explicit verdict did not support the specific language used by Stephanopoulos. This distinction, she ruled, created enough ambiguity to warrant further examination by a jury.\n\nIn the motion to dismiss the case, the defendants argued that Kaplan's rulings in Carroll I and II should preclude Trump's current defamation claims. Altonaga disagreed, stating that the context and specific statements in the present case were sufficiently distinct from those in the Carroll cases to allow Trump's lawsuit to proceed.\n\nThe fair report privilege, which protects journalists when reporting on official proceedings, was also cited by the defense. Altonaga acknowledged that while this privilege offers broad protections, it does not apply when the reporting is misleading or lacks crucial context.\n\nGiven the possibility for Stephanopoulos's statements to mislead viewers about the jury's actual findings, she determined that this defense could not be decided at this stage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe case will now proceed to further litigation, where both parties will have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments in detail.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaelan_deese@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Kaelan Deese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_A._Kaplan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis A.

She said that a \"reasonable jury\" could conclude that Trump had been defamed, and, as a result, \"dismissal is inappropriate\".\n\nThe decision allows the case to proceed to the discovery phase and possible trial.\n\nTrump heralded the ruling as a \"big win\". In a post on his Truth Social platform, he repeated his offensive moniker for the TV host as \"LIDDLE GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS\" and said the judgment would force the \"fake news media\" to tell the truth.\n\nThe anchor made his contested comment in an interview broadcast on ABC's Sunday news program, This Week With George Stephanopoulos, on 10 March this year. In it, he asked the Republican congresswoman from South Carolina, Nancy Mace, why she had endorsed Trump's presidential run even though he had been \"found liable for rape\".\n\nTrump lodged his defamation lawsuit nine days later.\n\nThe disputed remark concerned the civil cases that had been brought against Trump in New York by the writer and former Elle magazine advice columnist E Jean Carroll. In 2019 she accused Trump, who was then in the White House, of sexually assaulting and raping her in an encounter in the 1990s.\n\nTrump denied the allegations and made critical comments about Carroll, which she then challenged in a defamation lawsuit against him. She also issued a separate lawsuit seeking damages for sexual assault.\n\nIn the sexual assault case, a jury found in May last year in New York that Trump had \"sexually abused\" her but not that he had \"raped\" her. Under New York law, rape is defined as penile penetration whereas the jury found that he had digitally penetrated her.\n\nIn a later legal challenge, the federal judge presiding over the Carroll sexual assault case, Lewis Kaplan, concluded that the jury's finding that she had failed to prove Trump had raped her under New York's definition did not mean she failed to prove \"rape\" as many people understood it. He said the jury's verdict had established that Trump \"raped\" Carroll, \"albeit digitally rather than with his penis\".\n\nABC News and Stephanopoulos drew on Kaplan's comments to argue that Trump's claims in his defamation case against them had already been litigated, and that Stephanopoulos's comments were \"substantially true\". They also argued that they were protected from legal action for libel by Florida's fair reporting privilege, which gives news outlets qualified protection when they report accurately on information received from government officials. Trump changed his residency status to Florida after leaving office in 2021, living in his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.\n\nIn her ruling allowing the case to go forward, Altonaga stressed that she was not commenting either way on the merits of Trump's defamation case. But she rejected all three of the arguments pressed by the defendants.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_pilkington@theguardian.com", "name": "Ed Pilkington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discovery (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Altonaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cecilia Altonaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_A._Kaplan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis A.

Jean Carroll, the federal judge overseeing that New York case explained that the jury had essentially found that Trump had raped her, as that term is commonly understood. Nonetheless, a federal judge in Florida has allowed Trump's defamation claim against ABC and George Stephanopoulos to proceed, based on the anchor's use of the term \"rape\" to describe the jury's verdict.\n\nHere's why.\n\nAs a refresher, the Carroll jury found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her, but it didn't find that Trump had raped her. The New York federal judge who presided over that case, Lewis Kaplan, downplayed the distinction when he rejected Trump's challenge to the jury's multimillion dollar award as excessive, reasoning that just because the jury declined to find that Carroll had been raped under New York law, that didn't mean she failed to prove Trump raped her \"as many people commonly understand the word.\" Kaplan likewise rejected Trump's defamation claim against Carroll for her saying that he had raped her.\n\nThis new decision stems from Stephanopoulos' March interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in which he questioned her support for Trump despite him being \"found liable for rape.\" Stephanopoulos repeated that phrase several times during the interview. ABC and Stephanopoulos argued that the former president's defamation claim is foreclosed by the New York court's findings. But on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida rejected the defense motion to dismiss Trump's case. (If Altonaga's name sounds familiar, that may be because the George W. Bush appointee reportedly urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to step aside from Trump's classified documents case.)\n\nIn Trump's defamation suit, Altonaga distinguished Carroll's claim that Trump had raped her from Stephanopoulos' characterization of the jury verdict as having found that Trump had raped her. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could interpret the anchor's statements as defamatory.\n\nYet, she made clear that she wasn't necessarily agreeing that Trump had been defamed; rather, the judge's legal determination was that the defense didn't present a strong enough argument to dismiss Trump's case at this stage of litigation.\n\n\"Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan's reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos's statements were not defamatory,\" Altonaga wrote, adding that a jury that views the segment may find sufficient context to conclude Trump wasn't defamed.\n\nIn some respects, the ruling is like another recent Trump defamation win in Florida. In that state court case, he beat a motion to dismiss his claim against Pulitzer Prize Board members and staff, related to a statement about his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia. As with the Carroll-related claim, the rejection of that motion to dismiss doesn't mean that Trump will ultimately prevail -- only that his case can proceed.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_A._Kaplan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis A.

Jean Carroll. The former president's team wrote in their original suit that Stephanopoulos' statements were made \"with actual malice or with a reckless disregard for the truth.\"\n\nTrump praised Wednesday's decision, which was signed by Chief U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga for the Southern District of Florida, in a post to his Truth Social account Wednesday afternoon, describing it as a \"BIG WIN\" against \"ABC FAKE NEWS\" and \"LIDDLE' GEORGE SLOPADOPOLUS.\"\n\n\"A POWERFUL CASE!\" he added, writing in all caps. \"BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL BE FORCED BY THE COURTS TO START TELLING THE TRUTH. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. MAGA2024!\"\n\nTrump was found liable for the sexual assault and defamation of Carroll in May 2023. The former magazine columnist, who was awarded $5 million in damages, had claimed that Trump raped her in a New York City department store in the 1990s.\n\nThe jury on the case did not rule that Trump had raped Carroll. However, in August 2023, presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that Carroll's claims that Trump had raped her were \"substantially true,\" and that any legal distinction between rape and sexual assault were \"minimal.\" Carroll also won a second defamation against Trump in January and was awarded $83.3 million in damages.\n\nABC News and Stephanopoulos pointed to Kaplan's past rulings in a motion to dismiss Trump's defamation suit filed in May. Altonaga, however, dismissed the defendants' request, writing in part that there was a clear distinction between Carroll's words and Stephanopoulos' statements.\n\n\"Where Carroll reiterated and relayed her own experience, Stephanopoulos represented that he was describing the jury's verdict,\" read Altonaga's order, which was reviewed by Newsweek.\n\nThe judge also said that it remained unclear if Stephanopoulos' statements, like Carroll's, were \"substantially true.\" But Altonaga made clear that she was not ruling on the merits of Trump's claims, adding that the defendants \"may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan's reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos's statements were not defamatory.\"\n\n\"That is not the issue before the Court now,\" the judge wrote. \"At this stage, the Court only decides that Defendants have not satisfied their burden to show collateral estoppel should apply, and that collateral estoppel would not be fairly applied in these circumstances.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to ABC News via email Wednesday afternoon for comment on Altonaga's order.\n\nWednesday's order comes just a few weeks before ABC News is scheduled to host a presidential debate between Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

\"a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate,\" according to Judge Altonaga.\n\nThe judge's order marks another legal victory for the former president, after another federal judge dismissed a massive criminal case accusing Trump of illegally hoarding classified documents from law enforcement and then obstructing the government's attempts to get them back.\n\nHe also claimed victory after the Supreme Court determined that presidents have \"absolute\" immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts\" in office, potentially

Collateral estoppel? Defamation? This joint's got everything!\n\nPlus, Trump is super pumped about his \"BIG WIN TODAY IN HIGH FLORIDA COURT.\" (I'll give $5 to any reporter who asks him which court he's talking about.)\n\nThe case arises out of Donald Trump's wish to remind the world that the jury only found him liable for forcibly penetrating E. Jean Carroll as he pinned her against the wall of that department store dressing room. It was not able to conclude that he successfully pushed his penis inside her. And although this might meet the statutory definition of rape in some jurisdictions, New York is not one of them. So please don't call him a rapist, thankyouverymuch.\n\nTrump repeatedly made this argument in court, including in a countersuit for defamation against Carroll, only to be shot down by the trial court. In his order dismissing Trump's counterclaim, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote:\n\nIndeed, the jury's verdict in Carroll I establishes, as against Mr. Trump, the fact that Mr. Trump \"raped\" her, albeit digitally rather than with his penis. Thus, it establishes against him the substantial truth of Ms. Carroll's \"rape\" accusations. In any case, the Carroll II jury's Penal Law rape finding does not even establish, as against Ms. Carroll, Mr. Trump's contention that he did not penetrate her with his penis, i.e., that he did not rape her within the meaning of the Penal Law.\n\nOn March 10, 2024, Stephanopoulos interviewed South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, a survivor of rape, who nonetheless supports Donald Trump's presidential candidacy.\n\n\"You endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape,\" he pressed, repeating several times the claim that a jury had found Trump liable.\n\nA week later, Trump sued the network and the newsman in federal court in Florida alleging defamation per se and per quod.\n\nABC moved to dismiss, arguing that Stephanopoulos's comments were substantially true, and also that Trump was collaterally estopped from claiming that they were false thanks to Judge Kaplan's rulings. Alternatively they argued that Stephanopoulos's comments are protected under the fair report privilege as a matter of Florida law.\n\nThis morning, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga, a George W. Bush appointee, denied that motion.\n\nFirst she faulted the parties for muddying the issue of choice of law with respect to the collateral estoppel defense.\n\nCuriously, Plaintiff makes his argument \"[u]nder New York law\" but cites exclusively to federal cases from federal district courts in New York and the Second Circuit. (Resp. 7-8 (alteration added; footnote call number omitted)). Although those cases were tried and decided in New York, their holdings are, for the most part, applications and explanations of federal law and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nShe agreed with ABC that the court was bound by 11th Circuit precedent, which allows collateral estoppel as a defense at the motion to dismiss stage. After some side eye about the slipshod reasoning behind the parties' agreement that New York law governs the analysis, the judge harrumphed that \"Because the parties have reached their own consensus, the Court will not disturb their choice.\"\n\nUnder New York law, collateral estoppel applies when \"the identical issue necessarily was decided in the prior action and is decisive of the present action.\" But in the prior action, that is the Carroll v. Trump cases, the jury did not find Trump liable for rape. Judge Kaplan said that Trump met the colloquial definition of a rapist in the context of post-trial motions, specifically Trump's countersuit against Carroll. And those two things are not the same.\n\nIn another warning sign for the defendants, Judge Altonaga found that Judge Kaplan's words had no preclusive effect, even as she conceded that \"Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan's reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos's statements were not defamatory.\"\n\nThe court similarly brushed aside ABC's claim that the statements were substantially true, noting that \"Stephanopoulos was not describing Plaintiff's actions or Carroll's testimony against him; he was describing the jury's verdict.\" And the jury did not find Trump liable for rape. This was also fatal to ABC's fair report defense, since Stephanopoulos reported something that never happened.\n\nAll of which is rather ominous for ABC. Although his presidential campaign may regret the plan to spend the fall in court litigating whether Donald Trump is a normal rapist or just a digital one.", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the Law"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_dye@abovethelaw.com", "name": "Liz Dye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_estoppel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collateral estoppel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Choice of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterclaim", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Counterclaim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E.

Nancy Mace (R-SC).\n\nTrump sued the network over Stephanopoulos' claim that \"juries found\" the former president \"liable for rape.\" Last year, a civil jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump argued he was defamed because Stephanopoulos failed to make the distinction.\n\nDistrict Judge Cecilia Altonaga wrote that she \"does not consider that a reasonable jury should -- or even likely to -- find that Stephanopoulos' statements were defamatory. A jury may, after viewing the segment, conclude that there was sufficient context. A jury may also conclude that the plaintiff failed to establish other elements of his claim. But a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiff was defamed and, therefore, that dismissal is improper.\"\n\nRead the Trump-ABC decision.\n\nIn their motion to dismiss, ABC's lawyers pointed to what E. Jean Carroll Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in a subsequent ruling. \"The fact that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was 'raped' within the meaning of New York criminal law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her within the meaning that many people generally understand the word 'rape.' Indeed, as the evidence presented at trial below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump did in fact do just that,\" Kaplan wrote.\n\nThis year, in another phase of Carroll's case, a jury awarded him an additional $83.3 million in damages. The decision follows a previous jury awarding him $5 million in damages in the initial phase of the case. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations and has appealed the verdict.\n\nDuring the interview, Stephanopoulos played a video in which Mace said she was a victim of rape. Stephanopoulos first asked Mace, \"You supported Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries found him guilty of rape and defamation of the victim of that rape. How do you reconcile your support for Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?\"\n\nMace told Stephanopoulos: \"I lived 30 years with incredible shame about being raped. I didn't speak out because of the judgment and shame I felt. And that's a shame you'll never feel, George. And I'm not going to sit here on your show and be asked a question designed to shame me about another potential rape victim.\"\n\nStephanopoulos continued to question Mace on this point, while denying that he was trying to shame him.\n\nMace said Trump \"defended himself and denied that this ever happened, but he has not been convicted in a criminal court.\"\n\nAltonaga's decision was not about the merits of the case, but about whether Trump's lawsuit had reached the threshold to move forward.\n\nIn his decision, Altonaga wrote that \"Stephanopoulos' exchange with Mace lasted approximately ten minutes, during which Stephanopoulos stated ten times that a jury -- or juries -- had found the complainant responsible for the rape.\" The judge wrote that \"the jury did not find [Trump] liable for rape under New York criminal law; it was Judge Kaplan who determined that the jury's verdict amounted to liability for rape. Yet none of these particularities appear in the segment in such a way that a reasonable viewer would have unquestionably understood what was happening. [ABC News] now brief in details.\"\n\nThe judge also rejected the network's defense that it was protected by Florida's fair reporting privilege, writing that it \"does not protect the media when the omission of important context renders a report misleading.\"\n\nABC had no immediate comment.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump called the decision a \"great victory\" and \"a great day for our country.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

Drivers are no longer required to get quotes from just a few known insurance companies. Also, local and regional insurers can provide lower insurance rates for the same services. Accurate insurance estimates. Online quotes can only be accurate if the customers provide accurate and real info about their car models and driving history. Lying about past driving incidents can make the price estimates to be lower, but when dealing with an insurance company lying to them is useless.

Jean Carroll.\n\nA federal judge in Florida on Wednesday allowed former President Donald J. Trump's defamation suit against ABC News to move forward, rejecting an effort by the television network to dismiss the litigation as spurious.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in March, argued that ABC's star anchor, George Stephanopoulos, defamed Mr. Trump by saying on-air numerous times, in a March 10 segment on \"This Week,\" that the former president had been found liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nMr. Trump was found liable last year in a Manhattan civil case for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll. The jury did not find Mr. Trump liable on a technical charge of rape, which is narrowly defined in New York State law. But the judge in the case later asserted that Mr. Trump had been held liable for rape \"as many people commonly understand the word.\"\n\nThere is typically a high bar in court to prove that a journalist defamed a public figure. But the Florida judge, Cecilia Altonaga of United States District Court in Miami, denied ABC's initial attempt to have the case thrown out. \"A jury may, upon viewing the segment, find there was sufficient context,\" she wrote. \"But a reasonable jury could conclude Plaintiff was defamed and, as a result, dismissal is inappropriate.\"\n\nABC News declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, gloated about the ruling, calling it \"A BIG WIN\" against \"ABC FAKE NEWS.\" He also referred to Mr. Stephanopoulos by a mocking nickname and called him \"LIDDLE.\"\n\nTheodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer who regularly represents media outlets in defamation cases, said he was concerned by the judge's ruling. \"This is a very troubling, and incorrect, application of defamation law that clashes with basic First Amendment principles, and that will chill reporting on legal proceedings and issues of great public interest and concern,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nMr. Trump has filed a series of unsuccessful defamation suits against media organizations; federal judges have dismissed his suits against The Washington Post, CNN and The New York Times.\n\nABC News is scheduled to host a presidential debate on Sept. 10. The network is moving ahead with those plans, but Mr. Trump has publicly wavered on his commitment in the last few days, saying he agreed to the debate with the understanding that President Biden would be his opponent.\n\nMr. Stephanopoulos, who is named as a co-defendant in Mr. Trump's lawsuit, conducted a high-stakes interview with Mr. Biden earlier this month in the wake of the president's diminished debate performance. The anchor later apologized after he was surreptitiously recorded saying he did not believe Mr. Biden could handle another term in office.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_m_grynbaum@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael M.

Jean Carroll civil case, can move forward.\n\nIn May, lawyers for ABC and Stephanopoulos asked Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga to throw out the lawsuit \"with prejudice,\" defending Stephanopoulos' statements as \"substantially true,\" asserting they were protected by Florida's fair report privilege, and arguing that Trump's claims were collaterally estopped.\n\n\"In this case, former President Trump seeks to re-litigate a meritless theory of defamation that he has already lost twice in New York. Mr. Trump is collaterally estopped from doing so here,\" ABC argued earlier. \"And if this Court were to reach the merits, at bottom, this case asserts that even after a jury has found that a person committed a violent sexual assault, it is defamatory to say that the person committed a 'rape.' That is not a proposition Florida law recognizes.\" For Altonaga, however, she agrees with Trump's \"position on each\" at this point of the litigation.\n\n\"To be clear, the Court is not reaching the merits of Plaintiff's claims. Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan's reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos's statements were not defamatory. That is not the issue before the Court now,\" the judge wrote first of the collateral estoppel argument. \"At this stage, the Court only decides that Defendants have not satisfied their burden to show collateral estoppel should apply, and that collateral estoppel would not be fairly applied in these circumstances.\"\n\nRead more: https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/judge-who-reportedly-urged-cannon-to-step-aside-from-mar-a-lago-case-declines-to-throw-out-trumps-defamation-suit-against-abc-stephanopolous/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief judge (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E.

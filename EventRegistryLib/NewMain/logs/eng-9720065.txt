All but two of the Texas stores listed for divestiture are in North Texas (list below). The North Texas list includes six Market Street locations, five Albertsons locations, and 15 Tom Thumb locations. Two Randalls locations in Houston and Galveston will also be sold.\n\nThe proposed merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons was announced on Oct. 14, 2022. However, in February, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger, saying the deal was anticompetitive and would eliminate fierce competition, leading to higher prices for shoppers and lower employee wages.\n\nThe FTC said Kroger and Albertsons planned to divest several hundred stores and other assets to C&S Wholesale Grocers but questioned whether C&S, which currently operates just 23 supermarkets and a single retail pharmacy, could remain competitive against such a behemoth that after the merger would operate more than 5,000 stores and employ nearly 700,000 people across 48 states.\n\n\"C&S would face significant obstacles stitching together the various parts and pieces from Kroger and Albertsons into a functioning business -- let alone a successful competitor against a combined Kroger and Albertsons,\" the FTC said in their complaint.\n\nIn April, Kroger and Albertsons modified their proposed divestiture package to include another 166 stores, bringing the total sold to C&S to 579. The modified package also included non-store assets, including a dairy in Colorado and six distribution facilities that would enable C&S \"to operate competitively following the completion of the proposed merger.\"\n\nThroughout the merger process, Kroger and Albertsons pledged that no stores would close and no jobs would be lost.

Two Albertsons stores are on the list of those to be sold. The rest are Safeways.\n\nKroger, which owns King Soopers and City Market stores, and Albertsons, parent company of Safeway, announced the proposed $24.6 billion merger in October 2022. Since then, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has filed a lawsuit opposing the merger on grounds that it would eliminate competition and harm shoppers, workers and suppliers.\n\nIn June, a Denver district judge rejected a motion by Kroger and Albertsons Companies to dismiss Weiser's lawsuit.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued in February to block the merger between the grocery giants, saying it would eliminate competition and drive up prices for millions of Americans. An administrative hearing by the FTC is scheduled to start July 31.\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against the merger in January.\n\nKroger and Albertsons have said merging would better position them to compete against national, nonunion discount grocers such as Walmart and Costco. Kroger has said the merger would generate $1 billion in higher wages, expanded benefits, long-term job security and a strong unionized workforce.\n\nBut the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which opposes the consolidation, believes the grocers released the list of stores Tuesday in an attempt to influence the courts and create the perception that the merger is close to being final. Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, which represents workers in Colorado and Wyoming, said the union had requested the list of stores targeted for sale several times but didn't get it.\n\n\"The workers wanted to know. It causes anxiety for our membership, it causes a lot of uncertainty,\" Cordova said. \"The companies have not been transparent during this whole process.\"\n\nKroger said in an email that from the start, it has committed to sharing information, including the specific list of affected locations and associates.\n\n\"We are now at the point in the process where we can begin providing those details. Because we began to inform affected associates, we were able to share the list publicly. We reached out to the local unions at the same time we were notifying associates,\" Kroger said in its statement.\n\nSince announcing the proposed merger, the supermarket chains have increased the number of stores it would sell to C&S Wholesale Grocers. Kroger and Albertsons initially said the plan was to sell about 50 stores in Colorado to the Texas-based company.\n\nThe latest plan includes selling a total of 579 stores along with six distribution centers and one dairy plant.\n\nKroger owns 148 stores in Colorado, which operate under the King Soopers and City Market banners. Albertsons operates 105 Safeway and Albertsons stores in the state.\n\nThe $1.9 billion deal to sell some of the companies' stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers is intended to spur competition when Kroger and Albertsons consolidate. Cordova said employees fear a repeat of what happened when Albertsons acquired Safeway in 2015. Haggen, a small supermarket chain based in Washington state, bought some of the stores and in less than a year filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAs a result, roughly 40 stores closed permanently in Colorado and Wyoming, Cordova said. The union doesn't believe C&S has enough experience with grocery stores and pharmacies to compete with a consolidated Kroger and Albertsons.\n\n\"These are major grocers where people go for their food, fuel and pharmacy,\" Cordova said.\n\nUnion officials have said fewer options in the grocery industry will lead to higher prices for customers and erode union members' bargaining power.\n\n\"It's not (President) Biden who's responsible for these prices. It's corporate America that's allowed to get away with all this consolidation,\" Cordova said.\n\nAn Albertsons' spokesperson said in an email that both companies have committed to no frontline workers losing their jobs and no stores closing as a result of the merger.\n\n\"C&S is a well-capitalized industry leader in wholesale grocery supply -- currently serving more than 7,500 independent supermarkets, retail chain stores, and military bases -- with a strong track record as a successful grocery retailer,\" Albertsons said in the statement.\n\nAsked if stores sold to C&S would retain the Safeway name, a C&S spokeswoman said in an email that the transaction is not final and the agreement is subject to Kroger and Albertsons resolving the pending cases in court.\n\n\"The purchase of these stores will enable C&S to be one of the leading grocery retailers in the United States,\" the statement said. \"In order to ensure these stores continue to thrive, we also will be welcoming hundreds of highly skilled grocery retail veterans and tens of thousands of store associates from Kroger and Albertsons who are currently responsible for these stores.\"", "source": {"uri":

The $25 billion merger proposal would likely constitute one of the biggest mergers in retail history, and create one of the country's largest employers behind Walmart and Amazon.\n\nBut federal regulators have signaled skepticism about the deal, which remains subject to conditions and approval.\n\nTo sweeten the pot, Kroger and Albertsons have agreed to divest from hundreds of stores and sell them to competitor C & S Wholesale Grocers, owners of the Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union chains, for $2.9 billion. The move would theoretically assure competition in regions that would otherwise be dominated by the new grocery megalith. Six distribution centers and one dairy plant were also included in the proposed sale.\n\nKroger has already begun informing employees at affected locations that they will become employees of C&S after the close of the merger, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWill a Delaware supermarket be affected by the Kroger-Albertsons merger?\n\nJust a single Delaware store will be sold if the Kroger-Albertsons merger is approved, according to the announcement from Tuesday.\n\nThe Harris Teeter at 31221 Americana Parkway in Selbyville would be sold to C & S Wholesalers. No timeline has been announced for the transfer, if the merger passes regulator muster. C & S Wholesalers did not respond to requests for comment from USA Today Network on Tuesday.\n\nNo Pennsylvania or New Jersey stores would be sold as part of the merger. Though some states will see dozens of stores change hands, the northern part of the Mid-Atlantic is dominated by Albertsons stores such as Acme but is not a strong region for Kroger stores.\n\nFour Harris Teeters in Maryland are also on the list: 10125 Ward Rd. in Dunkirk; 28528 Marlboro Ave. in Easton; 14101 Darnestown Rd. in Germantown; and 18169 Town Center Dr. in Olney.\n\nEspecially in western states such as Arizona, Oregon and Colorado where Kroger and Albertsons are in heavy competition, dozens of stores in each state would be sold off after a merger.\n\nWhat supermarket brands are owned by Albertsons, Kroger and C & S Wholesalers?\n\nAlbertsons owns more than 2,200 stores in 34 states, according to its website. It's best-known brands include Albertsons, Safeway, and Acme, as well as Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Pavilions, Star Market, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci's Food Lover's Market.\n\nKroger owns more than 2,700 stores in 35 states. In addition to Kroger-branded stores, Kroger owns Harris Teeter, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Frys, Dillons and a host of other brands that include Baker's, City Market, Foods Co, Gerbes, Jay C, King Soopers, Mariano's, Pay-Less Super Markets, Pick'n Save, QFC, Ralphs, Ruler, and Smith's.\n\nC & S Wholesalers runs a network of wholesale and distribution that services 7,500 stores nationwide. Its retail footprint is much smaller. Grand Union, a recently revived brand in New York and Vermont, boasts 11 stores. Piggly Wiggly comprises more than 500 locations in 18 states, according to its website, many of which independently operated.\n\nIs the Kroger-Albertsons merger guaranteed to go through?\n\nThe deal still faces headwinds.\n\nThe merger was announced in October 2022 but the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop it in February. The merger represents approximately 20% of the U.S. grocery market, according to the USDA, and would affect one out of six grocery laborers if approved, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSales of Kroger or Albertsons locations to C&S, while disruptive in the short term, were designed to mollify regulator concerns about competition. In April, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statment the divestiture \"adresses concerns raised by regulators, and will further ensure that C&S can successfully operate the divested stores as they are operated today.\"\n\nMany union leaders also oppose the merger.\n\n\"We remain focused on stopping the proposed mega-merger for the same reasons we have stated since it was first announced over 20 months ago -- because we know it would harm workers, it would harm shoppers, it would harm suppliers and communities, and it is illegal,\" read a Tuesday statement from United Food & Commercial Workers.\n\nThat said, a branch of the grocery union in Idaho broke ranks and said it supported the move specifically because of the planned sell-offs, in the belief that C & S Wholesaler Grocers was more supportive of workers than either Kroger or Albertsons.\n\nWhat's the full list of stores that would be sold by Kroger and Albertson's after a merger?\n\nVirginia\n\nContributing: James Powell, USA Today; Alexander Coolidge, Cincinatti Enquirer.

The two retailers operate thousands of stores throughout the United States.\n\nIn a bid last year to alleviate anti-competition concerns, Albertsons and Kroger said they planned to sell hundreds of stores to New Hampshire-based C&S Wholesale Grocers, owner of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket brand and one of the nation's largest wholesale grocers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Albertsons and Kroger released a list of the 579 stores included in the $2.9 billion C&S deal, including 20 in Snohomish and Island counties.\n\nIn a recent statement, all three companies have said no stores will be closed, \"all frontline associates will remain employed and all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue.\" In a company statement, C&S added that it committed to \"further investing for growth.\"\n\nDespite those assurances, in a statement Wednesday, the Teamsters union, which represents some grocery workers, said it is still \"vehemently\" opposed to the merger.\n\n\"The proposed consolidation threatens jobs, wages, and benefits for thousands of workers across the country,\" the union said. \"It risks reducing competition and harming communities that rely on these stores for essential goods and services,\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $24.6 billion deal, alleging it would saddle consumers with higher prices for groceries and fewer choices.\n\nAlbertsons and Kroger have said the merger will allow them to compete with the nation's three non-unionized retail giants Walmart, Costco and Amazon.\n\nThe planned divestiture includes more than a dozen brands in 18 states and Washington D.C.: Albertsons, Carrs, Eagle, Haggen, Harris Teeter, Jewel-Osco, Lucky Store, Marianos, Market Street, Pavilions, QFC, Randalls, Safeway, Tom Thumb and Vons.\n\nKroger, with brands including QFC and Fred Meyer, operates about 120 stores in Washington while Albertsons operates more than 220 across the state.\n\nSnohomish County is home to two of Albertsons namesake supermarkets and more than 15 Safeway stores. Kroger operates about 20 QFC and Fred Meyer stores in the county.\n\nIn total, they plan to divest 124 Washington stores.\n\nAlbertsons and Kroger also plan to divest nine distribution centers in Auburn, Washington, Arizona, Colorado and Utah as well as a plant in Colorado.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, which is seeking a court order to stop the merger on antitrust grounds, in February dismissed the two companies' original plan to sell 413 stores and other assets to C&S as \"far short of mitigating the lost competition between Kroger and Albertsons,\" the agency said.\n\nKroger and Albertsons responded with a revised plan in April to sell 579 stores to C&S.\n\nThe release of the this week's planned divestiture list comes about six weeks before a federal judge in Oregon will consider an FTC request to obtain a temporary restraining order to block the merger, reports Grocery Dive.\n\nThat hearing is scheduled is scheduled for Aug. 26. If the merger is completed, the combined company will operate more than 5,000 stores. In a statement, the company also said no stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities will close as a result of the merger.\n\nHere are the local stores Albertsons and Kroger plan to

Two Albertsons stores are on the list of those to be sold. The rest are Safeways.\n\nKroger, which owns King Soopers and City Market stores, and Albertsons, parent company of Safeway, announced the proposed $24.6 billion merger in October 2022. Since then, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has filed a lawsuit opposing the merger on grounds that it would eliminate competition and harm shoppers, workers and suppliers.\n\nIn June, a Denver district judge rejected a motion by Kroger and Albertsons Companies to dismiss Weiser's lawsuit.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued in February to block the merger between the grocery giants, saying it would eliminate competition and drive up prices for millions of Americans.\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against the merger in January.\n\nKroger and Albertsons have said merging would better position them to compete against national, nonunion discount grocers such as Walmart and Costco. Kroger has said the merger would generate $1 billion in higher wages, expanded benefits, long-term job security and a strong unionized workforce.\n\nBut the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which opposes the consolidation, believes the grocers released the list of stores Tuesday in an attempt to influence the courts and create the perception that the merger is close to being final. Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, which represents workers in Colorado and Wyoming, said the union had requested the list of stores targeted for sale several times but didn't get it.\n\n\"The workers wanted to know. It causes anxiety for our membership, it causes a lot of uncertainty,\" Cordova said. \"The companies have not been transparent during this whole process.\"\n\nKroger said in an email that from the start, it has committed to sharing information, including the specific list of affected locations and associates.\n\n\"We are now at the point in the process where we can begin providing those details. Because we began to inform affected associates, we were able to share the list publicly. We reached out to the local unions at the same time we were notifying associates,\" Kroger said in its statement.\n\nCordova said the union was notified that the Federal Trade Commission will hold an administrative hearing on the merger starting July 31. The FTC didn't respond to a question about the hearing.\n\nSince announcing the proposed merger, the supermarket chains have increased the number of stores it would sell to C&S Wholesale Grocers. Kroger and Albertsons initially said the plan was to sell about 50 stores in Colorado to the Texas-based company.\n\nThe latest plan includes selling a total of 579 stores along with six distribution centers and one dairy plant.\n\nKroger owns 148 stores in Colorado, which operate under the King Soopers and City Market banners. Albertsons operates 105 Safeway and Albertsons stores in the state.\n\nThe $1.9 billion deal to sell some of the companies' stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers is intended to spur competition when Kroger and Albertsons consolidate. Cordova said employees fear a repeat of what happened when Albertsons acquired Safeway in 2015. Haggen, a small supermarket chain based in Washington state, bought some of the stores and in less than a year filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAs a result, roughly 40 stores closed permanently in Colorado and Wyoming, Cordova said. The union doesn't believe C&S has enough experience with grocery stores and pharmacies to compete with a consolidated Kroger and Albertsons.\n\n\"These are major grocers where people go for their food, fuel and pharmacy,\" Cordova said.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judith_kohler@denverpost.com", "name": "Judith

The stores agreed to the sale as an anti-trust measure required by federal regulators overseeing the companies' proposed merger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores in the US. In addition to its Kroger stores, the company also operates Ralphs and Harris Teeter stores, while Albertsons operates its own stores plus Safeway, Acme, and Jewel-Osco stores.\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission sued to block the companies' merger in February, citing the potential for the proposed mega-grocer to drive up prices for groceries and reduce wages for store workers.\n\nKroger and Albertsons initially offered to sell off 413 stores to C&S Wholesale, but regulators refused that deal, arguing that it would have left C&S with a smattering of stores in isolated markets and that it would have little impact on curbing the dominance of the Kroger-Albertsons entity.\n\nThe companies then suggested adding an additional 166 stores, six distribution centers, and a diary plant to sweeten the deal.\n\nThe states where the most stores will be sold are Washington, with 124 stores, Arizona with 101, Colorado with 91, and California with 63.\n\nThe new plan also hands over the Haggen store brand name to C&S Wholesale, and gives C&S the Albertsons brand name in Arizona and Colorado.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, C&S would continue to operate all of the stores sold and honor any existing labor agreements at the grocers.\n\nRegulators have not announced if they plan to accept the deal. Kroger and Albertsons have argued the merger is necessary for them to compete with mega-retailers like Walmart and Amazon.\n\nWhile the companies wait on a decision from the FTC, a coalition of United Food & Commercial Workers local unions -- which represent grocery workers -- has continued to oppose the merger.\n\n\"Today's announcement changes nothing,\" the unions said in a statement. \"We remain focused on stopping the proposed mega-merger for the same reasons we have stated since it was first announced over 20 months ago - because we know it would harm workers, it would harm shoppers, it would harm suppliers and communities, and it is illegal.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C&S_Wholesale_Grocers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C&S Wholesale Grocers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Teeter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Teeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralphs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel-Osco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewel-Osco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Markets", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acme Markets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distribution center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haggen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Food and Commercial Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/13/17/newFile-3.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720065", "eventUri": "eng-9720065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nAs Kroger and Albertsons attempt to merge two of the nation's largest chains of grocery stores, the companies announced plans to divest from 579 stores across 18 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nAs part of the plan, the stores would be sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers, LLC. Some Harris Teeter, Vons, Mariano's and Safeway locations would be included in the sale.\n\nThe companies put the full list of locations set to be sold on a website. The sale would also include six distribution centers and one processing plant.\n\nRELATED STORY | Kroger 'embarrassed' to learn it advertised peach truck with doctored images from Nashville business\n\nThe companies had set early 2024 as a target to complete the merger, but the Federal Trade Commission has sued to block the move. The FTC alleged that the deal is \"anticompetitive\" and would lead to higher prices and fewer options for consumers.\n\nAdditionally, eight states have challenged the merger under similar grounds.\n\n\"This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,\" said Henry Liu, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. \"Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Kroger CEO took an 18% pay cut but still made $15.5 million in 2023\n\nThe United Food & Commercial Workers said it remains opposed to the merger following Tuesday's announcement.\n\n\"Today's announcement changes nothing,\" the union said. \"The merger is not a done deal, far from it.

They have claimed that the merger would lower costs, which they would then pass on to consumers.\n\nIn November, leaders from Kroger and Albertsons testified in support of the merger before a skeptical Congressional panel. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen stated the merger would be beneficial to employees.\n\n\"We also committed $1 billion to continue raising associate wages and comprehensive, industry-leading benefits, including quality and affordable health care, continuing education, wellbeing, and financial literacy programs,\" he said. \"Kroger employs one of America's largest unionized workforces, and this merger secures the long-term future of union jobs by establishing a more competitive alternative to large, non-union retailers.\"\n\nIf the merger is allowed to proceed, Kroger and Albertsons would have 4,414 locations throughout the U.S. The sale of 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers would give that company 741 total locations, which is more than many large grocery chains such as Whole Foods, Costco and Trader Joe's.", "source": {"uri": "fox13now.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSTU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_boggs@fox13now.com", "name": "Justin Boggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Teeter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Teeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vons", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Distribution center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C&S_Wholesale_Grocers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C&S Wholesale Grocers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Food and Commercial Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_McMullen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodney McMullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Costco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whole Foods Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trader Joe's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e274a71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd8%2Fb5%2Fc4e8b79f4b08b7b0f182a7310197%2Fap17166668222023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720065", "eventUri": "eng-9720065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

What we know", "body": "With nearly three dozen Mariano's and Jewel-Osco stores in Illinois expected to be sold as part of a potential merger between popular grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons, what will it mean if your local shop is on the list?\n\nAs they continue to pursue a blockbuster merger, Kroger and Albertsons identified hundreds of stores across the U.S., which they plan to sell as part of a divestiture agreement.\n\nHere's what this could mean:\n\nThe sales talks come after regulators raised concerns about their potential merger leading to a lack of competition.\n\nIn response to that concern, a total of 579 stores across the two companies' portfolios would be sold to C&S Wholesale Grocer, according to a release,\n\nThe companies have pledged that no stores will be closed as a result of the merger, and all collective bargaining agreements will remain in place.\n\n\"We have reached an agreement with C&S for an updated divestiture package that maintains Kroger's commitments to customers, associates and communities, addresses concerns raised by regulators, and will further ensure that C&S can successfully operate the divested stores as they are operated today,\" said Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chairman and CEO, in a statement earlier this year.\n\nC&S told NBC Chicago that the purchased stores will mean \"welcoming hundreds of highly skilled grocery retail veterans and tens of thousands of store associates from Kroger and Albertsons who are currently responsible for these stores.\"\n\n\"Their skill and knowledge, along with our leading wholesale and supply expertise will undoubtedly ensure that these stores continue to successfully serve their communities for many generations to come,\" the company said in a statement. \"C&S acquiring these stores also will benefit store associates, customers, consumers, communities and our wholesale customers.\"\n\nFurther details on potential changes in store for the impacted locations remained unclear.\n\nThe initial news of the divestment sale was released in April, but this week Kroger and Albertsons released the full list of Illinois stores that will be impacted by the sale this week.\n\nMost of the affected stores in Illinois carry the Mariano's brand, while a total of four Jewel-Osco locations in the city and suburbs will be included in the sale.\n\nAlbertsons currently operates 188 Jewel-Osco locations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, while Kroger operates an unspecified number of locations in Illinois under its own banner.\n\nHere is the full list of stores that will be impacted by the sale:\n\nEven with the revised divestiture agreement, there are still questions about whether the moves will be enough to earn federal approval of the merger. According to the Washington Post, critics have raised concerns about C&S's \"lack of experience handling a large fleet of stores,\" but both Kroger and Albertsons say they agreed to provide additional corporate and office infrastructure to help alleviate those issues.\n\nIllinois is one of eight states that signed on as party to a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission seeking to block the merger, citing alleged violations of federal antitrust law. The suit alleges the merger would eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.\n\nA court hearing is scheduled in Oregon on Aug. 26.\n\nKroger and Albertsons first agreed to merge in October 2022. The companies said a merger would help them better compete with Walmart, Amazon, Costco and other big rivals. Together, Kroger and Albertsons would control around 13% of the U.S. grocery market; Walmart controls 22%, according to an Associated Press report citing J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman.\n\nDuring a call on June 27 with investors, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said the deal will bring lower prices to customers.\n\n\"It's been our strategy for over 15 years to lower prices,\" he said, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. \"We believe this merger creates the best environment in the near and long-term to bring lower prices and more choices to more people.\"\n\nThe deal also includes 10 billion meals donated to combat hunger and to invest more than $1 billion in employee wages and benefits, according to the publication.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel-Osco", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewel-Osco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_McMullen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodney McMullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAQ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WMAQ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

These Pueblo supermarkets are on the list", "body": "Two Pueblo supermarkets could be sold to a new owner as the parent companies of Safeway and Albertsons seek to offload hundreds of properties to help gain approval for their planned $24.6 billion merger.\n\nIf regulators approve the merger between Kroger and Albertsons, more than 90 Colorado Safeway and Albertsons stores -- including the Safeway at 1231 S. Prairie Ave. and the Albertsons at 1601 U.S. Highway 50 West -- would be transferred to C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S owns the Piggly Wiggly grocery brand and operates the \"largest wholesale grocery supply company in the U.S,\" according to its website.\n\nKroger and Albertsons released a list Tuesday of 579 stores that would be sold, with 91 of those in Colorado -- the third most of any state, trailing only Washington and Arizona. Eighty-nine of the Colorado locations to be sold are Safeway stores; two are Albertsons, with one each in Pueblo and Durango.\n\nThe merger of the two companies was first announced in October 2022, but the Federal Trade Commission sued to kill the deal in February, according to USA Today. The merger represents approximately 20% of the U.S. grocery market, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, and would affect one out of six grocery workers if approved, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA Today reported.\n\nThe proposed sale was first agreed to by the two companies in April, at which point Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen stated in a news release that the plan would \"ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed.\"\n\nMcMullen also stated that all existing collective bargaining agreements would continue and that employees would continue to receive health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages.\n\nIn suing to block the merger, the FTC argued that Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would \"lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,\" Henry Liu, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said in a Feb. 26 statement.\n\n\"Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating,\" Liu said.\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed his own lawsuit prior to the FTC's, which also seeks to block the merger. In a news release, Weiser echoed the FTC's arguments, saying he believes the merger would eliminate competition between Kroger and Albertsons and consolidate a concentrated market.\n\n\"Coloradans are concerned about undue consolidation and its harmful impacts on consumers, workers, and suppliers,\" he said in the release.\n\nWeiser hosted 19 town halls across Colorado prior to filing the lawsuit on behalf of the state, including one in Pueblo, and said those conversations left him \"convinced that Coloradans think this merger between the two supermarket chains would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.\"\n\nKroger officials then issued a statement saying the company was \"disappointed\" in Weiser's decision and would defend the proposed merger in court as it would result in the \"best outcomes for Colorado consumers.\"\n\n\"Blocking this merger would only serve to strengthen larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, by allowing them to maintain and increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry,\" a Kroger spokesperson said.\n\n\"In contrast, Kroger and Albertsons companies merging will bring lower prices to more customers, strengthen and create good-paying union jobs, and bring more fresh, affordable food to more communities.\"\n\nKroger operates 148 stores in Colorado, all of which are King Soopers and City Market locations. Albertsons manages 105 Safeway Albertsons stores across the state.\n\nMore Pueblo news: Pueblo police, fire department report few injuries and citations on Fourth of July\n\nChieftain Editor Zach Hillstrom can be reached at zhillstrom@gannett.com, or on X, at @ZachHillstrom.

That amount is double what was previously authorized to pay the law firm and around one-quarter of the state's total antitrust budget for the 2023-25 period, according to the Times.\n\nThe state

Is yours on this list? - East Idaho News", "body": "POCATELLO (Idaho Statesman) -- Kroger and Albertsons have released a list of all the stores they would sell to another company if federal regulators approve their plan to merge. The list includes 10 Albertsons stores in Idaho, six of which are in Boise -- the city where the grocery chain was born 85 years ago. One is in eastern Idaho.\n\nCincinnati-based Kroger, which operates the Fred Meyer chain in the Northwest, is trying to acquire Albertsons, the Boise-based chain founded by Joe Albertson in 1939. The companies say the merger will help them compete more effectively in the shifting grocery market, where they face competition from Walmart, Amazon, Boise's WinCo Foods and other stores.\n\nThe merger is in trouble, as the Federal Trade Commission and multiple state attorneys general (but not Idaho's) have sued to block it, citing antitrust concerns. The FTC's case is working its way through a federal court.\n\nIf the companies win the fight, they would sell the 10 Albertsons Idaho stores and 569 other stores under assorted banners to C&S Wholesale Grocers LLC, a little-known business that has operated primarily as a wholesaler so far.\n\nRELATED | Kroger, Albertsons -- still hoping to merge -- agree to sell more stores to satisfy regulators\n\nRELATED | Why does the US government think a Kroger-Albertsons merger would be bad for grocery shoppers?\n\nIt wasn't immediately known why these 10 stores were chosen, nor what names the Idaho stores would receive. Kroger's deal assigns licensing rights to C&S for Albertsons-brand stores in California and Wyoming but not in Idaho. C&S operates two retail grocery chains: Piggly Wiggly in the South, Midwest and Northeast, and Grand Union in New York and Vermont.\n\nA Statesman email to Albertsons on Tuesday requesting additional details was not immediately returned, and calls to a company media line were not connected.\n\nKroger and Albertsons originally said they would sell 13 Idaho Albertsons stores but reduced that to 10 in April.\n\nAmong the stores not on the divestiture list released Tuesday is the one at 16th and State streets in downtown Boise, the site of founder Joe Albertson's original store in 1939.\n\nRELATED | US sues to block merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, saying it could push prices higher\n\nThe companies have promised regulators, employees and the public that no divested stores will close, no \"front-line\" workers will lose their jobs, all collective-bargaining agreements will be honored, and all divested stores will continue to benefit from investment as a result of the merger.\n\nThey also promised to lower prices.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission isn't buying that last promise. The agency sued in February. The Idaho Statesman reported then that the FTC said Kroger's acquisition, the largest proposed supermarket merger in U.S. history, would \"eliminate fierce competition\" between the two grocery giants and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nNine states, including Oregon and Nevada, joined the FTC's lawsuit. Washington state and Colorado have filed their own lawsuits.\n\nA union local that says it represents about 25,000 Kroger and Albertsons workers, including 265 in North Idaho, said the release of the store list \"changes nothing.\"\n\n\"We remain focused on stopping the proposed mega-merger for the same reasons we have stated since it was first announced over 20 months ago -- because we know it would harm workers, it would harm shoppers, it would harm suppliers and communities, and it is illegal,\" the United Food and Commercial Workers 3000 said in an email.\n\nBut a UFCW local that represents some Albertsons workers elsewhere in Idaho backs the merger. UFCW Local 555 said in February that its leaders were impressed by C&S's management.\n\nDivesting those stores would reduce Albertsons' Idaho footprint to 27 stores, a distribution center in Meridian and whatever is kept of its corporate headquarters operation in Boise.\n\nAlbertsons is Idaho's fourth-largest employer, with more than 5,000 workers in the state, the Idaho Department of Labor reports. It is the biggest employer nationwide of any Idaho company, with a reported 285,000 workers.\n\nC&S is owned by New Hampshire billionaire Rick Cohen, who is \"the third generation of the Cohen family to lead the company,\" according to a bio on C&S's website.", "source": {"uri": "eastidahonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Idaho News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Albertsons, which is based in Boise, Idaho, has operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco, and Shaw's.\n\nThe two companies proposed the merger in 2022 in order to help them compete against mega-chains like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco. According to the Associated Press, if Kroger and Albertsons were combined, that would give them control of 13 percent of the grocery market versus Walmart's 22 percent.\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit to block the merger, stating that it would eliminate competition and lead to higher prices. Inflation has already raised grocery prices by 11.4 percent in 2022 and another 5 percent in 2023.\n\nA hearing has been set for July 31.\n\nTo prove that the merger would not result in a monopoly, Kroger and Albertsons have agreed to sell 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a supplier based in New Hampshire that operates a total of 23 supermarkets including 11 Grand Union stores in New York as well as owning the Piggly Wiggly brand.\n\nIn a statement, C&S said that it was \"committed to ensuring zero stores will close as a result of the merger, all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading benefits alongside bargained-for wages.\"\n\nThe two chains originally proposed selling 413 stores in locations where their operations overlap, but have added another 166 stores for a total of 579 in Washington (124), Arizona (101), Colorado (91), California (63), Oregon (62), Illinois (35), Texas (28), Nevada (16), and Alaska (18).\n\nStore brands affected would include Tom Thumb, Randalls, Market Street, Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, QFC, Mariano's, Carrs, Harris Teeter, and

A distribution center in Auburn is also one of six that will be sold in the deal. (A PDF of all the stores, distribution centers and plants involved in this plan can be seen here.)\n\nOf the 124 stores impacted in this plan, Seattle will see the most change as 16 stores will be affected. In addition, nine stores in Vancouver, Washington, are on the list. Tacoma, Bellevue and Bellingham each have five locations on the list as well.\n\nIn addition, 62 stores in Oregon will change ownership.\n\nThe combined companies announced earlier this year the plan to sell the stores across multiple states for $2.9 billion to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a New Hampshire-based company that includes the Piggly Wiggly Supermarkets chains as part of its portfolio.\n\nKroger currently operates Fred Meyer and Quality Food Center (QFC) stores and Albertsons owns Safeway and Haggen. However, the QFC and Haggen banners would be sold to C&S as part of the deal that has been revised multiple times. Kroger operates 55 QFC stores in Washington.\n\nPrevious coverage: Kroger, Albertsons alter their merger plans, include Haggen in new deal\n\nC&S would also license the Albertsons banner in California and Wyoming and the Safeway banner in Arizona and Colorado. C&S would also get access to some private-label brands in the stores. Under the proposal, C&S would keep all of the stores open and honor any labor agreements.\n\n\"We are confident this expanded divestiture package will provide the stores, supporting assets and expert operators needed to ensure these stores continue to successfully serve their communities for many generations to come,\" C&S CEO Eric Winn said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nThe companies have started notifying staff at affected locations, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported. McMullen told impacted workers they will become employees of C&S Wholesale Grocers after the transaction closes. Until that time comes, those people at affected stores will remain as Kroger and Albertsons staff. C&S has committed to transferring pay and health plans and assuming all collective bargaining agreements, McMullen added, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the trade publication Supermarket News, Kroger issued a statement following the list's release, saying the divestiture plan \"is critical to bringing the meaningful and measurable benefits of our merger with Albertsons to associates, customers and communities across America.\"\n\n\"C&S committed to ensuring zero stores will close as a result of the merger, all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading benefits alongside bargained-for wages,\" the statement added.\n\nKroger went on to praise C&S while noting that the company's \"strong operational focus coupled with its experienced management team and financial resources will position it to successfully operate divested stores for years to come.\"\n\nIn response, a coalition of United Food & Commercial Workers local unions -- UFCW 7, UFCW 324, UFCW 400, UFCW 770 and UFCW 3000 -- released their own statement about the development.\n\n\"Today's announcement changes nothing. The merger is not a done deal, far from it. We remain focused on stopping the proposed mega-merger for the same reasons we have stated since it was first announced over 20 months ago -- because we know it would harm workers, it would harm shoppers, it would harm suppliers and communities, and it is illegal,\" the statement begins.\n\nEarlier union comments: History is doomed to repeat itself if Kroger-Albertsons merger happens\n\nThe unions' statement also noted the previous rejection of the Kroger-Albertsons merger by the attorneys general in Colorado, Phil Weiser, and Washington, Bob Ferguson.\n\nWhile Ferguson has not yet officially commented on the release the list of stores to be sold, he has been vocal about his concerns about a potential Kroger-Albertsons merger in the past.\n\n\"If Kroger and Albertson's merge, they will - simply put - dwarf the competition,\" Ferguson said when he filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state in January. \"Shoppers will have fewer choices and less competition, and that results in higher prices.\"\n\nWashington lawsuit: Kroger-Albertson merger 'bad' for consumers, attorney general's office says\n\nFerguson has claimed C&S is a small operation he predicts would be quickly overwhelmed by competition from the newly combined Kroger-Albertsons stores.\n\nHe compared it to when Albertsons merged with Safeway in 2015. Under a divestiture plan, they sold 146 stores to regional supermarket chain Haggen, which went bankrupt a year later.\n\nAlso, before the store list became public, Ferguson issued a separate press release Monday to announce the resolution of a price-fixing antitrust lawsuit against companies who artificially raised the cost of chicken in Washington, he said part of the $37.7 million he was able to recover will be used to block the proposed Kroger-Albertsons merger.\n\n\"The remaining funds will be used for future antitrust work, including the office's challenge of the proposed merger of Kroger and Albertsons,\" the release reads. \"The attorney general's Antitrust Division receives 100% of its funding from successful case outcomes.\"\n\nThe two grocery chains first announced their proposed merger in October 2022.\n\nHowever, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced in late February that it has sued to block what would be largest proposed supermarket merger in U.S. history, alleging the deal is \"anticompetitive.\"\n\nIn a press release at that time, the FTC stated the proposed deal will \"eliminate fierce competition\" between the two brands, which would lead to \"higher prices for groceries and other essential household items for millions of Americans.\"\n\nIn addition, the FTC's statement cites the thousands of grocery store workers who would be affected and how the merger would \"immediately erase aggressive competition for workers, threatening the ability of employees to secure higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kroger and Albertsons said earlier this year, their own future is at risk if they don't combine forces in order to compete in the changing retail landscape.\n\nAdditional Kroger coverage: Grocery store chain to pay nearly $50M to Washington to combat fentanyl crisis\n\n\"Blocking this merger would only serve to strengthen larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco, and Amazon by allowing them to maintain and increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry,\" a statement reads.\n\nAs Reuters noted in its previous coverage, U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson in Portland, Oregon, will preside over a hearing on the FTC's bid for a preliminary injunction to block the merger on Aug. 26.\n\nOnce again PDF of the full list of stores impacted in Washington and across the U.S. by the Kroger announcement can be viewed here.

Kroger owns Harris Teeter and Albertsons owns Safeway, but no Safeway stores in the D.C. region were on the divestiture list, which includes almost 580 stores in 19 states.\n\nShould the merger be approved, C&S Wholesale Grocers, the parent company of the Piggly Wiggly grocery store chain, has agreed to acquire the divested stores.\n\nAll three stores have said no stores would be closed as a result of the merger, no jobs would be cut and all collective bargaining agreements would be honored.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which opposes the merger, issued a statement.\n\n\"Today's announcement changes nothing. The merger is not a done deal, far from it,\" the statement said. \"We remain focused on stopping the proposed megamerger for the same reasons we have stated since it was announced 20 months ago.\"\n\nUFCW locals contend the merger would harm workers, shoppers, suppliers and communities.\n\nCombined, Kroger and Albertsons operate more than 5,000 stores, under their namesakes and others including Ralphs, Acme and Jewel-Osco. Albertsons also owns Balducci's Food Lovers Market.\n\nIn addition to Piggly Wiggly, C&S Wholesale operates the Grand Union supermarket chain, wholesale operations and owns private-label store brands.\n\nA Federal Trade Commission complaint aimed at blocking the deal alleges it would harm consumers by eliminating competition of prices and quality, and give the companies increased leverage of employee wages and benefits.

The two chains originally announced plans to merge in October 2022, but that's been put on hold after the FTC sued to block the $24.6 billion merger from happening. Before the lawsuit, the FTC said selling 400 stores to another company, C&S Wholesale Grocers, was \"inadequate.\" Kroger and Albertsons went back to the drawing board and upped the number of stores they would sell to C&S to 579.\n\nREAD MORE: One of the Cheapest Grocery Stores in America Has 13 Locations in Idaho\n\nThat new plan actually lowered the number of Albertsons stores that the companies planned to part with in Idaho from 13 to 10. While that seemed like a bit of good news for the state where Albertsons was born, Idahoans were still left guessing which stores would rebrand in the sale.\n\nThat's no longer a mystery. Ohio-based Kroger, Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers recently uploaded a document revealing the addresses of all of the stores and distribution centers that would change hands if the merger does eventually come to pass.\n\nHere's a look at the number of stores impacted by the merger in our region:\n\nBased on these numbers, it really does appear that Kroger benefits more than Albertsons in Idaho and its neighboring states. 73% of the stores getting spun off in the four states listed are brands under the Albertsons umbrella. Only the QFC stores belong to Kroger. Ultimately, they decided to keep all of their Fred Meyer branded stores in Idaho.\n\nAgain, we say this will happen if the merger goes through. It's not a done deal. C&S could end up with these 10 Idaho locations. The company already has a presence in the Northwest in the form of a warehouse located in Troutdale, Oregon located about 20 miles from Portland.\n\nTheir brands include Grand Union, Southern Family Markets, Piggly Wiggly, Nell's and Olean Wholesale Grocery. They would likely rebrand these stores in a manner similar to how Albertsons rebranded and remodeled the Paul's Market locations in McCall and on Lake Hazel in Boise when they acquired the smaller company in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "kidotalkradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIDO Talk Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_heart@kidotalkradio.com", "name": "Michelle Heart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C&S_Wholesale_Grocers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C&S Wholesale Grocers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olean_Wholesale_Grocery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olean Wholesale Grocery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_(supermarket)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Union (supermarket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QFC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggly_Wiggly", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piggly Wiggly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Meyer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troutdale,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troutdale, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troutdale, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/660/files/2024/02/attachment-attachment-GettyImages-1408955685.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720065", "eventUri": "eng-9720065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

C&S has committed to transferring pay and health plans and assuming all collective bargaining agreements, he added.\n\nThe grocers, which announced their $25 billion merger in October 2022, are sharing the list ahead of a trial expected in August that will decide the outcome of their deal.\n\nKroger and Albertsons agreed to sell a package of stores and other facilities to C&S, boosting the number to 579 from 413 in April after the Federal Trade Commission blocked the tie-up. The divestment sale was valued at $2.9 billion in April.\n\nThe list also includes 124 stores in Washington state, 101 in Arizona and 91 in Colorado, among others. Most of the California stores are in Southern California.\n\nThe divestment package also includes a dairy plant in Colorado, as well as six distribution centers across four states.\n\nTogether, Kroger and Albertsons have nearly 5,000 stores across the country, including banners like Kroger, Ralphs, and Harris Teeter as well as Albertsons, Safeway, Acme and Jewel-Osco.\n\nKroger and Albertsons say they need the merger to compete with larger, non-unionized rivals Amazon.com, Walmart and Costco. The companies have pledged to invest $500 million to cut prices and $1 billion to raise worker wages and benefits, in addition to $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores.\n\nThe FTC's complaint alleges the deal would harm consumers by eliminating competition on prices and quality, making the combined firm less likely to improve its services by offering flexible hours and pickup services. It also would give the grocers increased leverage over workers, slowing wage growth and worsening benefits, according to the complaint.\n\nUnion workers in California also are protesting the planned merger, saying their jobs could be in jeopardy in any divestiture.\n\nThe FTC has also alleged that C&S would face significant challenges stitching together the various stores acquired from the grocers, and deems the grocers' proposed divestiture package inadequate. In 2015, the agency allowed Albertsons to buy Safeway after it sold 168 stores, the bulk of them to Washington state grocer Haggen Holdings LLC. Less than a year later, Haggen filed for bankruptcy and Albertsons bought back a number of the stores.\n\nThe list of stores to be sold to C&S includes dozens of locations that Albertsons reacquired, including 12 Haggen stores in Washington.\n\nThe Haggen brand will spark the many memories among Southern California shoppers, who saw 70 grocery stores in the region convert to the Pacific Northwest banner nine years ago.\n\nThe grocer bought 146 stores in the Albertsons-Safeway divestiture in 2015.\n\nHaggen's concept, which touted itself as Albertsons meets Whole Foods, didn't take with shoppers who complained of high prices. The banner would be gone in just six months.\n\nThe vacant properties left behind in Haggen's exit languished for years, only recently updating to new names such as Rivera Food Service or familiar chains like Gelson's and 99 Ranch Market.\n\nHere is the list of California stores that Kroger and Albertsons said would be sold to C&S Wholesale:\n\nOne lone Safeway at 1499 Washington Ave. in the

However, company officials released information showing the merger would instead bolster their company and allow it to better compete with the previously mentioned competition.\n\nBy agreeing to sell 579 more stores nationwide, including 124 in WA, merger officials hope it will now be approved swiftly by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nA list of the stores has been released, and the majority are in Western WA. The sales include Haggen, Kroger, QFC, Safeway, and Albertsons locations. Notably, all five QFC stores in Bellevue will be sold.\n\nThe Spokane Valley and South Hill Safeway stores in Spokane are on the list, and the Yakima Safeway at 5702 Summitview Ave. will be sold. The Safeway in Wenatchee will also be sold off.\n\nThis sale does not affect Fred Meyer, and no other stores are being sold in in Eastern WA.", "source": {"uri": "610kona.com", "dataType": "news",

A store just across the county line in Agoura Hills is also listed for divestiture.\n\nIf the merger goes through, the company will have about 5,000 stores, 15% of market share, and 700,000 employees

We applaud their actions. They have been in possession of this proposed divestiture list, made public today by the companies, for months and that did not change their opposition to the proposed merger.\"\n\nIt has remained unclear if the revised plan would satisfy regulators. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission in February sued to block the $24.6 billion merger between the grocery giants, saying the lack of competition would lead to higher grocery prices and lower wages for workers.\n\nColorado Attorney General announces lawsuit to block Kroger, Albertsons merger\n\nKroger's attempt to merge with Albertsons Companies Inc., also hit a snag in Colorado in February when Attorney General Phil Weiser announced a lawsuit to block the supermarket chains from combining.\n\nWeiser said themerger of the parent companies of King Soopers/City Market and Safeway would kill competition and hurt consumers.\n\n\"Coloradans are concerned about undue consolidation and its harmful impacts on consumers, workers, and suppliers,\" said Weiser in a news release. \"After 19 town halls across the state, I am convinced that Coloradans think this merger between the two supermarket chains would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.\"\n\nA total of eight states have challenged the merger.

Both chains are the parent companies of prominent California brands: Safeway, Vons and Pavilions belonging to Albertsons, while Kroger owns Ralphs and Food 4 Less.\n\nIf approved, the new combined business would own almost 5,000 stores, thousands of pharmacies and fuel centers, and dozens of distribution centers and plants, according to Patch.\n\nWhile union leaders and regulators criticized and attempted to block the move, such as when the FTC sued to halt the acquisition in February, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen alleged the move would save as much as $1 billion and lead to lower prices and higher wages.\n\nUnder the deal, Golden State locations would be sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers, according to Patch.\n\nThe Pali storefront would be one of more than 60 California locations offloaded by the companies, and among several in L.A. County such as those in Malibu, Culver City, Beverly Hills, Huntington Beach, Marina del Rey and West Hollywood.\n\nIn its suit, the FTC asserts that the deal would lead to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items, reduce competition which would lower the quality of products while narrowing consumers' choices for where to shop, and erase competition among workers.\n\n\"This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,\" said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, in a news release. \"Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.\"\n\nThat suit is scheduled for trial at the end of August, according to Patch.\n\nFor a full list of the two chains' stores and distribution centers

Specifically, how much they're spending on groceries.\n\nA pending $25 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons -- two of the country's largest grocery chains -- would also drastically affect how Americans get their groceries. Combined, the company would be the second-largest grocery chain in the country, trailing only Walmart.\n\nIn October 2022, when the two companies announced their intent to merge, it immediately raised a red flag for members of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, consumer rights organizations, and labor activists.\n\nTheir respective CEOs eventually testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The FTC stepped in, and a bipartisan group of attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the merger. Opponents argue that the merger could hinder grocery buyers' choices, eliminate competition, and lead to lower-quality products for consumers.\n\nShoppers like Victoria Anderson are all too familiar with the lack of competition.\n\nIn rural Vermont, Anderson goes to Shaw's, owned by Albertsons. There's essentially no competition around her, so there's little incentive for the market to lower prices to something she and her family feel is reasonable.\n\n\"It's like grocery prices skyrocketed one day, and then it feels like they just really have not leveled out. Initially they were saying, Oh, it's a shortage of goods and we can't get anything over here because of the shipping and COVID. And it's like, OK, well it's 2024,\" Anderson told Slate.\n\nThat's despite economic measures that otherwise suggest that prices should be down in the grocery aisle. Over the past two years, inflation has cooled 5.8 percent. The costs of goods like eggs and milk have also dropped.\n\nThe Biden administration has continually touted the slowing of inflation as an economic success heading into the general election. But many consumers, including Anderson, are not feeling the benefits of the stronger economy the White House keeps invoking -- a trend that emboldens conservative messaging rather than points the finger at corporate markups, which accounted for half of inflation in 2021.\n\n\"When you have such a big place in the market, you also have the opportunity to hide behind shocks like inflation or like a pandemic,\" said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist for the public policy think tank Groundwork Collaborative. \"That's when you see profiteering behavior go up and up and up. This is especially the case for companies in sectors where they have a captive market,\" such as megagrocers.\n\nIn 2023 corporate profits hit their widest margins since the 1950s, and yet prices continued to rise for consumers at the grocery store.\n\n\"Businesses are profit maximizers. If companies could have raised prices before then, they would have,\" said William Dickens, professor of economics and public policy at Northeastern University.\n\nThis February, a group of Democratic senators led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act. In addition to outlawing price gouging, the legislation would call on the FTC to target companies that allegedly exploited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to increase profits. The bill would also provide $1 billion to the federal agency.\n\nIf the bill passes, its enforcement will depend on who's sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has previously weaponized the FTC. He tried to block the AT&T and Time Warner merger, a move critics believe he made because he didn't like the way CNN, then a subsidiary of Time Warner, was covering his presidency.\n\nEven in instances not involving a personal feud, Trump has been tough on several other big mergers and acquisitions. The Trump administration blocked a merger between Sinclair Broadcasting and Tribune Media, as well as between Broadcom and Qualcomm; and forced companies like DaVita, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and CVS to make significant concessions to push a merger through.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has vowed to be a little more lax with those he considers friendly to his interests, like the oil and gas sector. In the case of Kroger and Albertsons, the CEO of the private-equity firm that is Albertsons' largest shareholder is Steve Feinberg, who also happens to be one of Trump's closest allies.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder Biden, the FTC has been pretty hawkish on mergers. The Biden White House blocked mergers in the airline industry and within hospital systems. In the process, the administration updated antitrust guidelines that would allow the agency to keep a closer eye on ultra-consolidated industries like grocery stores.\n\n\"Elements of the Biden guidelines all point in the direction of tougher merger control of more, critical scrutiny of mergers,\" said William Kovacic, director of the Competition Law Center at the George Washington University, who also served as FTC commissioner under the Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nIf the Kroger-Albertsons merger goes through, higher prices due to a lack of competition could be an issue for not just rural Americans but those in some of the country's biggest urban centers. A Kroger spokesperson, pushing back, said: \"The merger will also mean lower prices and more choices for fresh food for customers and more investments in our communities.\"\n\nHistorically, however, that has not been the case with mergers. And further consolidation would mean major repercussions for the people who work for these stores too. In Denver, Albertsons and Kroger alone control 44 percent of the market share. In Chicago, they control 25 percent; in Seattle, almost 36 percent. The grocery business is already so concentrated that employment options would otherwise be limited.\n\n\"The case emphasizes the impact on organized labor and on workers in a variety of settings. A major concern of the FTC and looking at the transaction is that the merger will diminish competition for the laborers who work in these stores,\" Kovacic said.\n\nFor its part, Kroger said it is \"committed to protecting good-paying union jobs\" as part of this merger. In a statement, a spokesperson told Slate: \"Kroger's merger with Albertsons will mean workers gain from $1 billion in higher wages, expanded benefits, long-term job security, and a strong unionized workforce.\"\n\nKroger's promises would be a major shift from the chain's current reputation and from what independent experts suggest.\n\nIn 2022 the Colorado attorney general filed a lawsuit against the two companies, asserting that they had allegedly \"colluded to suppress the wages and benefits of their workers\" amid a grocery worker strike at 78 locations of the Kroger-owned King Sooper stores. According to the suit, Albertsons agreed not to hire any striking Kroger employees.\n\nJust last month, thousands of workers voted to authorize a strike over wage and hour disputes at the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less. And a report from the Economic Roundtable found that 14 percent of Kroger workers are experiencing or have experienced homelessness in the past year. The Economic Policy Institute says that the merger could result in $334 million in lost wages, affecting roughly 746,000 workers.\n\n\"A merger like this is likely to erode real wages,\" Dickens, the Northeastern professor, told Slate.\n\nKroger's spokesperson said, \"If the merger is blocked, the non-union retailers like Walmart and Amazon will become even more powerful and unaccountable.\"\n\nBoth Walmart and Amazon have been accused of union busting over the years. Some Amazon workers have successfully been able to unionize.\n\nIn order to assuage the FTC's monopoly concerns, Kroger and Albertsons made efforts to scrap some locations in their portfolio, divesting from 579 stores to C&S Wholesale, but that might not be enough.\n\n\"There's some controversy as to whether the divestiture and the new buyer are equipped even to compete directly with Kroger postmerger,\" said Felix Chang, a law professor and co-director of the Corporate Law Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. \"The divest itself might not even be sufficient.\"\n\nIt's much like when Albertsons acquired Safeway stores, added Chang. In order for the merger to go through, Albertsons divested from 168 stores -- 146 went to Haggen, a mom-and-pop grocery chain based in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe deal looked great for Haggen's majority shareholder at the time, the private-equity firm Comvest. The 2014 Haggen deal expanded its footprint with a chance to become a national power player in a grocery sector that was otherwise consolidating.\n\nLess than a year after Haggen paid roughly $1.4 billion for the stores, the company filed for bankruptcy and sued Albertsons for $1 billion, alleging that the chain had taken part in \"coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition and Haggen as a viable competitor.\" Albertsons settled the lawsuit for only $5.7 million. And after all was said and done, Albertsons got some of those stores back.\n\nIn the end, no matter the industry, only big names are able to compete -- they can lower prices and eat up some lost revenue, while the little guys just cannot. But, Chang said, \"if they're too consolidated, they are more vulnerable to shocks to the supply chains,\" such as a massive recall or an avian flu outbreak.\n\nThe concerns among regulators and the long-term fights between Washington and the C-suite could take years. That doesn't change the reality for consumers like Anderson, who buy groceries every week. Cost-of-living issues have always been a major concern for voters, and knowing that their president isn't going to support making their groceries more expensive could heavily sway their vote.",

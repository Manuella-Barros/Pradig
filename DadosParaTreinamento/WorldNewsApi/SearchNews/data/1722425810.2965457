A statement on Friday by the Head, Corporate Communications of EEDC, Emeka Ezeh, said the incident happened in the early hours of Friday. Ezeh, who described the incident as \u201ctragic and very unfortunate,\u201d lamented the increasing rate at which vandals attack electricity installations within the EEDC\u2019s network daily. Ezeh said, \u201cIn the early hours of today (Friday), the lifeless body of a yet-to-be-identified vandal suspect was found within the space of a distribution transformer belonging to the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company Plc located around Missionary Avenue, Coal Camp, Enugu. \u201cFrom all indications, it is presumed that the power supply must have been restored while the deceased was cutting the armoured cables, which resulted in him being electrocuted. \u201cVandalism has been a big challenge to the company, and there is no way this can be addressed without the support of critical stakeholders.\u201d Ezeh lamented the increasing rate at which criminals plunder electricity installations within EEDC\u2019s network daily, noting that it has adversely impacted not just the quality of service to its customers but also its revenue. Meanwhile, the organisation in a statement on Friday, said, \u201cThe attention of the EEDC has been drawn to a video circulating on the social media space, made by one Mazi Okechukwu Cyril Nwuche who claims to be a lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, and the Anambra State Chairman of South East Electricity Consumers Association, purporting that EEDC is calling on its customers to apply for a free prepaid metre. \u201cThis information is not only incorrect but laced with mischief aimed at misleading unsuspecting customers and creating confusion within the space. \u201cWhilst EEDC encourages its customers in need of meters to apply and have their premises metered, it is important that they are armed with the right information, and that they also understand the procedure in place for metre acquisition.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A yet-to-be-identified suspected electricity vandal has been electrocuted while attempting to steal transformer cable which belong to the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company.

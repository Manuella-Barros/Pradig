Wish You Were Here NETHERLANDS: This spring, San Jose Middle School student Blaze Bentz took an 18-day tour of London, Amsterdam and Berlin accompanied by her grandmother, San Jose resident Polly Ferguson, and her aunt, Abby Lineberry. \u201cWe went to the wrong museum!\u201d says Polly. \u201cAfter an emotional visit to the exceptionally well done Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the plan was to have a Dutch pancake and then go to the Resistance Museum, but due to a lack of meticulous advance planning and unfamiliarity with the language, we ended up at the Rijksmuseum! \u201cThe Rijksmuseum is an impressive museum. We saw a lot of Rembrandts, Van Gohgs and Vermeers, which is not a bad thing, but we wanted to go to the \u2014 we now know \u2014 Verzetsmuseum focused on the Dutch resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II. TRAVEL TIPS: \u201cBook the Anne Frank House in advance! Tickets go on sale six weeks out and sell out within hours. Abby was up at 2 a.m. six weeks before the trip, with her finger on the \u2018buy\u2019 button to ensure we had tickets. The Pancake Club serves delicious pancakes/crepes with outdoor seating overlooking a canal. Tickets for the Rijksmuseum can be bought in advance or at the door, but tickets at the door are time stamped and you might have to wait an hour or more before entering the museum. Tickets to the much smaller and much less famous Verzetsmuseum can be purchased at the door for immediate entry.\u201d Join the fun!

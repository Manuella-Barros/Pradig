{"id": 231285434, "title": "Poll-topper Welby is first past the post", "text": "The first count of the Connemara North poll has seen Oughterard\u2019s Thomas Welby romp home for the first seat with over 1,700 first preferences in the first result announced for Galway. This is the fourth time the garage owner has topped the poll, previously taking first place in 2009, 2014 and 2019. His transfers are likely to benefit fellow Oughterard candidate Seamus Walsh, who ran for Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice\u2019s party, Independent Ireland, after falling out spectacularly with Fianna F\u00e1il over his stance on the arson attack at the Ross Lake Hotel in Rosscahill before it was to be used as accommodation for international protection applicants. Cllr Walsh got 1,525 first preferences and will likely be elected on the second count. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s sitting councillors in Clifden, Eileen Mannion and Gerry King, a fish farmer from Errislannan, are both expected to keep their seats this four-seater, with counting expected to conclude by this evening. Cllr King came marginally ahead of Cllr Mannion with 1,435 first preferences, ten more than his colleague.

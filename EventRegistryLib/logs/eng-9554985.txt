(Nasdaq: ASMB), a biotechnology company developing innovative therapeutics targeting serious viral diseases, today reported financial results and recent highlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\"We are pleased that we now have regulatory clearance to initiate trials evaluating our promising investigational therapies ABI-5366 and ABI-4334 and look forward to sharing interim data from these studies later this year,\" said Jason Okazaki, chief executive officer and president of Assembly Bio. \"These clearances are a significant step toward our goal of reaching key clinical inflection points for multiple programs in our antiviral pipeline by year end. Our continued clinical progress reflects the strength and agility of our highly experienced team and our singular focus of improving treatment options for those living with serious viral diseases.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights\n\nTwo clinical trial applications received clearance to proceed:ABI-5366, a long-acting herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase inhibitor candidate, for initiation of Phase 1a/1b clinical studies in both healthy volunteers and in individuals with recurrent genital herpesABI-4334, a next-generation, highly potent capsid assembly modulator candidate, for initiation of a Phase 1b study in individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infectionAn abstract highlighting preclinical data for ABI-6250, an oral, small molecule HBV/hepatitis delta virus (HDV) entry inhibitor candidate, has been accepted for poster presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) CongressTM 2024, June 5-8, 2024\n\nAnticipated 2024 Milestones\n\nABI-5366 and ABI-4334 studies expected to initiate by mid-2024:ABI-5366 Phase 1a interim clinical data expected in Q3 2024 and interim Phase 1b data expected in the first half of 2025ABI-4334 Phase 1b interim clinical data expected by the end of 2024Two additional candidates are anticipated to enter the clinic by the end of 2024:ABI-1179, a long-acting HSV helicase-primase inhibitor contributed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) under the collaboration between Assembly Bio and GileadABI-6250, a small molecule orally-bioavailable HDV entry inhibitor\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $113.0 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $130.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Assembly Bio's cash position is projected to fund operations into the second half of 2025.Revenues from collaborative research were $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. There was no revenue recognized for the same period in 2023. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 consists of amounts recognized under the collaboration with Gilead.Research and development expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $14.5 million for the same period in 2023. Increased expenses related to the development of ABI-1179 and ABI-6250 were more than offset by savings from the discontinuation of ABI-H3733 and vebicorvir as well as reduced employee and contractor-related expenses.General and administrative expenses were $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $9.1 million, or $1.66 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $19.0 million, or $4.46 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe investigational products and investigational product candidates referenced here have not been approved anywhere globally, and their safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\nAbout Assembly Biosciences\n\nAssembly Biosciences is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of innovative small-molecule therapeutics designed to change the path of serious viral diseases and improve the lives of patients worldwide.

(Nasdaq: KRON), a company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and other diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today reported recent business progress and financial results for the first-quarter of 2024.\n\nWe have continued to make good progress towards our goals. We are looking forward to sharing a clinical update on the KB-0742 data to date at ASCO in June, said Nobert Bischofberger, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Kronos Bio, Inc. We expect to complete the IND-enabling studies for KB-9558 by the end of 2024 and expect to dose our first patients in the first half of 2025. Our collaboration with Genentech and our internal discovery programs continue to advance and we look forward to sharing our progress later this year.\n\nKronos Bio, Inc (Nasdaq: KRON) is a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address deregulated transcription, a hallmark of cancer and other diseases. Our proprietary discovery engine decodes complex transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks to identify druggable cofactors. We screen for and optimize small molecules that target these cofactors in a tumor-specific context. These efforts have yielded a preclinical pipeline along with two internally developed drug candidates. KB-0742 targets CDK9 to address MYC deregulation in solid tumors and KB-9558 targets p300 to address IRF4 dependence in multiple myeloma.\n\nKronos Bio is based in San Mateo, Calif., and has a research facility in Cambridge, Mass.

The press release, in some cases, uses terms such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, plan, will, or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding Kronos Bio's intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things, the next clinical update on KB-0742; our expected completion of IND-enabling studies and the timing thereof for KB-9558; our expected clinical trial for KB-9558 and the timeline for dosing the first patients; future pipeline development activities or outcomes; the potential of Kronos Bio's product candidates; Kronos Bio's expected cash runway; and other statements that are not historical fact. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: risks associated with changes to the assumptions underlying estimated expenses and savings; changes in the macroeconomic environment or competitive landscape that impact Kronos Bio's business; risks associated with completing necessary preclinical studies and receiving regulatory clearance for, and enrolling, clinical trials; whether Kronos Bio will be able to progress its clinical trials on the timelines anticipated, including due to risks inherent in the clinical development of novel therapeutics; risks related to Kronos Bio's limited experience as a company in conducting clinical trials; the risk that results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials (including preliminary results) are not necessarily predictive of future results; and risks associated with the sufficiency of Kronos Bio's cash resources and need for additional capital.

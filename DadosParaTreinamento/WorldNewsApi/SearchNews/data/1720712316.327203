{"id": 231982202, "title": "Shots Fired: For those who have lost loved ones to gunfire, the suffering sometimes doesn&#8217;t end", "text": "\u201cIf I never have to plan another funeral, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Ebony Selby sighed as she sat under a gazebo in the Manteo, North Carolina, neighborhood where she and her large, extended family have lived for decades. On the table in front of her were pictures of four beloved family members. Each had been fatally shot over the past couple of years. The youngest was a niece. She was just 3 when she was shot in the back seat of her mother\u2019s car. The others were Selby\u2019s brother and sister, and another niece who\u2019d just turned 18. Selby saw two of them as they lay dead and bloodied on the ground, leaving her with memories that will haunt her for the rest of her life. And while it may be difficult to fathom having even one loved one gunned down, Selby is far from alone in having more than one relative who\u2019s been shot. Numerous families in the Hampton Roads and northeastern North Carolina region have suffered that same fate. Why some families are touched by violence more than others \u201cis not really explainable,\u201d said Alan Wolfelt, director of the Colorado-based Center for Loss and Life Transition and the author of dozens of books about grief and death. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d Wolfelt said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like how some families go for years without any deaths, and then there are some families that seem to have one death right after another.\u201d Living in areas where homicides are more frequent likely is a factor for some, he said. \u201cIt could be where you live, it could be putting yourself in vulnerable situations that put you at greater risk,\u201d Wolfelt said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d The grief that results from a loved one\u2019s murder can be much more difficult to deal with than other types of losses, according to counselor Deuene Hickman, founder of the Quality of Life Counseling Center in Hampton. He\u2019s assisted many people who\u2019ve lost family members to gunfire. In addition to the sudden shock, there\u2019s the knowledge that the victim suffered a violent and senseless death, Hickman said. If the crime isn\u2019t solved, their grief is only compounded. And even if it is solved, navigating the criminal justice system \u2014 and all the delays, uncertainty and disappointments that often come with it \u2014 can be trying, Hickman said. For Selby, a 43-year-old single mother of three, the grief is unbearable at times. So is the anxiety. \u201cI never knew anxiety before all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cAny moment now I could have a panic attack. I had never had a panic attack before in my life.\u201d Norfolk\u2019s Bilal Muhammad and Chesapeake\u2019s Monica Atkins understand. Muhammad has lost two close relatives to shootings; Atkins three. Both later turned that grief into activism and now lead local anti-gun violence groups in Hampton Roads. For Muhammad, the first loss came in 1982, when his brother Ruben was killed in Portsmouth. Muhammad, 67, was in his 20s at the time. His brother \u2014 a heroin addict who began dealing to support his habit \u2014 was 32. \u201cThey dropped his body at a construction site, and a construction worker found him the next day,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cI was devastated. My mother \u2014 she about had a nervous breakdown.\u201d A man was eventually arrested and charged, but he was acquitted, leaving no one to be held accountable, Muhammad said. Last summer, Muhammad\u2019s youngest child, Ali Muhammad, was fatally shot in Norfolk\u2019s Ocean View area. Muhammad said Ali, 33, was on his way to work, and the two were talking on the phone when he heard Ali tell someone to \u201cget that gun out of my face.\u201d Next, he heard a gunshot. Muhammad called 911, and he and his wife, Cynthia, rushed over. The couple had just celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary the day before. Ali, a father of three young girls, was dead when they got there. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cHe was such a good man. He was a family man. He loved his daughters so much.\u201d About a month later, 28-year-old Jalen Garces was charged with murdering Ali. Video footage obtained by investigators placed him in the area, according to police. Muhammad believes Garces was acting on behalf of someone who was in a dispute with his son, but no one else has been charged. Moving on without Ali has been difficult, Muhammad said. \u201cI still break down every once in a while, but they hold me up,\u201d he said, referring to Ali\u2019s daughters, now 3, 7 and 9. Muhammad and his wife have been helping Ali\u2019s girlfriend care for the girls. \u201cThey are what keeps us going,\u201d he said. Muhammad said he was already active in community events and causes when his brother died, but began to focus on gun violence afterwards. His resolve only grew stronger after Ali\u2019s slaying. \u201cIf he were alive today, he\u2019d be right here beside me,\u201d Muhammad said while leading an anti-gun violence march and social event in Chesapeake\u2019s Peaceful Village in March. Atkins\u2019 activism began after her cousin Aron Turner was killed in 2013. Atkins said Turner was sleeping on a couch in a home in Portsmouth when someone attempting a burglary began firing into the house. The case remains unsolved. \u201cIn 2013, (the gun violence problem) was nothing like it is now,\u201d said Atkins, 51. \u201cI never thought it would happen to me again.\u201d But it did the following year. Her son, Antonio Atkins, 25, was shot and killed while driving in Portsmouth. His girlfriend was wounded but Atkins\u2019 other son, who was in the back seat, wasn\u2019t harmed. \u201cFrom that moment on, my life changed,\u201d she said. Atkins said police didn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to charge anyone but she believes she knows who was responsible, and that person is in prison now for another violent offense. Tragedy next struck last September, when Atkin\u2019s 31-year-old niece, Erica Atkins, was fatally shot on a street corner in Portsmouth. Two other women were injured. A 17-year-old boy was later charged. Atkins believes it was an accident and that the teen started shooting because he heard shots and thought he was under fire. She believes her niece, a mother of two, was caught in the crossfire. Working to prevent further violence and educate others about it has been therapeutic, she said. \u201cMy son wouldn\u2019t want me to just sit around and mope all day long,\u201d she said. \u201cStress can kill you. So can a broken heart.\u201d Antonio\u2019s father died just six months after his son was killed. He already was in poor health, Atkins said, but Antonio\u2019s death made it worse. Atkins said counseling has helped tremendously in battling her grief. It\u2019s essential for people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to violence, Hickman said, yet many never seek it. \u201cSome people live in fear, some are able to move on and do okay, and some are unable to function afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they all lose a portion of themselves. Without counseling, I\u2019m not sure they can get that back.\u201d Often when a person loses a loved one to violence, they blame themselves, Hickman said, especially in cases where they\u2019re the parent of the deceased. They may ask themselves things such as, \u201cWhat if we lived in a better neighborhood? What if I hadn\u2019t let my son go out that night?\u201d Anger is another major issue for many, Hickman said \u2014 anger at the killer, and anger at police and prosecutors if they feel their case isn\u2019t being handled properly. Therapists can guide them in dealing with heightened emotions, he said, and also connect them with support groups, and victim assistance agencies that can aid with expenses such as funeral and counseling costs. ___ Ebony Selby\u2019s nightmare The first loss for Selby came in December 2021, when her sister, Takeyia Berry, 39, and Berry\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, Allura Pledger, were fatally shot. Roderick White \u2014 a man Berry had known for years \u2014 had asked her to drive him to Elizabeth City, Selby said. Berry agreed and took her young daughter along. On the way, they picked up Jaquan White, an 18-year-old relative of White\u2019s. After they arrived in Elizabeth City, someone fired on the car. White was the only occupant who survived \u2014 but not for long. He was killed in another shooting nearly a year later. Selby said she\u2019d last talked to her sister the night before she was killed. Both single moms, the two were very close, she said, and helped raise each other\u2019s children. Berry had another daughter who was 16 at the time. Selby took her in. \u201cWe\u2019re a family full of laughs, and she was really funny,\u201d Selby said of her sister. \u201cShe loved her daughters so much. She was very serious about schooling with her oldest daughter, who made As and Bs all the time.\u201d The day of the shooting, Selby\u2019s phone started lighting up with calls and texts. She was told Berry was already gone, but Allura had a chance. Soon after, she got a call saying Allura had died. The days and weeks that followed were a blur, Selby said. Just getting out of bed was a struggle some days. Selby believes White was the target and that he used Berry and Allura as shields, thinking he wouldn\u2019t get fired at if he had a woman and child with him. Two men were later charged with the murders and are awaiting trial. One, Ricky Etheridge Jr., faces a possible death sentence if convicted. The next loss came a little more than a year later, when Selby\u2019s niece, Aonesty Selby, was killed. Aonesty was the daughter of Selby\u2019s brother Demetrius Selby, who would become the family\u2019s next shooting victim later that same year. Selby was with Aonesty\u2019s parents when they found her body on a remote logging trail in Isle of Wight County on Jan. 13, 2023. It was three days after Aonesty\u2019s 18th birthday, and two days after detectives believe the Williamsburg high school senior was killed. Aonesty\u2019s family called police after they were unable to reach her, and also sought help through social media. A friend told them Aonesty had shared a cellphone ping to her location. The family told police, then headed there themselves, Selby said. The area is home to a hunting club and was gated, forcing them to go on foot, she said. It was pitch black so they turned on their cellphone flashlights. After about two miles of walking along the cold, muddy trail, Aonesty\u2019s mother let out a scream Selby said she\u2019ll never forget. \u201cShe (Aonesty) was laying there like she had been perfectly placed,\u201d Selby said. \u201cHer hair, her makeup, her nails, they were all perfectly done, just like they always were.\u201d A friend of Aonesty\u2019s, Andarius Tyshone McClelland, 21, was charged with her murder days later. Reports indicated the two had been in a relationship, but Selby said that wasn\u2019t true. Selby was haunted by the ordeal. She avoided going out, especially at night. Her children, now 17, 18, and 20, missed the mom she used to be, she said, a carefree person who always went to their football games and band concerts. \u201cThey also lost them (the murdered relatives), but they lost me, too,\u201d she said. \u201cMy anxiety wouldn\u2019t let me go out and be in public. I didn\u2019t want to have to talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to see that look of pity.\u201d Last summer, Selby lost her job handling medical records at a nursing facility. She felt too anxious to look for another job, and hasn\u2019t worked since. Then last October, her brother was shot and killed by a sheriff\u2019s deputy outside a friend\u2019s trailer home in Manteo. The deputy \u2014 who said Demetrius Selby was coming at him with a knife \u2014 was later cleared of wrongdoing. Selby lives a short distance from where it happened. She hurried over after seeing sheriff\u2019s vehicles racing past. Deputies wouldn\u2019t let her near the scene at first, but she eventually was allowed in and stayed with Demetrius\u2019 bloodied body until it was taken away several hours later. Demetrius\u2019 surviving daughters filed a lawsuit against the deputy, claiming the shooting was unjustified. Selby has seen bodycam video of the incident and believes it wasn\u2019t justified. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m afraid to have hope. I\u2019m just constantly scared for all my kids and my nieces,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather them be at home with me, but then I feel bad because I\u2019m like they don\u2019t need to be stuck in the house with me all the time.\u201d As for the future, Selby said she\u2019s considering a move to Maryland to be near a cousin. She\u2019s lived in North Carolina all her life, but believes a new environment will be good for her. She also plans to look for a job, and may finally get the counseling she knows she needs. Selby said she tries to focus only on the good memories she has of her lost relatives \u2014 and fights to keep the images of them lying dead on the ground, or in their caskets, out of her mind. And while she\u2019s fearful for herself and the rest of her family, she doesn\u2019t own a firearm. \u201cI don\u2019t like guns,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one, and I never will.\u201d Jane Harper, jane.harper@pilotonline.com", "summary": "Losing even one family member to a fatal shooting is devastating, but for some families in the Hampton Roads and northeastern North Carolina region, that tragic fate has happened multiple times.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/06/09/shots-fired-for-those-who-have-lost-loved-ones-to-gunfire-the-suffering-sometimes-doesnt-end/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TVP-L-NW-MULTIPLE-MURDERS-0609-SMK-003.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:38:40", "author": "Jane Harper", "authors": ["Jane Harper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.021}

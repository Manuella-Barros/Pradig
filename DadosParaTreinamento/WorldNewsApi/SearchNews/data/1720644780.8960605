But that does not mean that it will not stake claim in the future. Right now, we have taken a wait-and-watch stand. The country needs change. \u201cThe NDA will now have to accommodate so many partners. I think the INDIA bloc will form the government in the near future. Till then, this government can continue,\u201d the Trinamool Congress supremo told mediapersons after meeting the newly-elected MPs of the party. Explaining why she feels that the INDIA bloc can be in a position to form the government at the Centre, the Chief Minister said, \u201cThe allies in the NDA have too many demands. Whereas the allies in the INDIA bloc do not have any demand.\u201d According to Banerjee, after the \u2018poor show\u2019 in the Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi should have left his chair for someone else. \u201cI said the NDA will not cross the 200 mark. However, the gain in numbers for the NDA was helped by the Election Commission of India,\u201d the Chief Minister claimed. During the meeting with the newly-elected MPs, the Chief Minister outlined the roadmap for Trinamool on the floor of the 18th Lok Sabha. The three issues that the party MPs will be vocal about will be the non-release of central funds to the state, misuse of central agencies against the opposition parties, and opposing the CAA and NRC. The Chief Minister also claimed that Trinamool\u2019s tally in the Lok Sabha polls would have gone beyond the 29 seats it won if not for the \u2018manipulations\u2019 by the polling officials on certain seats. \u201cThe results in both the constituencies in East Midnapore \u2014 Kanthi and Tamluk \u2014 were manipulated,\u201d she claimed. \u2013IANS src/arm", "summary": "<p>Kolkata, June 8 (IANS) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed on Saturday that the opposition INDIA bloc might stake claim to form the government at the Centre in the&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/nda-allies-have-too-many-demands-mamata-banerjee-hints-at-india-bloc-forming-govt-in-near-future/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8216;NDA allies have too many demands&#8217;, Mamata Banerjee hints at INDIA bloc forming govt in near future</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/nda-allies-have-too-many-demands-mamata-banerjee-hints-at-india-bloc-forming-govt-in-near-future/\">\u2018NDA allies have too many demands\u2019, Mamata Banerjee hints at INDIA bloc forming govt in near future</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/nda-allies-have-too-many-demands-mamata-banerjee-hints-at-india-bloc-forming-govt-in-near-future/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/2024060860.jfif", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:19:12", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.424}

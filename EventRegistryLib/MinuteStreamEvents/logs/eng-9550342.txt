It feels off. It hit a nerve: People are concerned with human creativity being replaced by tech, like the iPad. It's a rare misstep for Apple advertising.\n\nApple's promotional video for the newly upgraded iPad Pro has struck a discordant tone. CEO Tim Cook, who tweeted it, is being ratioed to the heavens on X over the ad.\n\nThe video shows a large pile of creative tools -- cans of paint, a piano, a trumpet, a record player, books, a vintage arcade video game -- being slowly crushed in a hydraulic press.\n\nWhen the press reopens, it's all replaced by the ultrathin iPad Pro.\n\nOf course, it's meant to show off how an iPad is a great tool for creatives.\n\nBut it also struck a raw nerve. We're in a moment of heightened anxiety about the idea of AI replacing human creativity. Already, visual artists, photographers, musicians, and writers are seeing that their work can be mimicked by AI -- and they see it as a very real threat to their livelihoods.

With the introduction of the Pro tablet, Cupertino rolled out one of its known fun ads called Crush. However, people are not fond of this advertisement this time, as it's been referred to online as \"tone deaf\" and \"offensive.\"\n\nThe minute-long ad shows toys, musical instruments, sculptures, and more being crushed by enormous weight. This kind of hydraulic crush video is very popular on TikTok. In this case, Apple probably just wanted to show that you can combine several iconic products and symbols into a single piece of metal and glass: The new M4 iPad Pro with an outstanding OLED display.\n\nHowever, consumers do not see this iPad Pro ad that way. For example, in Tim Cook's X post, people are furious at Apple for this ad.\n\n\"I can't believe this is real? Incredibly tone deaf,\" said X user Michael J. Miraflor. Another user, Damon Peters, went further and explained why many people hated this ad: \"(...) I was offended because it's a direct shot at GenX and some Millennial culture and values. The offense is from caring deeply about the collective human experience as progressive, not replacement. Why destroy what we love to progress? Seems mean for the sake of being mean.\"\n\nAt first, I didn't think this ad could be an issue. After all, it's just Apple telling a story about how users don't need several objects, as only one can replace most. For example, why would you need a piano if you have GarageBand? Or why would you need several paint buckets if you can use an app with all the colors you need to create something?\n\nAfter all, the story is that the company has built a crazy-thin and powerful iPad Pro. At the end of the day, it's all people would need. In addition, this is likely all CGI, especially when an emoji-like toy is pressed alone with its eyes facing us.\n\nBut since so many people have complained about it, this ad might not be that innocent. And people are right about thinking crushing real-world symbols in favor of a digital world is a bad, soulless idea. At the end of the day, Apple is just another company trying to sell a product to consumers. However, if you think about the company's long history, I wouldn't say it wants to erase the real world, but maybe the ad could have been made differently.\n\nBelow, you can watch the iPad Pro ad and decide if Apple went too far or was just a misinterpretation.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_adorno@bgr.com", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Adorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Genius_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Genius Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageBand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GarageBand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipad-pro-ad-bgr.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Much of the engagement came from replies and reposts with commentary from users, some who went as far as telling Apple it should pull the ad and recut it.\n\n\"This ad is (unintentional) perfect metaphor for today's creative dark age: compress organic instruments, joyful/imperfect machines, tangible art, our entire physical reality into a soulless, postmodern, read-only device a multi-trillion $ corporation controls what you do with,\" Adam Singer, the vice president of marketing at advertising technology company AdQuick, posted on X.\n\n\"Can't believe Apple ran such an out of touch commercial that treats devices Steve Jobs would have cherished as trash,\" Eric Newcomer, who runs a tech-focused newsletter and events company, also posted on X.\n\nOne X user said the new ad is a \"bookend\" to the ad the company released in 1984 to unveil its first Macintosh computer. In that commercial, a woman dressed in bright orange shorts runs through an eerie scene out of George Orwell's \"1984\" depicting rows of people dressed in gray watching propaganda on a screen. She throws an ax to break the screen, seemingly freeing them from their trance.\n\n\"1984: Monochome, conformist, industrial world exploded by colourful, vibrant human,\" the user wrote. \"2024: Colourful, vibrant humanity is crushed by monochrome, conformist industrial press.\"\n\nApple remains a tech behemoth.

Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online - Medicine Hat News", "body": "In this image taken from a video advertisement, a hydraulic press crushes an array of creative instruments .The newly-released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. (Apple via AP)NEW YORK (AP) - A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years - from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\"\u009d a narrator says at the end of the commercial. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf - with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution didn't land. \"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\"\u009d said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\u009d The ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\"\u009d by technological advances - particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note. Several celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\"\u009d commercial on social media this week. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\"\u009d actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad. Some found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today - particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\" Experts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past - which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches. \"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\"\u009d Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said. Graves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, \"~No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\" In a statement shared with Ad Age on Thursday, Apple apologized for the ad. The outlet also reported that Apple no longer plans to run the spot on TV. \"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\"\u009d Tor Myhren, the company's vice president of marketing communications, told Ad Age. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\u009d Cupertino, California-based Apple unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display. Apple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple's success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company's sales.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ad Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Commonwealth University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240509130544-663d0c43167b340b8753782cjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

To seemingly demonstrate how thin the new iPad is, the ad features musical instruments, art supplies, sculptures, games, and records being crushed by a hydraulic press. After the machine has destroyed all the other objects, it leaves to reveal the iPad intact.\n\nBut the ad isn't having the effect that Apple might have wanted: Some on X said the symbolism of destroying cultural and artistic objects is dark and upsetting.\n\nTim Cook, Apple's CEO, attempted to cast the ad in an inspirational light in a tweet yesterday.\n\n\"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create,\" Cook tweeted, implying that multiple creative endeavors -- like making music or creating art -- can be accomplished using an iPad.\n\nResponses to the ad on X were visceral and overwhelmingly negative.\n\n\"I'm a creator, a traditional artist, a Macintosh user of many years, yet I never even understand why would I need an iPad,\" an X user replied to Cook's tweet. \"This destruction is extremely distasteful and would never convince me but otherwise.\"\n\n\"It is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement,\" another person said. \"When I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.\"\n\n\"Crushing symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements to appeal to pro creators,\" an X user replied. \"Maybe for the next Apple Watch Pro you should crush sports equipment, show a robot running faster than a man, then turn to the camera and say, 'God is dead and we have killed him.'\"\n\nOthers said the ad and its spirit are a symbol of the current state of the tech industry, which is now dominated by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"This new ad by Apple perfectly depicts what Big Tech has sadly come to stand for: crushing human creativity in the name of technological innovation and selling it to us as progress,\" an X user wrote. \"It's tone-deaf at least, malicious at worst, in the current climate of AI replacing human arts.\"\n\n\"An ad showing beautiful tools of human creativity being crushed to be replaced by the newest and thinnest gadget feels antithetical to Apple,\" another person said. \"I'd

Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online", "body": "A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution didn't land.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\" by technological advances -- particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\" commercial on social media this week.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today -- particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past -- which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n\"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\" Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, 'No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.\"'\n\nIn a statement shared with Ad Age on Thursday, Apple apologized for the ad. The outlet also reported that Apple no longer plans to run the spot on TV.\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Tor Myhren, the company's vice president of marketing communications, told Ad Age. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nCupertino, California-based Apple unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17 per cent from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple's success. It currently accounts for just 6 per cent of the company's sales.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ad Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Commonwealth University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/9/ipad-1-6880318-1715277367491.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Now, this destructive ad is understandably garnering major public backlash, ironically from the creative-minded people Apple marketed its iPad Pro to during the event.\n\nIt's unclear whether Apple was trying to convey a message of \"Wow, look how thin the new iPad is\" or \"Look at all these creative tools that you don't need anymore because of the iPad Pro.\" Regardless of the intended primary message, the ad felt extremely tone-deaf, and watching musical instruments, books, an arcade machine, and other items be demolished for an ad was just... painful.\n\nBecause Apple keeps comments turned off on most of its YouTube videos, there aren't any spicy takes to dive into there. But on the rest of the internet? Apple's getting torn apart.\n\nAlmost all of the replies to Tim Cook's tweet (which surprisingly hasn't been taken down yet) are negative. And with his ironic statement, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create\" to describe the new iPad Pro, this isn't a shock.\n\nX user Michael Vokabre (@Vokabre) is \"a creator, a traditional artist, a macintosh user of many years\" and deems the ad's destruction \"extremely distasteful.\" Many people in the comment thread share the same thoughts, with user @usaotoday saying the ad \"lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators.\"\n\nQuite a few celebrities are also insulted by Apple's ad. Actor Hugh Grant retweeted Tim Cook's post and said, \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\" Actress Justine Bateman also retweeted it, with a simple question of \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"\n\nWhen new products were announced on r/Apple after the 'Let Loose' event, Redditor @Penitent_Exile said that the \"promo was painful to watch\" and how you'd \"expect a video of something created not destroyed from a company that stresses how creators are important.\"\n\nThat last quote perfectly sums up why most people are angered and confused by the ad. Even during the 'Let Loose' event, Apple was promoting the iPad's tools for creative professionals, so who thought it would be a good idea to destroy creative tools (and symbolically, creativity) as a way to get people to buy the new iPad?\n\nAnd here's the big kicker: Apple's most recent ad is almost a reversal of the company's own 1984 Super Bowl commercial by Ridley Scott. X user James Clark (@mr_james_c) sums up this comparison perfectly, calling the new 'Crush!' ad a \"visual and metaphorical bookend to the 1984 ad.\"\n\nClark writes, \"1984: [Monochrome], conformist, industrial world exploded by colourful, vibrant human,\" followed by \"2024: Colourful, vibrant humanity is crushed by monochrome, conformist industrial press.\"\n\nApple hasn't publicly addressed the backlash yet, but what is there to say? It's possible that some of the items destroyed in the ad were old items that were going to be trashed anyway, and other items might not have been real (two monitors in the ad look like they're made of cardboard), but the looming messages of creative destruction and wastefulness are still there.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_chaney@laptopmag.com", "name": "Sarah Chaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arcade cabinet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_commercials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl commercials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promotional recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monochrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gXUZzHBBDeaZPRDFEGpWd-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 38, "textEnd": 43}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online", "body": "A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\" by technological advances -- particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\" commercial on social media this week.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today -- particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past -- which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n\"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\" Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, 'No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple's success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company's sales.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wyatte_grantham_philips@register-herald.com", "name": "Wyatte Grantham-Philips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Commonwealth University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

And often this line is determined by the context, by the sentiments prevailing in that particular moment in time. The latest to get a shock from good intentions, and despite a rather cool and slick advertisement, is Apple that just a day ago aired the new iPad Pro ad called Crush. The advertisement has sparked an unusual backlash from creative professionals, who also often happen to be core Apple users. Many professionals, including award winning writers and filmmakers, say that the ad highlights supremacy of machines and AI over human creativity and that, they say, is just plain wrong.\n\nSo, what's this ad? Titled Crush, the advertisement seems to be inspired by the meme videos of hydraulic press crushing objects. The commercial shows a big machine squashing all sorts of stuff, like old TVs, musical instruments, and books, and turning them magically into the new iPad Pro. The background music is set to Sonny and Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You\".\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook shared the commercial on his X account and wrote, \"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip. Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nThis is a slick ad and it does succeed in highlighting what Apple wants to highlight -- that is now people can use the new iPad Pro to get similar kind of functionality that currently they were getting from 10 different devices and objects.\n\nUnfortunately for Apple, the ad also comes at a time when professionals -- and more so in creative industries -- are anxious and jittery about AI tools doing their work. And in that context, the Crush advertisement seems to give the impression that creativity is all dead -- crushed by a machine -- and that future now belongs to one single device that will create whatever human artists are creating nowadays but without the same joy and verve that instruments likes paintbrush, drums, pens, and cellos provide.\n\nMany creative professions took to Twitter to slam the advertisement. Apple CEO Tim Cook's tweet with the Crush ad has been quote tweeted thousands of times, mostly with critical comments. Even big names have chimed in.\n\nActor Hugh Grant called the Crush ad \"the destruction of the human experience\" by Silicon Valley.\n\nProducer Asif Kapadia pointed out how tech giants often benefit from artists' work without giving them fair compensation. \"Like iPads but don't know why anyone thought this ad was a good idea. It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to the arts, to artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it's all created by them,\" he posted on X.\n\nFilmmaker Justine Bateman also reposted Cook's post and asked \"What's wrong with you?\"\n\nAward-winning writer Hari Kunzru too tweeted the Crush ad, saying: \"Crushing the symbols of human creativity to produce a homogenized branded slab is pretty much where the tech industry is at in 2024.\"\n\nOthers, like actor Luke Barnett, felt the ad was just plain weird, while filmmaker Reza Sixo Safai even made a reverse version of it to make a point, indicating that the video in reverse is better metaphorically.\n\nWhile Apple is not new to criticism, generally the company does not face it usually from creative professionals who are some of the most hardcore Apple users. Most of the company's products are used by professionals in creative industries and Apple often collaborates with film directors, photographers, musicians and artists to highlight capabilities of its phones. For now the company hasn't commented on the backlash the Crush advertisement has received.\n\nAs for the product in question -- the new iPad Pro with M4 chip -- it indeed pushes boundaries of what is possible with a tablet. In particular, Apple highlights new versions of Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro on the new iPad that will likely help creative professionals do their work faster and more efficiently. The new iPad Pro also pairs with the new Pencil Pro, which comes with a set of sensors that will likely help illustrators and artists. The new products were launched at Apple's Let Loose event on May 7.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crush (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logic Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Kapadia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asif Kapadia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final Cut Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcore punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/ipad-pro-094929542-16x9_0.png?VersionId=NCRtBBJHzG6FhaawdMXS_7BJ50KgjuOO", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 4344, "textEnd": 4349}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It shows paints, guitars, toys, sculptures, and more, all being crushed down by an enormous weight, which then rises up again to reveal the iPad Pro.\n\nSince that debut during the event, Apple's Tim Cook tweeted a link to it -- and started a backlash. At time of writing, there are over 2,500 comments to his tweet and while many are about iPad details, most are expressing abhorrence at the ad.\n\n\"It is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement,\" responded Twitter user Hiroki Akiyama. \"When I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.\"\n\n\"This destruction is extremely distasteful,\" wrote another user. Others say the ad \"lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators.\"\n\n\"Genuinely apple's creepiest ad since the Mother Earth DEl debacle,\" continue the comments. \"Oh my, that's a scary advertisement.\"\n\nIt's likely that at least some of the ad was created with CGI. This is proven by moments like the toy's face somehow specifically being face-out and caught by the camera with the precision that it was. Hydraulic presses are crazily expensive, and there would be a wide field of debris and stains on the press if it were real, as well.\n\nIt doesn't appear that the high likelihood that the video is CGI alters the reactions. \"Even if this Movie is CG,\" writes one commentator, \"it pains me to see this kind of Creative-destroying representation.\"\n\nTim Cook also posted the video on Chinese social media site Weibo, where at time of writing it's had around 250 comments -- and hardly any criticism. \"This advertising idea is so amazing,\" says one user (in translation.)\n\nApple has also posted the complete ad on YouTube.

Posted on social media Tuesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ad starts off as a sort of time capsule for human creativity.\n\nThere's a metronome. A record player. Then the lights come on in a warehouse-like room, where you see those items and dozens of other creative tools sitting on a metal slab in the center of the shot. There's also a CRT TV, cans of paint, a globe of the Earth, a piano, an '80s arcade video game, a sculptural bust of a human head and a trumpet. Another giant metal slab hangs ominously above it all.\n\nAs we hear the opening words of \"All I Ever Need Is You,\" a 1972 single by Sonny & Cher, the metal slab starts descending.\n\nThe items are in a giant hydraulic press, and within about 40 seconds everything will be gone -- crushed under tons of force in an often dramatic fashion.\n\nAfter the destruction, the hydraulic press starts rising again. The debris is now gone. In its place is a shiny, new iPad Pro. A voiceover says, \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nCher closes out the minute-long spot, crooning \"All I ever need is you.\"\n\nVideos of hydraulic presses demolishing everything from electronics to candy have become very popular in the past few years, in part due to the often mesmerizing nature of the way things collapse under pressure.\n\nApple is seemingly trying to capitalize on this trend while making a point about how its new iPad Pro is so powerful it can replace other means of creative expression.\n\nBut for many viewers, the ad doesn't land the right note.\n\n\"I'm not sure 'wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is (sic) this world' was really the vibe you were trying for,\" says one commenter on X.\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" says another.\n\nCNN has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nOthers say that even though they understand what the ad is trying to say, it doesn't resonate with them.\n\n\"It's a creative concept & good execution, but wow the ad made me surprising (sic) sad!\" says one X user. \"The song choice also seems to especially idolize tech over real life. Now I just want to avoid screens & spend more time enjoying the world offline.\"\n\n\"It should have been about capturing and honoring the essence of what's so special about all of those things and experiences to bring them together in a device, not crushing the soul out of them,\" says another person on X.\n\nMany people agreed with this sentiment, saying the ad would have been better in reverse.\n\nThis isn't the first time an ad may not have landed the way a company expected -- think the infamous Peloton holiday ad or the Kendall Jenner ad for Pepsi. But with fears that AI could replace workers in many industries -- and the increasingly worrying research about how prolonged social media use affect us -- many consumers are growing wary of technology.\n\n\"This ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people think technology is killing everything we ever found joy in. And then presents that as a good thing,\" says a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. \"I haven't seen such a visceral backlash to a spot in a long time.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bust (sculpture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metronome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_business_articles_764/191d59fe06873b1316a01220d45500c2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Its new ad for the iPad Pro, however, is likely to be remembered for the wrong reasons.\n\nAs we've come to expect, Apple's Let Loose event included an advert for the product on show, the iPad Pro. The commercial has the high production values and stylishness we're used to seeing in Apple ads, but the way it depicts the latest tablet has led to plenty of backlash online, including from celebrities.\n\nThe ad, which you can see above, shows a giant press being slowly lowered, crushing a number of musical instruments, classical sculptures, books, paints, games, cameras, and more. When it retracts, we see an iPad Pro left in its place.\n\nApple's message is obviously that everything being crushed can essentially be replicated using a very thin iPad Pro: reading books, making music, playing games, watching TV, drawing, etc. CEO Tim Cook pushed this point home on X when he asked, \"imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nWhile Apple has used this sort of message in the past, it comes at a time when fears that technology is killing human creativity and costing jobs have peaked.\n\nActor Hugh Grant was particularly scathing, replying to Cook's post with, \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nJustine Bateman, the filmmaker and actor who advised SAG-AFTRA on AI issues, wrote \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"\n\nBeyond actors, there are plenty of musicians, writers, artists, and plenty of other professions worried about AI's impact on their livelihoods.\n\nApple talked at length about the M4's enhanced AI performance during its Let Loose event. The iPad Pro is being hailed as the company's first true AI device ahead of what will likely be a very AI-focused WWDC in June.\n\nJames Kochalka, the comic book artist, writer, animator, and rock musician, highlighted the problematic destruction in Apple's ad. \"I'm definitely the target audience for the new iPad Pro but this ad is tone-deaf and insulting to artists of every kind. We think of our tools with reverence and respect, and enjoy a healthy dialogue with them. Our tools are like trusted companions on the journey of art.\"\n\nAs per the BBC, the ad appears to have caused particular offense to people in Japan, with several saying it \"lacked respect.\"\n\n\"The act of destroying tools is arrogant and offensive to us Japanese,\" one person explained, while another said that musicians value their instruments \"more than life itself.\"\n\nOthers have noted how the ad stands in contrast to the famous 1984 ad, with Cupertino having taken the place of IBM, its then rival, as the faceless megacorporation Apple was rebelling against.\n\nOne of the most damning criticisms came from Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, who said that the late Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs \"wouldn't have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch.\"", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_thubron@techspot.com", "name": "Rob Thubron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Get a Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hodgman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Hodgman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Potato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Long", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cartoonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/ts3_thumbs/2024/05/2024-05-09-ts3_thumbs-a1b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Shared by CEO Tim Cook, Apple's commercial has failed to impress a section of viewers.\n\nWhat Is Apple's iPad Pro's new ad?\n\nThe advertisement commenced with a towering hydraulic press poised above an array of eclectic items such as musical instruments, paint cans, a gaming console, speakers, and sculptures. The first item to succumb to the press was a trumpet, followed by a cascade of flattened paint cans. The grand piano was next in line.\n\nAfter the hydraulic press had flattened everything, even causing the eye of a ball-shaped emoji to pop out, it ascended to reveal the brand-new and remarkably sleek iPad Pro. The concept of the commercial aimed to showcase how the tablet enables users to engage in a multitude of activities, including music playing, photo and video capture, and creation, all in a sleek and streamlined format.\n\nWatch the ad here:\n\n\"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip.

Hollywood actor Hugh Grant, an Emmy-winning director have called out Apple for the ad\n\nWhen Apple unveiled the iPad Pro at the Let Loose event, it showcased it through an ad titled \"Crushed\". The ad begins with all kinds of creative tools -- a piano, a record player, books, a vintage video game, and even cans of paint -- getting brutally crushed in a hydraulic press.\n\nWhen the crushing is done, out comes the new and thin iPad Pro. Pretty slick, huh? Reminds us of when Apple convinced everyone an iPod held your entire music collection (remember those?). So the strategy is good but the timing perhaps isn't.\n\nThere has already been too much fear (irrational?) about technology gazumping human jobs and AI tools threatening creative pros like artists, musicians and others.\n\nThe ad hasn't gone down well, at least on social media. Even Hollywood actor Hugh Grant commented on it. Apple CEO Tim Cook posted the ad on his X account and got a reply from Grant who said, \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nThe artistic community wasn't also too appreciative of the message Apple seems to be sending with the ad. Ed Solomon, screenwriter for Men in Black posted \"Who needs human life and everything that makes it worth living? Dive into this digital simulacrum and give us your soul. Sincerely, Apple.\"\n\nReed Morano, Emmy-winning director of Handmaid's Tale tagged Cook in a post and said, \"READ THE ROOM, BRO. CUZ THIS SHIT IS ACTUALLY PSYCHOTIC [sic]\".\n\nApple hasn't made any comment on the ad and is unlikely to do. As we said, the ad is actually on point and does depict what it is meant to do -- showcase the technological prowess of the new iPad Pro.

Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online - Medicine Hat News", "body": "In this image taken from a video advertisement, a hydraulic press crushes an array of creative instruments .The newly-released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. (Apple via AP)NEW YORK (AP) - A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. The ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years - from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro. \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\"\u009d a narrator says at the end of the commercial. Apple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf - with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark. \"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\"\u009d said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\u009d The ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\"\u009d by technological advances - particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note. Several celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\"\u009d commercial on social media this week. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\"\u009d actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad. Some found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today - particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\" Experts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past - which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches. \"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\"\u009d Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said. Graves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, \"~No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\" Apple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday. The Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display. Apple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period.

Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad causes shock online - ExBulletin", "body": "NEW YORK -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has caused quite a stir online.\n\nThe ad, released Tuesday by the tech giant, features a hydraulic press that uses nearly every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years, from pianos and record players to paints, books, cameras, and piles of arcade game relics. It depicts how it is crushed. . The result of destruction? A brand new iPad Pro.\n\nThe most powerful iPad ever made is also the thinnest, says the narrator at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intent is simple. Let's take a look at everything you can do with this new product. But critics have called this insensitive, and several marketing experts say the campaign misses the mark.\n\nAmecas Reed II, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said I had a very unpleasant reaction to this ad. I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but...the message was that technology was crushing the (old) nostalgic kind of life of joy. think.\n\nThe ad also comes at a time when many people are feeling anxious and fearful about their jobs and daily lives being replaced by technological advancements, especially with the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. Appeared. And the fear of seeing beloved items destroyed and faded into oblivion cannot be quelled, Reid and others say.\n\nSome celebrities were among those criticizing Apple's crash! We released a commercial on social media this week.\n\nDestruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley, actor Hugh Grant wrote on social media platform X in a repost of an ad shared by Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nSome saw the ad as a metaphor for concerns about how today's industry, especially big technology, is having a negative impact on creativity. Film director Justin Bateman wrote in \"X'' that commercials are destroying art. \"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marks a marked departure from past Apple marketing, which often took a more positive and uplifting approach.\n\nMy first thought was that Apple had become exactly what it didn't want to be, said Van Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Brand Center.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused on increasing creativity and thinking outside the box as unique individuals. In contrast, this (new iPad) commercial was \"No, we were going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to force it into one device that everyone would use,\" Graves added.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company announced the latest generation iPad Pro and Air at a showcase earlier this week, touting new features in both lines. The Pro features a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage, and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to stimulate demand for the iPad after tablet sales fell 17% in the first quarter from a year ago. The iPad didn't contribute much to Apple's success after its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market.

Posted on social media Tuesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ad starts off as a sort of time capsule for human creativity.\n\nThere's a metronome. A record player. Then the lights come on in a warehouse-like room, where you see those items and dozens of other creative tools sitting on a metal slab in the center of the shot. There's also a CRT TV, cans of paint, a globe of the Earth, a piano, an '80s arcade video game, a sculptural bust of a human head and a trumpet. Another giant metal slab hangs ominously above it all.\n\nAs we hear the opening words of \"All I Ever Need Is You,\" a 1972 single by Sonny & Cher, the metal slab starts descending.\n\nThe items are in a giant hydraulic press, and within about 40 seconds everything will be gone -- crushed under tons of force in an often dramatic fashion.\n\nAfter the destruction, the hydraulic press starts rising again. The debris is now gone. In its place is a shiny, new iPad Pro. A voiceover says, \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nCher closes out the minute-long spot, crooning \"All I ever need is you.\"\n\nVideos of hydraulic presses demolishing everything from electronics to candy have become very popular in the past few years, in part due to the often mesmerizing nature of the way things collapse under pressure.\n\nApple is seemingly trying to capitalize on this trend while making a point about how its new iPad Pro is so powerful it can replace other means of creative expression.\n\nBut for many viewers, the ad doesn't land the right note.\n\n\"I'm not sure 'wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is (sic) this world' was really the vibe you were trying for,\" says one commenter on X.\n\nEven emoji aren't safe from the hydraulic press in Apple's iPad Pro ad. From Apple\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" says another.\n\nCNN has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nOthers say that even though they understand what the ad is trying to say, it doesn't resonate with them.\n\n\"It's a creative concept & good execution, but wow the ad made me surprising (sic) sad!\" says one X user. \"The song choice also seems to especially idolize tech over real life. Now I just want to avoid screens & spend more time enjoying the world offline.\"\n\n\"It should have been about capturing and honoring the essence of what's so special about all of those things and experiences to bring them together in a device, not crushing the soul out of them,\" says another person on X.\n\nMany people agreed with this sentiment, saying the ad would have been better in reverse.\n\nThis isn't the first time an ad may not have landed the way a company expected -- think the infamous Peloton holiday ad or the Kendall Jenner ad for Pepsi. But with fears that AI could replace workers in many industries -- and the increasingly worrying research about how prolonged social media use affect us -- many consumers are growing wary of technology.\n\n\"This ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people think technology is killing everything we ever found joy in. And then presents that as a good thing,\" says a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. \"I haven't seen such a visceral backlash to a spot in a long time.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metronome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/screen-shot-2024-05-08-at-4-15-59-pm.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

In the Apple ad which is titled \"Crush!\", an industrial press is shown \"crushing\" various objects including a TV, musical instruments, books, and more, all to the tune of Sonny and Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You.\"\n\nThe ad, shared by Apple CEO Tim Cook on X, highlights the versatility of the iPad Pro in consuming and creating content, ranging from TV shows and movies to music, games, books, and photos. However, rather than being seen as a celebration of technological innovation, the ad has sparked ire among many in Hollywood and other creative industries. Critics view the commercial as a metaphorical representation of the tech industry's encroachment on and destruction of traditional cultural mediums.\n\nMost notably, English actor Hugh Grant has called it \"the destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nAmerican actor, writer, and producer Luke Barnette said, \"If you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, filmmaker Reza Sixo Safai shared an alternate version of the same ad running in reverse, commenting, \"Hey @Apple, I fixed it for you.\"\n\nThe juxtaposition of the iPad Pro's sleek design and power of its M4 silicon with the destruction of iconic objects like record players, pianos, guitars, typewriters, and arcade game machines has been interpreted as a commentary on the perceived threat technology poses to traditional forms of entertainment and artistic expression.\n\nWhile Apple may have intended to highlight the iPad Pro's potential for creativity and productivity, the ad inadvertently underscores concerns about the impact of technology on industries that rely on physical media and craftsmanship.\n\nThe \"Crush!\" ad has sparked a broader conversation about the intersection of technology and culture and where to draw the line. Of course, a line may be a dot to some which is to say that it's all very subjective. But looking at how the ad has triggered a whole bunch of people across the world, it only goes to show the power that Apple commands in shaping trends and conversations.\n\nApple's iconic Super Bowl commercial, \"1984,\" directed by Ridley Scott, stands out as one of the most legendary ads in history. Back in the day, it would urge consumers to challenge IBM's PC dominance and go buy the Macintosh instead.

Burn.\" This campaign encouraged users to create their own playlists from CDs, regardless of the potential impact on the music industry's economics.\n\n\"Forty years ago, Apple released the 1984 commercial as a bold statement against a dystopian future,\" writer Yuval Kordov posted on X. \"Now you are that dystopian future.

The company also said it won't air the ad on television as planned.\n\nThe ad, which depicted musical instruments, TVs, paint cans and other creative tools being crushed into an iPad, was widely ridiculed on social media -- an unprecedented response for an Apple marketing campaign. Actor Hugh Grant said the ad promoted the \"destruction of the human experience.\"\n\nOthers said the advertisement didn't bode well for Apple in the age of artificial intelligence and as regulators look to break up key properties like the App Store.\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Tor Myhren, the company's vice president of marketing communications, said in a statement to AdAge. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment further. The ad, which remains on the X account of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, has over 53 million views. The campaign cast a shadow over an otherwise positive introduction of major new iPad versions and a new M4 chip on Tuesday.\n\nOne user wrote that \"this ad effectively convinced me I need less technology in my life,\" while others said it made them \"hate\" Apple products. \"Totally unnecessary and extremely depressing ad!,\" another user said. \"For me, it had the opposite effect of what Apple wanted.\"\n\nRead More: Apple's Tone-Deaf iPad Ad Triggers Our Darkest AI Fears\n\nApple has an in-house marketing team that creates many of its advertisements, while it also works with agency Media Arts Lab for some campaigns.

For one of two reasons.\n\nApple's new iPad Pro ad seems to fall into the latter category. The ad, posted by Apple CEO Tim Cook on social media on Tuesday, began as a kind of time capsule of human creativity.\n\nThere is a metronome. record player. The lights in the warehouse-like room then turn on and we see dozens of these items and other creative tools placed on a metal plate in the center of the shot. There's also a cathode ray tube television, paint cans, a globe, a piano, an 80s arcade video game, and a sculptural bust of a human head and a trumpet. Another giant metal plate hangs ominously above it.\n\nThe metal plate begins to descend as the first words of Sonny & Cher's 1972 single \"All I Ever Need Is You\" are heard.\n\nThe items are put into a giant hydraulic press and within about 40 seconds everything is crushed with a huge amount of force in a dramatic way.\n\nAfter destruction, the hydraulic press will start rising again. Now the debris is gone. In its place is a shiny new iPad Pro. The voiceover says, \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nCher concluded her one-minute spot by singing, \"All I ever need is you.\"\n\nVideos of hydraulic presses destroying everything from electronics to candy have become extremely popular over the past few years, in part because the way things crumble under pressure is often mesmerizing.\n\nApple appears to be trying to capitalize on this trend, making the case for how powerful the new iPad Pro is and can replace other means of creative expression.\n\nHowever, for many viewers, this ad did not get the attention it deserved.\n\nI'm not sure that wanton destruction of everything good and beautiful is really the atmosphere you wanted this world to have, said one of the commenters on X.\n\nI can't relate to this video at all. Others say it lacks respect for creative equipment and mocks creators.\n\nSome people may understand what the ad is trying to say, but it doesn't resonate with them.\n\nCreative concept and great execution, but wow, this ad made me surprisingly (sic) sad. One X user says: The song selection also seems to particularly fetishize technology over real life. Right now, I want to avoid screens and spend more time enjoying the offline world.\n\nIt was about capturing and honoring the essence of what was special about all those things and experiences and integrating them into one device, not about crushing the soul, says another at X.\n\nMany people agreed with this opinion and said that the ad would have been better the other way around.\n\nThis isn't the first time an ad hasn't turned out the way a company expected, like Peloton's infamous holiday ad or Kendall Jenner's Pepsi ad. But with concerns that AI could replace workers in many industries, and a growing body of research worrying about the impact long-term use of social media has on us, many of consumers are becoming increasingly wary of technology.\n\nThis ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people believe technology is destroying everything we used to find joy in. And they're presenting that as a good thing, says a Wall Street Journal reporter. It's been a while since I've seen such a visceral reaction to the scene.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathode-ray tube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metronome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/screen-shot-2024-05-08-at-4-15-59-pm.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

We missed the mark with this video, and we are sorry.\"\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment further. The ad, which remains on the X account of chief executive officer Tim Cook, has over 53 million views. The campaign cast a shadow over an otherwise positive introduction of major new iPad versions and a new M4 chip on Tuesday (May 7).\n\nOne user wrote that \"this ad effectively convinced me I need less technology in my life,\" while others said it made them \"hate\" Apple products. \"Totally unnecessary and extremely depressing ad!,\" another user said. \"For me, it had the opposite effect of what Apple wanted.\"\n\nApple has an in-house marketing team that creates many of its advertisements, while it also works with agency Media Arts Lab for some campaigns.

The newly released ad promoting the new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online. Apple via AP\n\nNEW YORK -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years - from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf, with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\" by technological advances - particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others noted.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\" commercial on social media this week.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today - particularly concerns about Big Tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past, which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n\"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\" said Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, 'No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period.

Apple's 'Disturbing' New IPad Ad Has Struck a Nerve Online", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\" by technological advances -- particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\" commercial on social media this week.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today -- particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past -- which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n\"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\" Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, 'No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple's success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company's sales.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Actually, many responses to the ad are downright negative because people seem to grasp what Apple was trying to communicate, but they are taking umbrage with the mechanisms (and probably unintentional symbolism) used to deliver that message.\n\nTo get right to the point here: Apple will soon (next week) begin shipping its newest iPad Pro model. CEO Tim Cook thusly tweeted an ad, in which he promises, \"[T]he thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip.\" He then added, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nThe intent here, presumably, was to suggest that the results of these creative mechanisms and instruments could fit into an extremely thin iPad Pro and into the storage capacities involved with the M4 chip. Yet visually speaking, this happens in the ad at the expense of these tools of creativity. The \"Crush\" title of the ad is meant literally, which means using an industrial crusher to flatten and destroy instruments, books, cameras, and other beloved creative symbols. Not to mention what happened to this poor little critter:\n\nThe iPad itself is a groundbreaking innovation and useful to millions of people (myself included) on a daily basis. However, let's just say that even loyal Apple users are not impressed with \"a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement.\" The term \"demonic inversion\" has also popped into the mix as well as a response directly to Tim Cook: \"Your predecessors showed us their dreams, you showed us our nightmares.\"\n\nHowever, this ad is racking up views on YouTube like wildfire, so the product visibility is certainly there. We'll see what people think when the model is released into the world.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kimberly_riccifilm@uproxx.com", "name": "Kimberly RicciFilm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_motorway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M4 motorway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipadpro-sm.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Then it cuts to a record player, and then finally to the image of a giant hydraulic press, where the metronome, the record player, several musical instruments, an arcade video game, and other items sit, waiting to be crushed.\n\nThe 1972 song \"All I Ever Need Is You\" by Sonny & Cher begins to play, and the metal slab of the hydraulic press descends onto the precious items. We watch a trumpet get crushed, followed by paint cans, a clay sculpture of a person's head, an angry bird doll, an old fashioned television, cameras, a guitar, books, and plush emoji toys. Finally, after the press has crushed all the items, the metal slab lifts up again, and an iPad is revealed to be underneath. \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" says a disembodied female voice. An Apple logo appears on screen, and in exactly one minute, the ad is over.\n\nThe ad was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside the caption: \"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip.

Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nAnother commenter suggested that the ad would have worked much better if it was played in reverse, and objects were shown as expanding out of the iPad instead of being crushed by it.\n\nTIME has reached out to Apple and Tim Cook for comment.\n\nApple may well have been trying to seize on the trend of hydraulic press videos, which have become popular in recent years.

Once the destruction is complete, the press lifts back up to reveal that the items have been replaced by a slender, shimmering iPad.\n\nThe notion behind the commercial is fairly obvious. Apple wants to show you that the bulk of human ingenuity and history can be compressed into an iPad, and thereby wants you to believe that the device is a desirable entry point to both the consumption of culture and the creation of it. (The ad is for the latest \"Pro\" model of the iPad, the price of which starts at $999 and goes as high as $2,299, depending on its configuration.) Most important, it wants you to know that the iPad is powerful and quite thin.\n\nBut good lord, Apple, read the room. In its swing for spectacle, the ad lacks so much self-awareness, it's cringey, even depressing. This is May 2024: Humanity is in the early stages of a standoff with generative AI, which offers methods through which visual art, writing, music, and computer code can be created by a machine in seconds with the simplest of prompts. Apple is reportedly building its own large language model for its devices, and its CEO, Tim Cook, explicitly invoked AI in his comments about the new tablet: The iPad Pro features, he said, an \"outrageously powerful chip for AI.\" Most of us are still in the sizing-up phase for generative AI, staring warily at a technology that's been hyped as world-changing and job-disrupting (even, some proponents argue, potentially civilization-ending), and been foisted on the public in a very short period of time. It's a weird, exhausting, exciting, even tense moment. Enter: THE CRUSHER.\n\nApple is very good at defining the zeitgeist as it relates to how humans use technology to interact with the world. Announced with a Super Bowl commercial in 1984, the Macintosh ushered in the era of personal computing by presenting streamlined hardware and a pleasant graphical interface; iTunes and the iPod augured a world of limitless media; and the iPhone delivered on its promise to fit the entire universe in our pocket. There is about a 0 percent chance that the company did not understand the optics of releasing this ad at this moment. Apple is among the most sophisticated and moneyed corporations in all the world. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBut this time, it's hard to like what the company is showing us. People are angry. One commenter on X called the ad \"heartbreaking.\" Three reasons could explain why. First: Although watching things explode might be fun, it's less fun when a multitrillion-dollar tech corporation is the one destroying tools, instruments, and other objects of human expression and creativity. Second, of course, is that this is a moment of great technological upheaval and angst, especially among artists, as tech companies build models trained off of creative work with an ultimate goal of simulating those very peoples' skilled output. It is easy to be offended at the ad's implication, and it is easy to be aghast at the idea that AI will wipe out human creativity with cheap synthetic waste.\n\nRead: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and tech\n\nThe third-order annoyance is in the genre. Apple has, essentially, aped a popular format of \"crushing\" videos on TikTok, wherein hydraulic presses are employed to obliterate everyday objects for the pleasure of idle scrollers. Arguably the company thought that copying this specific motif would be fun, but something is grim about Apple trying to draft off a viral-video format to sell units. It's unclear whether some of the ad might have been created with CGI, but Apple could easily round up tens of thousands of dollars of expensive equipment and destroy it all on a whim. However small, the ad is a symbol of the company's dominance.\n\nThe ad remains, in some sense, great marketing. Everyone is talking about the iPad, a mainstay in Apple's lineup that nonetheless gets far less attention than the iPhone. But this sudden interest offers room for a genuine appraisal of the device 14 years after its release. The iPad was one of Steve Jobs's final products, one he believed could become as popular and perhaps as transformative as cars. That vision hasn't panned out. The iPad hasn't killed books, televisions, or even the iPhone. The commercial hails the new Pro model as \"the most powerful iPad ever,\" but its bravado is mostly unearned. The iPad is, potentially, a creative tool. It's also an expensive luxury device whose cheaper iterations, at least, are vessels for letting your kid watch Cocomelon so they don't melt down in public, reading self-help books on a plane, or opting for more pixels and better resolution whilst consuming content on the toilet.\n\nIn the day and a half since the ad was released, people have only gotten angrier. Cook's tweet featuring the commercial has been viewed more than 29 million times, and the unhappy responses are piling up. Odds are, people aren't really furious at Apple on behalf of the trumpeters -- they're mad because the ad says something about the balance of power. Apple is a great technology company, but it is a legendary marketer. Its ads, slickly produced keynotes, and even its retail stores succeed because they offer a vision of the company's products as tools that give us, the consumers, power. The fundamental flaw of Apple's commercial is that it is a display of force that reminds us of this sleight of hand. We are not the powerful entity in this relationship. The creative potential we feel when we pick up one of their shiny devices is actually on loan. At the end of the day, it belongs to Apple, the destroyer.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_warzel@theatlantic.com", "name": "Charlie Warzel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "damon_beres@theatlantic.com", "name": "Damon Beres", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bust (sculpture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OENHhmLIGnGzjUzInDbZfz3ZIkA=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/05/apple_commercial/original.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Apple in the firing line over controversial iPad ad - TechCentral", "body": "Apple is facing unprecedented backlash over an advertisement for its new iPad Pro, in which a range of creative tools are crushed - and destroyed - by a giant compressor.\n\nThe ad, which featured in the video launch of the new iPad and was posted to social media by Apple CEO Tim Cook, is a slow-motion rendering showing musical instruments, cans of paint, a record player and other artistic tools overrun by the giant press as it bulldozes its way downward, smashing everything in its path.\n\nAfter the press closes - and following a brief pause for dramatic effect - it lifts to unveil the new iPad, suggesting the \"thinnest iPad ever\" houses all the crushed tools inside its svelte body.\n\nNamed \"Crush\" by Apple, the ad emphasises the thinness of the new iPad, a feature Apple's executives drove home when they unveiled the device. But some critics interpreted the ad as a symbol of the tech giant's power, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the threat it poses human labour and creativity. Others considered it simply to be in bad taste.\n\n\"Steve wouldn't have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch,\" Paul Graham, an early internet entrepreneur and founder of the Y Combinator start-up accelerator, tweeted in response to the ad.\n\nBut the backlash was not limited to tech luminaries. Celebrities also slammed Apple. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" tweeted Hugh Grant. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" tweeted Hugh Grant.\n\nThe creative faux pas may be a first for Apple, a company that has built a name for itself off the back of iconic advertising campaigns.\n\nIn the late 1990s, as the turn of the millennium was approaching, Apple ran a \"Think Different\" campaign that featured the likes of Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther King Junior and Muhamed Ali, cementing its identity as brand that champions radical individuality and the power of creativity.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic Apple advertisement is \"1984\", depicting Apple as a liberator, breaking the status quo and saving the world from the tyranny of ugly computers (made by then-rival IBM).\n\nThe table(t)s, it seems, have turned and many now see Apple's new ad as confirmation that the Cupertino, California electronics giant has morphed into the Big Brother it once mocked.\n\n\"Forty years ago, Apple released the 1984 commercial as a bold statement against a dystopian future. Now you are that dystopian future. Congratulations,\" X user Yuval Kordov said in reply to Tim Cook's post.\n\nSouth African advertising and marketing expert Jeremy Maggs said that when stacked up against the \"brand benchmark\" of the 1984 ad - which was directed by Ridley Scott - the Crush ad \"falls woefully short\".\n\n\"The essence of a good ad is simplicity. This one, I'm afraid, is busy and cluttered, and the reveal at the end is disappointing. I get the sense this is one of those commercials that needed multi-committee approval. If anything saves it, it's the soundtrack, but you can rarely go wrong with Cher,\" Maggs told TechCentral.\n\nJeremy Sampson, MD of Brand Finance Africa and an expert on brand management and marketing, is less critical of the ad, saying that \"sometimes all a brand needs is to freshen up and ignite some chatter\".\n\n\"I have been part of the Apple ecosystem for nearly 40 years, and it has served me well. Let's have this conversation again in a week or three and see the results. Apple is a giant among brands, and that won't change easily.\"\n\nThe Pro version of the latest iPad range features more powerful M4 chips, which Apple said enhances the device's artificial intelligence capabilities. Apple hopes the new iPads will revitalise its tablet business, which has suffered revenue declines in nine of the last 10 quarters. Apple's broader business has also suffered from slowing growth, although better-than-expected sales in China, one of its largest markets, bolstered investor sentiment when its released its quarterly

Posted on social media Tuesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ad starts off as a sort of time capsule for human creativity.\n\nThere's a metronome. A record player. Then the lights come on in a warehouse-like room, where you see those items and dozens of other creative tools sitting on a metal slab in the center of the shot. There's also a CRT TV, cans of paint, a globe of the Earth, a piano, an '80s arcade video game, a sculptural bust of a human head and a trumpet. Another giant metal slab hangs ominously above it all.\n\nAs we hear the opening words of \"All I Ever Need Is You,\" a 1972 single by Sonny & Cher, the metal slab starts descending.\n\nThe items are in a giant hydraulic press, and within about 40 seconds everything will be gone -- crushed under tons of force in an often dramatic fashion.\n\nAfter the destruction, the hydraulic press starts rising again. The debris is now gone. In its place is a shiny, new iPad Pro. A voiceover says, \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nCher closes out the minute-long spot, crooning \"All I ever need is you.\"\n\nVideos of hydraulic presses demolishing everything from electronics to candy have become very popular in the past few years, in part due to the often mesmerizing nature of the way things collapse under pressure.\n\nApple is seemingly trying to capitalize on this trend while making a point about how its new iPad Pro is so powerful it can replace other means of creative expression.\n\nBut for many viewers, the ad doesn't land the right note.\n\n\"I'm not sure 'wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is (sic) this world' was really the vibe you were trying for,\" says one commenter on X.\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" says another.\n\nCNN has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nOthers say that even though they understand what the ad is trying to say, it doesn't resonate with them.\n\n\"It's a creative concept & good execution, but wow the ad made me surprising (sic) sad!\" says one X user. \"The song choice also seems to especially idolize tech over real life. Now I just want to avoid screens & spend more time enjoying the world offline.\"\n\n\"It should have been about capturing and honoring the essence of what's so special about all of those things and experiences to bring them together in a device, not crushing the soul out of them,\" says another person on X.\n\nMany people agreed with this sentiment, saying the ad would have been better in reverse.\n\nThis isn't the first time an ad may not have landed the way a company expected -- think the infamous Peloton holiday ad or the Kendall Jenner ad for Pepsi. But with fears that AI could replace workers in many industries -- and the increasingly worrying research about how prolonged social media use affect us -- many consumers are growing wary of technology.\n\n\"This ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people think technology is killing everything we ever found joy in. And then presents that as a good thing,\" says a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. \"I haven't seen such a visceral backlash to a spot in a long time.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nUpdate, 1:50 p.m. PT, May 9: After a day of backlash, Apple has responded to the criticism over its Crush! ad, telling Ad Age in a statement that it \"missed the mark.\"\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Tor Myhren, Apple's vice president of marketing, told Ad Age in the statement. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nPrevious story as follows:\n\nApple debuted an ad for its new iPad Pro this week, seemingly meant to show the versatility and power of the product. It's getting backlash, however, from many in the creative community, who see it as an unfortunate metaphor for the crushing of human creativity.\n\nAfter announcing new products at its Let Loose event earlier this week, Apple aired the ad in question for its new flagship tablet, the seventh-generation iPad Pro. The \"Crush!\" ad depicts a room with a hydraulic press that slowly descends and crushes various artistic and creative equipment, including an arcade cabinet, a guitar, several DSLR cameras, and a bunch of painting tools, to name a few. After the machine flattened all that equipment, it disappeared and instead revealed the new iPad Pro tablet.\n\nThe ad's seemingly meant to highlight the product's versatility across art, gaming, music, and more. Plus, using a hydraulic press leans into the oddly satisfying video compilations that have made the rounds on TikTok and YouTube, which show hydraulic presses crushing everything from flowers to mugs to containers of marmalade.\n\nMany creative professionals, however, have interpreted it as a metaphor for using technology across various forms of creative-centric industries to replace jobs and displace human creators. Actor Hugh Grant called the ad the \"destruction of the human experience\" in a post on X/Twitter.\n\nActress and filmmaker Justine Bateman, meanwhile, wrote on X/Twitter that Apple's new ad \"crushes the arts,\" arguing that it hurts creators instead of supporting them. Luke Cage creator Cheo Hodari Coker noted said the ad was \"a problem\": \"Not in hip-hop 'bad meaning good' problem. But a problem problem.\"\n\nOthers have reflected that this contradicts Apple's previous stances and/or symbolic advertisement. Programmer Paul Graham replied to Cook's post, arguing that late Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs would have never shipped an ad like the Crush! one, claiming that \"would have pained [Jobs] too much to watch.\" Others called it \"antithetical\" to Ridley Scott's famous \"1984\" Apple MacIntosh Super Bowl ad, which showed its protagonist attempting to free her people from a Orwellian dystopia.\n\nThe ad comes at a time of tension between creative professionals and the tech industry, specifically regarding the use of artificial intelligence. Last year, Hollywood writers and actors went on strike, with protections against AI technology being one of their major priorities.\n\nThe gaming industry, which has already seen an unprecedented number of layoffs in the first five months of 2024 alone, is also having issues with ethically implementing artificial intelligence. Additionally, several writers and musicians have pursued legal action against tech companies like OpenAI and Nvidia for using their creative work for AI training without their consent.\n\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The ad was produced in-house by Apple's creative team, according to trade press reports.\n\nThe campaign has been hit by a wave of outrage, with responses on social media reacting to Cook's X post accusing Apple of crushing \"beautiful creative tools\" and the \"symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements.\"\n\nAdvertising industry executives argued the ad represented a mis-step for the Silicon Valley giant, which under late co-founder Steve Jobs was lauded for its ability to capture consumer attention through past campaigns.\n\nChristopher Slevin, creative director for marketing agency Inkling Culture, compared the iPad ad unfavorably to a famous Apple campaign directed by Ridley Scott called \"1984\" for the original Macintosh computer, which positioned Apple as liberating a dystopian, monochrome world.\n\n\"Apple's new iPad spot is essentially them turning into the thing they said they were out to destroy in the 1984 ad,\" said Slevin.\n\nActor Hugh Grant accused Apple of \"the destruction of the human experience courtesy of Silicon Valley\" on X.\n\nHowever, Richard Exon, founder of marketing agency Joint, said: \"A more important question is: does the ad do its job? It's memorable, distinctive, and I now know the new iPad has even more in it yet is thinner than ever.\"\n\nConsumer insights platform Zappi conducted consumer research on the ad that suggested that the idea of the hydraulic press crushing art was divisive.\n\nIt said that the ad underperformed benchmarks in typically sought-after emotions such as happiness and laughter and overperformed in traditionally negative emotions like shock and confusion, with older people more likely to have a negative response than younger consumers.\n\nNataly Kelly, chief marketing officer at Zappi, said: \"Is the Apple iPad ad a work of genius or the sign of the dystopian times? It really depends on how old you are.

Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant commented on X.\n\nProducer, director and writer Asif Kapadia wrote, \"Like iPads but don't know why anyone thought this ad was a good idea.

Now you get it, don't you?\n\nHere, you can check out the Apple 'Crush' advertisement video for yourself, which was posted by Apple CEO Tim Cook himself.\n\nRight off the bat, it's quite evident that this ad is distasteful. While the idea might have seemed innocent to the company, it describes everything that technology is taking away from us -- and it does so in a very harsh tone.\n\nAlso, it's quite surprising how no one inside Apple responsible for the advertisement had the common sense (or 'foresightedness' if you want to be polite) to see how the ad could have come across. An industrial press crushing musical instruments! Are you serious, Apple?\n\nIn the words of Hugh Grant, who recently joined the protest against this ad, it depicts \"The destruction of the human experience.\"\n\nKatie Deighton, a reporter from the Wall Street Journal shares similar sentiments. She said that Apple's ad reconfirms the belief that technology will eventually take away everything that makes us happy.\n\nHere's a glimpse at some of the many comments on X voicing their displeasure over the advertisement:\n\nMoreover, I think that at a time when there's already an increasing amount of fear among the masses about AI replacing jobs, this isn't the kind of message a company of Apple's stature should be sending out.\n\nOther notable personalities who spoke out include British filmmaker Asif Kapadia. He said that although he loves iPads, this ad was clearly a bad idea, and that it sheds light on the brutal reality of the tech industry and what it does to artists, writers, and creators -- they're used for their talent and creativity yet not compensated accordingly.\n\nFilmmaker and actor Justine Bateman directly commented on Cook's post saying, \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\" A short yet powerful message!\n\nWhat's particularly ironic is that the iPad Pro is meant to woo artists and creators -- and even they don't like the advertisement.\n\nAmerican cartoonist James Kochalka said that the ad is tone-deaf and insulting to artists, and although people like him are the target audience, demolishing the tools that artists love and respect is definitely not going to flatter them.\n\nAs was expected, Apple hasn't made any comments on the controversy. Perhaps the company believes in 'Bad publicity is good publicity if you're already public'?\n\nThe damage is already done, no doubt, but some netizens shared a few ideas of what the company could have done instead to get the same message across but without offending people.\n\nThe best one of the lot was by a Scott Wainner who wrote on X that the company could have captured the beauty of these everyday objects and how the iPad Pro brings these joyous experiences together on one platform.\n\nThis is a brilliant idea indeed! It's a shame that no one on Apple's team had this insight.\n\nTo conclude, I think that it's highly unlikely that the negative publicity is going to have any notable impact on the new iPads' popularity.

The ad was produced in-house by Apple's creative team, according to trade press reports.\n\nThe campaign has been hit by a wave of outrage, with responses on social media reacting to Cook's X post accusing Apple of crushing \"beautiful creative tools\" and the \"symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements\".\n\nAdvertising industry executives argued the ad represented a misstep for the Silicon Valley giant, which under late co-founder Steve Jobs was lauded for its ability to capture consumer attention through past campaigns.\n\nChristopher Slevin, creative director for marketing agency Inkling Culture, compared the iPad ad unfavourably to a famous Apple campaign directed by Ridley Scott called \"1984\" for the original Macintosh computer, which positioned Apple as liberating a dystopian, monochrome world.\n\n\"Apple's new iPad spot is essentially them turning into the thing they said they were out to destroy in the 1984 ad,\" said Slevin.\n\nActor Hugh Grant accused Apple of \"the destruction of the human experience courtesy of Silicon Valley\" on X.\n\nHowever, Richard Exon, founder of marketing agency Joint, said: \"A more important question is: does the ad do its job? It's memorable, distinctive and I now know the new iPad has even more in it yet is thinner than ever.\"\n\nConsumer insights platform Zappi conducted consumer research on the ad that suggested that the idea of the hydraulic press crushing art was divisive.\n\nIt said that the ad underperformed benchmarks in typically sought-after emotions such as happiness and laughter and overperformed in traditionally negative emotions like shock and confusion, with older people more likely to have a negative response than younger consumers.\n\nNataly Kelly, chief marketing officer at Zappi, said: \"Is the Apple iPad ad a work of genius or the sign of the dystopian times? It really depends on how old you are. The shock value is the power of this advert, which is controversial by design, so the fact that people are talking about it at all is a win.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macintosh 128K"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monochrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_marketing_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief marketing officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa7719c2b-630c-4b92-b8f3-f6d467e10b0f.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Similar videos now dominate TikTok feeds everywhere.)\n\nOnce the press has demolished the spread, it releases, and a glimmering new iPad appears, having replaced -- or made obsolete -- everything that came before it. All I Ever Need Is You by Cher and Sonny rings out.\n\nWATCH | The Apple ad upsetting artists:\n\nThe spot went viral as critics denounced its message. Some found it particularly hard to stomach the imagery of big tech crushing creative tools as artists grapple with the threats posed by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"This new ad by Apple perfectly depicts what Big Tech has sadly come to stand for: crushing human creativity in the name of technological innovation and selling it to us as progress,\" one X user wrote.\n\n\"It's tone-deaf at least, malicious at worst, in the current climate of [AI] replacing human arts.\"\n\nKrista Ball, an author in Edmonton who is also an Apple shareholder, said she watched the commercial and had a \"visceral, gross reaction -- almost the same way as you feel when you see a political ad that's really gross.\"\n\n\"The iPad does not replace the tools of pen and paper,\" Ball said in an interview with CBC News. \"Apple has always had this reputation of trying to work with art, to expand art, so to literally destroy art to say 'we're better,' that is not appealing to artists.\"\n\nApple has long been known for developing technology that complements creative work -- ranging from user-friendly tools like iMovie and GarageBand for editing film and audio, to professional tools such as Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro.\n\nIn a social media post introducing the commercial, Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to echo that message, writing of the new iPad, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nBut British actor Hugh Grant saw things differently. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" Grant wrote in response to Cook's post. American actress Justine Bateman put it bluntly, asking Cook: \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"\n\nFor many critics, the new Apple ad conjured unfavourable parallels to the tech company's famous 1984 ad by Blade Runner director Ridley Scott, which depicted a dystopian society ruled by a Big Brother-esque figure.\n\nAs the ruler speaks from a television to his entranced followers, a woman bounds toward the screen and smashes it with a sledgehammer.\n\n\"On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce MacIntosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984,\" a voiceover declared, referencing George Orwell's classic novel.\n\nWATCH | Ridley Scott's classic 1984 Apple commercial:\n\nAnneMarie Dorland, an assistant professor of marketing at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said that the 1984 ad \"taught people to feel that Apple was something rebellious.\"\n\nThe company's signature Mac Computer was \"different than the status quo or what you expected or what you already had,\" she said.\n\nThat vision of a new world is still present in the latest commercial, Dorland said -- but the messaging around the commercial, including its title \"Crush!\", was \"perhaps a misguided way of talking about it.\"\n\nIt did bring attention to what would have otherwise been an underwhelming update to one of the company's flagship products, she added. \"We're all still talking about the introduction of a slightly smaller iPad. So despite the controversy, it's working.\"\n\nShe noted that Apple just might be trying to reach a new audience \"who are getting access to some level of joy and creativity for the first time with some of these tools. So you could really make the argument, maybe, that Apple is just going after a new generation.\"\n\nIs Apple's reputation shifting?\n\nThom Binding, a marketing strategist in London, said he had a positive reaction to the ad -- but noted that the wider negative reaction to it speaks to how Apple's reputation has shifted.\n\n\"I think that in itself is quite alarming for Apple because they have shaped the brand around appealing to creatives,\" said Binding.\n\n\"Apple is sort of losing its relevance or its position within the culture and [with] creative people,\" Binding said. \"And that's something that's happening right now.

Not everyone appreciates the imagery, with critics hurling slams like \"tone deaf,\" \"ghoulish,\" \"heartbreaking\" and \"comically stupid\" Apple's way.\n\n\"Why did Apple do an ad that crushes the arts? Tech and AI means to destroy the arts and society in general,\" actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The ad comes as the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence prompts passionate responses among artists -- from excitement about its potential to steer art in weird and wonderful directions to fear it will steal jobs, and possibly change the very nature of creativity.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote in response to the ad. \"Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nApple released two new iPad Pros at its Tuesday \"Let Loose\" event, where it also unveiled two new iPad Airs and revamped Pencils and Magic Keyboards. It calls the iPad Pro the most powerful iPad yet, and the thinnest.\n\nThe device comes in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, with a new brighter screen, a new keyboard and a new Apple M4 chip that Apple says makes the device ready to handle the demands of AI. That the processor has arrived \"is Apple's way of saying how seriously it's taking both the iPad and AI,\" my Forbes colleague David Phelan writes.\n\nIt's clear from the ad Apple is touting the iPad Pro as a tool for artists. \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote when posting the ad on X. One of the ad's detractors countered, \"But the video shows a thousand beautiful things being destroyed.\"\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but given the sensitive climate around generative AI and art, it shouldn't be surprised at the pushback. In March, an AI-generated publicity image posted by an Australian symphony orchestra hit a sour note with creative professionals, and a metal band axed an AI-generated album cover following an outcry that it insulted flesh-and-blood artists.\n\nStill, the artistic community is far from monolithic. At a Wednesday event on art and AI at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, Hugh Leeman, an art lecturer at Duke University and Johns Hopkins, used the word bifurcation to describe how artists are talking about AI at this pivotal moment in its development and adoption. Leeman said people tend to view it as good or bad, black or white.\n\nWhile the ad could easily be interpreted as crushing the arts, it could also be seen as compressing a simulacrum of artistic tools into one device. Still, one displeased actor, writer and producer decided to create a new version of the ad.\n\n\"Here Apple, I fixed it for you,\" Reza Sixo Safai wrote alongside the reworked spot.

The ad remained viewable online as of this writing.\n\nThe roughly minute-long promo shows a hydraulic press crushing computers, musical instruments, an arcade cabinet, and even emoji. When the press lifts, all that's seen is the iPad Pro. The intent was to show how the new high-end tablet can handle many creative tasks despite being exceptionally thin.\n\nArtists, however, felt the ad was tone deaf. Actor Hugh Grant said it was a \"destruction of human experience,\" while The Handmaid's Tale series director Reed Morano called the promo \"psychotic.\" In general, the creative community has argued that the commercial devalued the 'analog' tools and experiences of their trade.\n\nThe iPad Pro ad and its fallout represent a rare misstep in Apple's marketing in the modern era. The company drew notoriety in 1985 when its \"Lemmings\" Super Bowl ad effectively insulted business customers by calling them blind followers who'd jump off a cliff. Some partly credit it with the turmoil that led to Steve Jobs' ouster from Apple.\n\nMany of Apple's other ad campaigns have been successes that helped define the brand, including its HAL 9000-inspired return to Super Bowl advertising, the iPod silhouette ads, and the \"there's an app for that\" iPhone spots.\n\nThe iPad Pro ad response is unlikely to significantly impact sales.

As is custom with such product announcements, various ads touting the latest ware is typical from Apple. Humans often hold art and the tools used to create very closely to their own sense of self, on a personal level.\n\nThat said, the \"Crush!\" iPad Pro ad that Apple released has rubbed many creatives, such as artists and musicians, the wrong way. In the ad, various creative tools familiar to artists are placed under a hydraulic press. Such hydraulic press videos have been popular on social media for years, crushing everything imaginable for the pure hedonistic glee of watching it happen.\n\nIf one plays devil's advocate, one can even argue the ad itself is successful. It brings attention to the iPad Pro, but it also forces us to question change and where art may head in the future. Is that not art itself?\n\nThere is something different about this Apple ad, however. Apple is a company closely tied to the folklore of the creative user base of consumers. Artists, musicians, video editors, and others have commonly turned to Apple products as a tool for art. It is understandable therefore how they can be upset when the tools of the trade are seemingly crushed to reveal the new iPad.", "source": {"uri": "hothardware.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotHardware"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thiago_trevisan@hothardware.com", "name": "Thiago Trevisan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Digital", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Digital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Net_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Net Art", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Clip_Art", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Clip Art", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64535/content/ipad-ad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

That was a mistake.\n\nApple has usually been successful at drumming up excitement for its new product launches. But that was not the case this week for its latest iPad Pro, which was unveiled in a characteristically sleek advertisement on Wednesday -- to extremely poor reception.\n\nThe ad shows a range of musical instruments, artworks, books, music players and toys all stacked on a platform as a giant hydraulic press slowly crushes the objects to the accompaniment of a jaunty Sonny & Cher song. At the end, nothing is left but the iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" the voiceover says.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook shared the video on X, writing: \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nBut the ad struck a nerve. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that such technology \"is just making some people insanely wealthy, at the expense of all of us.\" Actor Hugh Grant called it \"the destruction of the human experience.\" One X user wrote that the ad \"lacks respect for creative equipment and mocks creators.\"\n\nIn an environment where there are deep fears that AI and other tech advancements could replace human creativity, Apple managed to conceive the most apt metaphor for that process. It made a fundamental mistake here by quite literally showing its latest device rendering obsolete the various objects that people use to express thought and creativity. Instead, the ad seems to suggest, you can use a single digital product to replicate the creation of music, art and play for a mere $999.\n\nSure, you could say that people are overreacting to the video. After all, an ad -- no matter how poorly received or disastrous its metaphor -- is simply an ad. But Apple should probably have thought twice before serving up an image in which creative, cultural objects are literally obliterated and replaced with one of its products.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240508-new-ipad-ad-al-1045-e1cc85.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Similar videos now dominate TikTok feeds everywhere.)\n\nOnce the press has demolished the spread, it releases, and a glimmering new iPad appears, having replaced -- or made obsolete -- everything that came before it. All I Ever Need Is You by Cher and Sonny rings out.\n\nThe spot went viral as critics denounced its message. Some found it particularly hard to stomach the imagery of big tech crushing creative tools as artists grapple with the threats posed by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"This new ad by Apple perfectly depicts what Big Tech has sadly come to stand for: crushing human creativity in the name of technological innovation and selling it to us as progress,\" one X user wrote.\n\n\"It's tone-deaf at least, malicious at worst, in the current climate of [AI] replacing human arts.\"\n\nKrista Ball, an author in Edmonton who is also an Apple shareholder, said she watched the commercial and had a \"visceral, gross reaction -- almost the same way as you feel when you see a political ad that's really gross.\"\n\n\"The iPad does not replace the tools of pen and paper,\" Ball said in an interview with CBC News. \"Apple has always had this reputation of trying to work with art, to expand art, so to literally destroy art to say 'we're better,' that is not appealing to artists.\"\n\nApple has long been known for developing technology that complements creative work -- ranging from user-friendly tools like iMovie and GarageBand for editing film and audio, to professional tools such as Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro.\n\nIn a social media post introducing the commercial, Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to echo that message, writing of the new iPad, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nBut British actor Hugh Grant saw things differently. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" Grant wrote in response to Cook's post. American actress Justine Bateman put it bluntly, asking Cook: \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"\n\nCBC News has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nFor many critics, the new Apple ad conjured unfavourable parallels to the tech company's famous 1984 ad by Blade Runner director Ridley Scott, which depicted a dystopian society ruled by a Big Brother-esque figure.\n\nAs the ruler speaks from a television to his entranced followers, a woman bounds toward the screen and smashes it with a sledgehammer.\n\n\"On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce MacIntosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984,\" a voiceover declared, referencing George Orwell's classic novel.\n\nAnneMarie Dorland, an assistant professor of marketing at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said that the 1984 ad \"taught people to feel that Apple was something rebellious.\"\n\nThe company's signature Mac Computer was \"different than the status quo or what you expected or what you already had,\" she said.\n\nThat vision of a new world is still present in the latest commercial, Dorland said -- but the messaging around the commercial, including its title \"Crush!\", was \"perhaps a misguided way of talking about it.\"\n\nIt did bring attention to what would have otherwise been an underwhelming update to one of the company's flagship products, she added. \"We're all still talking about the introduction of a slightly smaller iPad. So despite the controversy, it's working.\"\n\nShe noted that Apple just might be trying to reach a new audience \"who are getting access to some level of joy and creativity for the first time with some of these tools. So you could really make the argument, maybe, that Apple is just going after a new generation.\"\n\nThom Binding, a marketing strategist in London, said he had a positive reaction to the ad -- but noted that the wider negative reaction to it speaks to how Apple's reputation has shifted.\n\n\"I think that in itself is quite alarming for Apple because they have shaped the brand around appealing to creatives,\" said Binding.\n\n\"Apple is sort of losing its relevance or its position within the culture and [with] creative people,\" Binding said. \"And that's something that's happening right now. It's something that's been going on probably in the last 10 years.\"\n\nHe pointed to Apple's dominance in the tech industry and its recent run-ins with antitrust regulators, including a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice that accuses Apple of engineering a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\n\"There is sort of an evolving sense that Apple's the bad guy, and it's not the friendly kind of creative, rebellious brand that we all remember it being,\" said Binding.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Typewriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logic Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Final Cut Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

The ad spot, \"Crush,\" depicts a giant pile of artistic instruments, tools, and ephemera being crushed by a hydraulic press, which then lifts back up to reveal the new iPad. The spot was meant to convey the fact that the new iPad Pro is Apple's thinnest product ever, but most viewers simply felt like Apple was attacking the very concept of creativity as they watched things like a piano, paint cans, and camera lenses get crushed by a giant machine.\n\nApple reversed course today, axing the ad entirely and issuing an unexpected apology after a massive online backlash and dozens of op-eds from major publications railed against the advertisement. In a statement to marketing trade Ad Age, Apple's VP of marketing communications, Tor Myhren, said, \"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nApologies from Apple are exceedingly rare, which only demonstrates just how furious people were with the misguided ad. In an era where AI threatens to erode creative professions, and tech feels more omnipresent than ever, it's easy to see how an ad like \"Crush\" was a tone-deaf way to promote the new iPad Pro, which seems like a great product on paper. It's a strange misstep from a company famed for its pristine advertisements, and however thin the iPad is, it seems the public's patience for tech shenanigans is even thinner.", "source": {"uri": "slashgear.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SlashGear"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ad Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/apple-axes-ipad-pro-crushed-advert-after-huge-creator-backlash/l-intro-1715292500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It's the hard lesson Apple learned after significant backlash over its new \"Crushed\" TV ad promoting the all-new iPad Pro and its revolutionary Tandem OLED screen technology. Now, the company has issued an apology and scrapped plans to run the ad on TV.\n\nIn the ad, a wide collection of creative tools, from guitars to cameras, paints, a metronome, sculptures, and even emojis, are violently crushed down in a giant press. When the creative violence is complete, the steel plates pull back to reveal a beautiful iPad Pro 13 in its place.\n\nThe idea is that all this creativity can be combined into this one M4-running iPad Pro. But that message is quickly lost as you bear witness to the destruction of precious objects.\n\nApple played the video for the first time at its \"Let Loose\" event on May 7. I recall sitting with about 40 people at one of Apple's New York offices and watching uncomfortably as the record player, guitar, TVs, and cameras all cracked, flattened, and sometimes exploded. My rational brain understood the point but my emotional one was disturbed and I barely noticed the iPad Pro at the end of it.\n\nI was not the only one who felt this way and now Apple is responding.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple's VP of Marketing Communications Tor Myhren told Ad Age it would not air the ad on TV (it's still at this writing on YouTube), adding, \"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nApple doesn't offer a lot of apologies. Steve Jobs famously told iPhone 4 owners who were experiencing connectivity issues that they were \"holding it wrong.\" This, though, is no longer Job's Apple. Apple CEO Tim Cook seems more open to regrets.\n\nIt's not the first time, by the way, we've seen this bad idea. As The Verge pointed out in its coverage, 15 years ago LG produced an ad almost identical to Apple's concept: An enclosure full of creative objects (paint and a violin, for instance), and all of it crushed down to one of LG's latest phones. The similarities are stunning.\n\nWe can mark this as a rare misstep for the protean tech giant, and it's unlikely to distract from the startling innovation we witnessed on May 7. As my iPad Pro 13-inch hands-on notes: \"Apple's iPad Pro experience now feels more premium than ever, with the 2024 model boasting almost shocking thinness, intriguing new power thanks to a new M4 chip, and dual-OLED-panel screen technology that offers stunning image quality, with near plasma-screen-level blacks.\"", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_ulanoff@techradar.com", "name": "Lance Ulanoff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metronome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ad Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5SbriNa4xF8aQR39YxCFa-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 853, "textEnd": 858, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

My god.\"\n\nMany commentators were surprised that Apple seemed so out-of-touch with the current cultural climate.\n\nIn the past, Apple has presented itself as a hip, counter-cultural corporation, a company that appeals to working creatives by making sleek, user-friendly tools.\n\nApple's controversial ad marked a stark contrast to the company's famous \"1984\" ad, directed by Ridley Scott, which successfully framed the Macintosh computer as a liberating tool against bland, corporate monoculture.\n\nOne commentator wrote: \"Forty years ago, Apple released the 1984 commercial as a bold statement against a dystopian future. Now you are that dystopian future. Congratulations.\"\n\nThe ad seemed particularly tasteless in the context of the turmoil of the entertainment industry, with Hollywood recently rocked by strikes that were partially motivated by the use of generative AI in film production, among other significant issues.\n\nOn X, actor Hugh Grant described the ad as \"The destruction of the human experience.\"\n\nDirector and writer Asif Kapadia wrote, \"Like iPads but don't know why anyone thought this ad was a good idea. It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to the arts, to artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it's all created by them.\"\n\nSome even edited the ad to play in reverse, creating a surprisingly moving depiction of flourishing human creativity, pushing back against the might of Silicon Valley.\n\nIt seems that the honeymoon period for generative AI has passed; for many, the initial wave of optimism has been replaced by anxiety, as the negative impact of the technology becomes increasingly obvious.\n\nAI-generated content is currently spreading like wildfire through social media, spewing misinformation, spam, bizarre imagery, and non-consensual pornography.\n\nGenerative AI even proved a sore point in the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef, with one of Drake's diss tracks featuring a digital imitation of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, prompting Shakur's estate to threaten legal action.\n\nAI even impacted the Met Gala discourse, with AI-generated fakes tricking many social media users into believing that Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna had attended the event.\n\nIn the novel 1984, George Orwell memorably described his fascist dystopia as \"a boot stamping on a human face -- forever.\"\n\nWith the new iPad Pro ad, Apple unintentionally created a metaphor for AI-skeptics -- a hydraulic press, crushing the spirit of human creativity.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's getting backlash, however, from many in the creative community, who see it as an unfortunate metaphor for the crushing of human creativity.\n\nAfter announcing new products at its Let Loose event earlier this week, Apple aired the ad in question for its new flagship tablet, the seventh-generation iPad Pro. The \"Crush!\" ad depicts a room with a hydraulic press that slowly descends and crushes various artistic and creative equipment, including an arcade cabinet, a guitar, several DSLR cameras, and a bunch of painting tools, to name a few. After the machine flattened all that equipment, it disappeared and instead revealed the new iPad Pro tablet.\n\nThe ad's seemingly meant to highlight the product's versatility across art, gaming, music, and more. Plus, using a hydraulic press leans into the oddly satisfying video compilations that have made the rounds on TikTok and YouTube, which show hydraulic presses crushing everything from flowers to mugs to containers of marmalade.\n\nMany creative professionals, however, have interpreted it as a metaphor for using technology across various forms of creative-centric industries to replace jobs and displace human creators. Actor Hugh Grant called the ad the \"destruction of the human experience\" in a post on X/Twitter.\n\nActress and filmmaker Justine Bateman, meanwhile, wrote on X/Twitter that Apple's new ad \"crushes the arts,\" arguing that it hurts creators instead of supporting them. Luke Cage creator Cheo Hodari Coker noted said the ad was \"a problem\": \"Not in hip-hop 'bad meaning good' problem. But a problem problem.\"\n\nOthers have reflected that this contradicts Apple's previous stances and/or symbolic advertisement. Programmer Paul Graham replied to Cook's post, arguing that late Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs would have never shipped an ad like the Crush! one, claiming that \"would have pained [Jobs] too much to watch.\" Others called it \"antithetical\" to Ridley Scott's famous \"1984\" Apple MacIntosh Super Bowl ad, which showed its protagonist attempting to free her people from a Orwellian dystopia.\n\nThe ad comes at a time of tension between creative professionals and the tech industry, specifically regarding the use of artificial intelligence.

A voiceover then states: \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nThe implication that an iPad can squeeze humanity's cultural prowess into an object with a depth of 5mm was viewed differently by commentators on social media. The actor Hugh Grant wrote on X that the advert represented \"the destruction of the human experience, courtesy of Silicon Valley\".\n\nJustine Bateman, a US film-maker who has criticised the impact of artificial intelligence on her industry, wrote on X: \"Why did Apple do an ad that crushes the arts? Tech and AI means to destroy the arts and society in general.\"\n\nUnfavourable comparisons were also made with Ridley Scott's 1984 Apple Macintosh ad, which portrayed an Orwellian future being challenged by a sledge hammer-wielding heroine and had the tagline \"you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'.\"\n\nChristopher Slevin, creative director of the UK marketing agency Inkling Culture, wrote on LinkedIn: \"It looks like Apple has become Big Brother itself, subtly shaping our digital lives in ways we may not fully grasp or choose to ignore. The new iPad Pro ad, while stunning, hints at a future where our creativity is confined to digital screens, and all physicality is crushed beneath the relentless march of technology.\"\n\nPaul Graham, a Silicon Valley investor, wrote on X that the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs \"wouldn't have shipped that ad\".

The new iPad Pro.\"\n\nObviously, this ad generated a whole host of criticisms for a variety of reasons.\n\nByron York, political correspondent for the Washington Examiner, simply stated that the ad was \"really horrible ... horrifying, actually.\"\n\nGaming website Kotaku noted that Apple was clearly piggy-backing off viral TikTok videos of things getting crushed in a hydraulic press, but the sheer amount of materials destroyed in the ad sparked outcries about the massive waste on display.\n\nBut, more so than the waste, people were much more disturbed by the underlying philosophical implications of the ad.\n\nThis ad was disturbing mostly because it seemed to suggest that every element of human existence can, should, and will be distilled down into a tiny device with a screen.\n\nWhich is, fundamentally, a repugnant idea that must be resisted as much as possible.\n\nAs user Judd Barroff wrote, \"I'm not sure 'wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is this world' was really the vibe you were trying for,\" while user Jash Dohlani bemoaned how the ad implied that \"A silicon slab (and Tim Cook) will permanently stand between u and the world.\"\n\nAnd, though user Sterling Crispin said in the comments that he was mostly joking, his joke probably best encapsulated the disturbing trans-humanism undergirding the whole ad.\n\nIn Crispin's words \"Maybe for the next Apple Watch Pro you should crush sports equipment, show a robot running faster than a man, then turn to the camera and say, 'God is dead and we have killed him.'\"\n\nNow, again, Crispin was speaking in a tongue-in-cheek, hyperbolic fashion, but he was on to something.\n\nTechnology, of course, is not evil in itself.\n\nTechnology is a tool, and, like any tool, it can be used for purposes good and evil.\n\nHowever, turning literally every aspect of the human experience into something digital would be a sinister purpose indeed.\n\nGod created humans as soul and body for a reason -- God desired us to interact with his creation, not solely through an artificial intermediary, not solely through our intellect, but also through our physical senses.\n\nPlaying an instrument, painting, listening to a record, sculpting, or any other endeavor wantonly destroyed in this ad could not and cannot be replicated on an iPad, no matter what Apple wants us to think.\n\nThat Apple might want to help create a world where physical mediums and tools become obsolete and every experience is mediated through a digital interface is a frightening thought.\n\nWhat is a Utopian dream for the liberal elites is a dystopian nightmare for everyone else.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"},

But, as it turns out, Apple isn't the first to use this concept - LG did it back in 2008.\n\nIn Apple's new ad for the latest generation of iPad Pro, the company shows various instruments, camera parts, paints, and much more being crushed by a hydraulic press. At the end, the super-thin new iPad Pro is revealed.\n\nThe idea behind the ad is pretty clear - Apple's powerful new tablet can, to an extent, \"replace\" all of these other devices and tools. But the ad has come under fire from creatives and more. Why? It was well-put by filmmaker Asif Kapadia who said in a post on Twitter/X:\n\nIt is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to the arts, to artists musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it's all created by them.\n\n9to5Mac captured more examples of the backlash, including the clever idea to just run the ad in reverse, making it look like all of these creative tools are coming out of the iPad's thin body.\n\nBut, ironically, the ad itself looks a whole lot like a 2008 ad for the LG Renoir KC910. That device pre-dates the company's first Android phone but packed an 8MP camera, MP3 player, and more, which, at the time, was a pretty big deal. To showcase that, an ad from LG showed musical instruments, camera lenses, paint, and more being crushed in a hydraulic press before revealing the phone itself.\n\nIt's pretty crazy how well the two ads align, even showing the same shot of the press making the glass in the camera lenses explode. The ad was highlighted by Andy Allen on Twitter/X, but is also still posted to one of LG's YouTube channels.\n\nDid Apple copy LG's concept? It's impossible to say for certain, but it's certainly ironic at the very least. But LG, back in 2008, likely never saw the same level of backlash, probably in large part because that device wasn't touting itself as a creative replacement for these various tools, and 2008 was also well before AI and the digital landscape as a whole threatened many creative roles.", "source": {"uri": "9to5google.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Google"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_schoon@9to5google.com", "name": "Ben Schoon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Allen_(chef)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Allen (chef)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portable media player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/lg-crush-ad-2008-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

From killing the headphone jack to embracing the 60Hz refresh rate on many of its flagship devices -- the company is no stranger to questionable decisions. Its latest oopsie comes in the form of a controversial iPad Pro M4 ad, which has triggered people across the internet.\n\nTitled Crush!, the advertisement features paint buckets, a piano, a retro arcade game, and other old-school artistic equipment being crushed by a hydraulic press. The iPad Pro M4 then emerges, symbolizing how it can handle a wide range of creative and entertainment tasks -- despite its competitively slim design.\n\nThis execution has naturally triggered people, especially creators who have been particularly struggling in recent times. With the ongoing AI boom, many have lost their jobs and are struggling to fit into the evolving art market. Having a lifeless weight completely crush these people's tools, only for a machine to emerge, strongly resembles the era we live in.\n\nIn Apple's defense, some users have speculated that the new video is a bookend to the iconic 1984 ad. In the original advertisement, a radiant person destroys the machine in a dull, dystopian setting. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro ad inverts the factors and has the machine crush the vibrant art equipment.\n\nPersonally, when I first saw the iPad Pro ad, I didn't really overanalyze it. It's a compelling statement that, by design, is meant to reflect how powerful the new iPad is. The raw imagery is there to trigger a reaction in the viewer. However, after reading some of the replies to Tim Cook's tweet, I can now see how distasteful this ad may seem.\n\nWhat do you think about the controversial iPad Pro ad?

It's getting backlash, however, from many in the creative community, who see it as an unfortunate metaphor for the crushing of human creativity.\n\nAfter announcing new products at its Let Loose event earlier this week, Apple aired the ad in question for its new flagship tablet, the seventh-generation iPad Pro. The \"Crush!\" ad depicts a room with a hydraulic press that slowly descends and crushes various artistic and creative equipment, including an arcade cabinet, a guitar, several DSLR cameras, and a bunch of painting tools, to name a few. After the machine flattened all that equipment, it disappeared and instead revealed the new iPad Pro tablet.\n\nThe ad's seemingly meant to highlight the product's versatility across art, gaming, music, and more. Plus, using a hydraulic press leans into the oddly satisfying video compilations that have made the rounds on TikTok and YouTube, which show hydraulic presses crushing everything from flowers to mugs to containers of marmalade.\n\nMany creative professionals, however, have interpreted it as a metaphor for using technology across various forms of creative-centric industries to replace jobs and displace human creators. Actor Hugh Grant called the ad the \"destruction of the human experience\" in a post on X/Twitter.\n\nActress and filmmaker Justine Bateman, meanwhile, wrote on X/Twitter that Apple's new ad \"crushes the arts,\" arguing that it hurts creators instead of supporting them. Luke Cage creator Cheo Hodari Coker noted said the ad was \"a problem\": \"Not in hip-hop 'bad meaning good' problem. But a problem problem.\"\n\nOthers have reflected that this contradicts Apple's previous stances and/or symbolic advertisement. Programmer Paul Graham replied to Cook's post, arguing that late Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs would have never shipped an ad like the Crush! one, claiming that \"would have pained [Jobs] too much to watch.\" Others called it \"antithetical\" to Ridley Scott's famous \"1984\" Apple MacIntosh Super Bowl ad, which showed its protagonist attempting to free her people from a Orwellian dystopia.\n\nThe ad comes at a time of tension between creative professionals and the tech industry, specifically regarding the use of artificial intelligence. Last year, Hollywood writers and actors went on strike, with protections against AI technology being one of their major priorities.\n\nThe gaming industry, which has already seen an unprecedented number of layoffs in the first five months of 2024 alone, is also having issues with ethically implementing artificial intelligence. Additionally, several writers and musicians have pursued legal action against tech companies like OpenAI and Nvidia for using their creative work for AI training without their consent.\n\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The ad, set to the upbeat tune of Sonny & Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You,\" features an industrial-sized hydraulic press crushing various objects associated with human creativity, such as books, musical instruments, and art supplies, to reveal the new ultra-thin iPad Pro.\n\nThough the internet did not seem to like the ad as much as the new iPad, social media users have criticized it, claiming it is \"destructive\" and \"crushing symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements to appeal to pro creators.\"\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook shared the ad on X (formerly Twitter), writing, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create,\" and many were quick to express their distaste for the ad.\n\nA user on X posted, \"This ad is (unintentional) perfect metaphor for today's creative dark age: compress organic instruments, joyful/imperfect machines, tangible art, our entire physical reality into a soulless, postmodern, read-only device a multi-trillion $ corporation controls what you do with.\"\n\n\"I felt sad when I saw creative tools such as musical instruments and cameras being destroyed. I don't think the creators will like this video,\" wrote another user on X.\n\nAnother wrote, \"Can't believe Apple ran such an out of touch commercial that treats devices Steve Jobs would have cherished as trash.\"\n\nSome users compared the new ad to Apple's iconic \"1984\" commercial, which depicted the company as a rebel against conformity. One of them wrote, \"1984: Monochrome, conformist, industrial world exploded by colourful, vibrant human. 2024: Colourful, vibrant humanity is crushed by monochrome, conformist industrial press.\"Another X user added, \"Forty years ago, Apple released the 1984 commercial as a bold statement against a dystopian future.

And nowhere is this more apparent than in its latest advert, plugging the new \u00a31,299 ($1,617) iPad Pro. The one-minute clip shows a collection of artistic objects - including paints, books and musical instruments - being crushed by an industrial press. But the 'tasteless' and 'insulting' ad has been widely slammed online, including by English actor Hugh Grant.\n\nThe Love Actually star posted on X (formerly Twitter ): 'The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.' Someone replied to Grant, adding 'And the destruction of childhood', to which the actor replied, 'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I could go on.'\n\nIn the ad - which was originally posted to X by Apple CEO Tim Cook - the artistic objects are slowly turned to bits by the metal press as 'All I Ever Need is You' by Sonny and Cher plays. When the press lifts up again, the pulverized remains have vanished and the new iPad Pro appears instead. It seems the collection of objects is supposed to represent everything that the new iPad is capable of - from sketching art to playing music and displaying documents.\n\nIt's also meant to highlight the tablet as the thinnest product Apple has ever made - although, ironically, at 5.1mm (0.2 inch), it would be destroyed by the industrial press too. Unfortunately, artists are considering the suggestion that an Apple product could replace all of their tools as 'insulting'. One furious X user called it 'an absolutely tone-deaf and insulting ad'.\n\nHe said: 'The visual messaging is terrible Like who thought literally CRUSHING THE ARTS AND THEIR TOOLS was the move to make to market this towards creatives?' Another X user posted: 'With all the Apple tech knowhow, if you really insisted on producing such a tasteless advert, you could have used cgi [computer generated imagery]. The fact that you chose to destroy things that could have been used by properly talented people speaks volumes about you, your company, and the state of things.' Another posted: 'Ah, Apple providing the perfect metaphor for what's happening to the creative arts & humanities, and then mistakenly thinking it's a good look for an advert.'\n\nSomeone else reversed the advert, showing the iPad being crushed and the objects appearing in its place, saying they'd 'fixed it'. Other users figured that the controversy generated by the advert would simply help Apple sell its products. Forty years ago, Apple was responsible for what's been described as one of the greatest commercials, called '1984', directed by Ridley Scott. The ad - plugging the original Apple Macintosh computer - portrays a dystopian setting influenced by George Orwell's famous book where humanity is saved from 'conformity'.\n\nChristopher Slevin, creative director for marketing agency Inkling Culture, said the message of the new ad is effectively the opposite. 'Apple's new iPad spot is essentially them turning into the thing they said they were out to destroy in the 1984 ad,' he wrote on LinkedIn. James Bore, tech expert at consultancy Bores Group, said Apple 'completely missed the mark'. 'I think they may have alienated a not-insignificant part of their target market by thinking like technologists rather than creatives,' he told MailOnline.\n\n'It kind of shows how disconnected they are from actual creative efforts. There were much better ways to create the same message, without destroying things that their customers will feel sentimental about for a publicity stunt. Unless of course they were going deliberately for the controversy sells angle, which I can't rule out entirely.' It's unclear how much Apple spent on the advert; MailOnline has contacted the tech giant for more information. Apple unveiled the iPad Pro along with a slightly cheaper iPad Air and an Apple Pencil at an unveiling event on Tuesday . However, people were left asking 'who still buys iPads', as the line only makes up around 6 per cent of the company's sales.\n\nAside from its extra-thin profile, the new iPad Pro is fasters due to a new AI-focused M4 chip with a larger 'neural engine' that can complete 38 trillion tasks per second. The \u00a3799 ($995) iPad Air is equipped with the less-capable M2 chip, but both iPads come in two screen sizes - 11 inches and 13 inches. The Magic Pencil, Apple's \u00a3129 ($160) stylus, also gets haptic controls in the form of a 'squeeze function' and the ability to roll the pencil to change brush shapes.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Courtesy of Silicon Valley.'\n\nOn X, English actor Hugh Grant posted: 'The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley'\n\nSomeone replied to Grant adding 'And the destruction of childhood', to which the actor replied, 'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

The latest iPad Pro stole the show when Apple said it measures just 5.1 millimeters thick - thinner than the iPod Nano (left)\n\nApple unveiled the iPad Pro along with a slightly cheaper iPad Air and an Apple Pencil at an unveiling event on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, people were left asking 'who still buys iPads', as the line only makes up around 6 per cent of the company's sales.\n\nAside from its extra-thin profile, the new iPad Pro is fasters due to a new AI-focused M4 chip with a larger 'neural engine' that can complete 38 trillion tasks per second.\n\nThe \u00a3799 iPad Air is equipped with the less-capable M2 chip, but both iPads come in two screen sizes - 11 inches and 13 inches.\n\nThe Magic Pencil, Apple's \u00a3129 ($129) stylus, also gets haptic controls in the form of a 'squeeze function' and the ability to roll the pencil to change brush shapes.\n\nTHE TRILLION DOLLAR RISE OF APPLE\n\n1976: Founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne created the company on April 1 1976 as they set about selling computer kits to hobbyists, each of which was built by Wozniak.\n\nThe first product was the Apple I.\n\n1977: Apple released the Apple II in June, which was the first PC made for the mass market.\n\nSteve Jobs unveils Apple Computer Corporation's new Macintosh February 6, 1984 in California.\n\n1981: Jobs became chairman.\n\n1984: The Macintosh was introduced during an ad break for the Super Bowl and later officially unveiled during a launch event.

Rather than 'look how thin we made all this stuff,' many saw the destruction of instruments and art supplies as disrespectful to artists and their crafts at best, and at worst, unintentional evidence of Apple's true ambitions to optimize the arts into a smooth colorless paste, or perhaps an ode to anti-creative forces like generative AI.\n\nMy favorite objection to the ad, just as a piece of writing, came from former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who worked at Valve for a time. Sounding like an RPG character urging the hero to action, Varoufakis wrote on X: \"Tim Cook has just revealed his techno-feudal urge to crush everything of cultural value in his quest for power. It is time for humanity to reprimand him. To boycott this rotten Apple. Starting with the new iPad, the birth of which Cook chose to announce in this grotesque manner.\"\n\nPersonally, I think Apple meant to show that the iPad Pro is thin, and for whatever reason failed to realize that crushing stuff people like would upset them. But whether it was a simple blunder or a glimpse at behind-the-scenes \"Saturn Devouring His Son\" vibes at Apple, the ad is now toast.\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Apple VP of marketing communications Tor Myhren told AdAge. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nAccording to AdAge, the ad won't be aired on television as previously planned.\n\nAside from making computers you can't repair, Apple has gained a reputation for running iconic ads, including its famous Ridley Scott-directed \"1984\" ad, the dancing iPod silhouettes, and its Mac vs PC campaign. Here's another for the list, and although it'll go down as more infamous than famous, I can't say I'm not aware that the new iPad Pro is thin.

Then why not treat yourself to a viewing of Apple's new iPad Pro ad, titled \"Crush!\"?\n\nThis isn't just a bad ad; it's outright difficult to watch. Who wants to see a trumpet, an arcade machine, a piano, and multiple other outlets of human expression get squished into nothingness and replaced with an iPad? Why is there a cute little cartoon critter in there getting squashed with everything else?! And above all, why did Apple think this was a good idea when people are worried enough already about human endeavors slowly being replaced with technology -- namely sinister generative AI tools?\n\nThe reaction to the ad has been overwhelmingly negative, with people coming out to express the horror they felt while watching the ad. Actor Hugh Grant, just one of many people to speak out about the ad's unpleasantness, called it, \"The destruction of the human experience.\"\n\nOther creatives were equally outraged. Artist James Kochalka said, \"I'm definitely the target audience for the new iPad Pro but this ad is tone-deaf and insulting to artists of every kind. We think of our tools with reverence and respect, and enjoy a healthy dialogue with them. Our tools are like trusted companions on the journey of art.\"\n\nAn iPad, even a shiny new 13-inch one, simply cannot replace human tools and people are not impressed by the implication that they can. As good as an iPad made be at helping a person make music, it's not a replacement for a real trumpet or piano. And users of X, formerly known as Twitter, have made that very clear in their posts.\n\nIt's also fair to say that the iPad ad isn't the worst thing going on in the world right now, and it's arguably not the worst ad in even recent history. (For my money, that award goes to Kendall Jenner's unbelievably tone-deaf \"protest\" Pepsi ad.) But \"Crush!\" features as its \"main character\" a little yellow emoji ball with googly eyes being crushed under the weight of technology, and too many people right now feel just like that poor yellow ball.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_barrett@themarysue.com", "name": "Sarah Barrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade cabinet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kochalka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Kochalka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_audience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target audience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Apple-Ipad-Ad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

On X, for instance, Apple chief Tim Cook's post sharing the ad has been flooded with criticism.\n\nOne commenter said the ad ironically served as a representation of how tech giants are squashing human creativity with AI. At the same time, Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham suggested Steve Jobs never would have okayed the ad on his watch.\n\nBut it turns out, the ad wasn't even an original idea.\n\nFifteen years ago, Korean electronics company LG used almost exactly the same concept in a UK spot for its Renoir camera phone.\n\nIn that ad, musical instruments, computer monitors, studio lights, and paints are all crushed in a press -- revealing the sleekly intact Renoir in conclusion.\n\nOf course, there's no evidence Apple -- known for its unique marketing prowess -- copied LG's creative. It's more likely that the concept of crushing a bunch of different devices down into one product is a bit basic.\n\nIt's also safe to say that back in 2008 -- when technology felt more like a galvanizing opportunity than a looming threat -- the ad didn't ignite nearly the same firestorm.\n\nSome YouTube commenters of yesteryear even seemed to really to like it.\n\n\"Love this advert for some relly wierd reason,\" one viewer wrote in 2008.\n\nAnother added at the time: \"Anyone who has this phone, is really that good or just an excellent ad?\n\nNeither LG nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_weiss@businessinsider.in", "name": "Geoff Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Graham (programmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109989794/apples-bad-ad-wasnt-even-an-original-idea.jpg?imgsize=93382", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

These include musical instruments, toys, paint cans, a sculpture, and many others - all of which are later crushed, only to reveal the new, slimmer iPad Pro at the end.\n\nSocial media users immediately criticised the ad as painfully tone-deaf, especially with the emergence of generative AI, which is causing concern in the creative community. Many lamented the destruction of cultural tools for the purpose of introducing a supposedly do-it-all digital device.\n\nCelebrities also shared the same sentiment, with actor Hugh Grant describing the ad as \"The destruction of the human experience.\" Nothing CEO Carl Pei chimed in as well, simply replying \"Yikes\" to Tim Cook's post which shared the video on X.\n\nApple has yet to comment regarding this matter.

Offended consumers reversed the ad to make it a less 'horrific corporate nightmare'", "body": "Apple tried tapping into TikTok users' unique fascination with watching things get crushed-so satisfying-as an advertisement strategy for its newest iPad Pro.\n\nViewers of the ad, though have a different opinion: Vanquishing the hand-held tools of art and creativity, like musical instruments, paints and styluses as well as antique arcade games and cameras with a hydraulic press, and insisting its thinnest iPad ever could weather such destruction, is a story of \"anti-humanity destruction.\" It is not, as Apple appears to have intended, a breakthrough that will eliminate the need for mixed mediums. In a reversal, artists offended by the ad noticed that playing the video backward would show the creative tools escaping the destruction of the hydraulic press, and declared the new series of images a \"less heartbreaking\" symbol of the triumph of art over technology.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook posted the ad to X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday, writing \"Meet the new iPad Pro, the thinnest product we've ever created,\" adding, \"just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\" That message seemed to strike a different chord with viewers and longtime customers of the tech giant, many of whom criticized how \"the video shows a thousand beautiful things being destroyed,\" and the \"symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools\" in the ad.\n\nTo be sure, the ad has spurred a lot of rage. \"This ad effectively convinced me I need less technology in my life,\" one user posted on X. Another user, Hiroki Akiyama, who works as the chief technology officer at search platform for customer support Helpfeel, wrote \"it is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement,\" adding that \"when I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.\"\n\nThe ad has especially angered a lot of Japanese creatives, according to a thread of responses to Cook's post of the ad on X. One user wrote he felt sad seeing creative tools being destroyed, stating \"I don't think the creators will like this video. Is it my Japanese sensibility that makes me feel this way?\"\n\nMany other Japanese creators chimed in with their discontent about the ad's insensitivity, as one user wrote: \"In Japan, one of the meaningful markets for your company, I believe that many sensitive people were hurt by the advertising expression. I am a long time fan of the iPad Pro, but this is too sad [an] image.\" Another wrote, \"many craftsmen value their tools,\" and the video, which presents tools of many creative industries all pulverized together, \"will only disgust them.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment deeply rooted in a growing fear of how advanced technology and AI will impact, or even hijack the market for creatives, especially those who depend on the success of their creativity to earn a living.\n\nMany professional artists have spoken up about the harms they've experienced due to the proliferation of AI-or more importantly, the lack of regulation over the technology. Those harms include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement, according to a study that measured the impact of AI art on artists.\n\nAI, which uses machine learning-based image generators with an ability to \"output consistently higher quality images,\" has been capturing the nation's attention for the last several years, with its ability to easily recreate photos into pretty much anything. Your selfie can easily be transformed into an air-brushed goddess version of you, or recreated in the painting style of Van Gogh. In fact, generative AI art is an estimated $48 billion industry, the study found.\n\nIt's important to note for AI to transform you, it first needs to input material into its learning model, and such material is often made by humans. As it turns out, that's one of the very areas artists are concerned about.\n\nWhile artists hone their craft over years of practice, often spending time and money on schooling, supplies, books, and tutorials, the study found, AI companies are \"using their works without compensation while raising billions from venture capitalists to compete with them in the same market.\" The inherent inequality of this relationship, the study states, means that power over how generative AI operates could end up centralized in the hands of a few corporations in Western nations, \"while disenfranchising artists around the world.\"\n\nAccording to 2022 data from the U.S Census Bureau, about 2.6 million Americans are employed as artists, which the federal government defines by a handful of occupations, including architects, fine artists, animators, designers, actors, dancers, photographers, and others. The unemployment rate for artists in 2022 was 3.9%, up from 3.7% in 2019-and is relatively higher than other professional workers who generally require college training, which has an unemployment rate of about 2%.\n\nTo be sure, these concerns are just some of the reasons people might not be too quick to enjoy an advertisement that insists the nuances of historic human creativity can be accomplished on Apple's latest iPad.\n\nSome particularly offended viewers of the ad have edited the video to play in reverse, which depicts the creative tools essentially being freed from the destructive grasp of the hydraulic press. Users on X wrote that reversing the ad makes it \"less of a horrific corporate nightmare,\" and many herald that version as an improvement over the original.\n\nOn X, one user wrote, \"honestly, they should just say 'whoops' and release a new ad which is the exact same video played backwards.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stylus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chord (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vincent van Gogh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2077025425-e1715281317690.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Actor Hugh Grant described it as \"the destruction of the human experience,\" while actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman questioned Apple's motives saying, \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l63720240509130601.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Register by May 13 to save 35%.\n\nIt was supposed to be a clever product demonstration for Apple's latest sleek, AI-powered iPad. But the brand, typically praised for its advertising, has sparked a wave of backlash for a commercial that crushes and destroys creative tools.\n\nIn just a couple of days since its release, Apple's \"Crush\" has become one of the most controversial and debated recent ads. Critics have called it \"soul-crushing,\" \"disgusting\" and \"destructive.\"\n\nEven Hollywood royalty, British actor Hugh Grant, weighed in on the spot, posting on X: \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"Crush\" promotes Apple's \"thinnest product ever,\" the 13-inch iPad Pro, by highlighting what users can do with the tablet's apps, such as editing films or creating digital artwork. In the spot, developed in-house, a hydraulic press flattens objects including a piano, guitar, books, paint cans, cameras and a sculpture. When the carnage ends, the crusher lifts to reveal an iPad Pro.\n\nApple is adept at using human stories and craft to demonstrate its products, and many of those ads have won industry awards. But at a time when many creative people are skeptical or fearful of how technology may jeopardize their professions, this one hit differently.\n\n\"Given Apple's market and cultural domination, the semiotics of crushing beautiful and inspiring creative tools seems insensitive and gives easy ammunition to the haters,\" said Ian Heartfield, co-founder and chief creative officer of agency New Commercial Arts.\n\nThis isn't about creative conjecture either, consumers were equally shocked, surprised and confused by Apple's execution, per data from consumer sentiment business Zappi. The company gauged emotional reactions to the spot and found it over-indexed on all three feelings. The ad made just 26.7% of consumers feel happy, against a benchmark average of 36%.\n\nIn the U.S., one in five consumers said they thought the ad portrayed content that people could find offensive. Despite this, younger people found the ad \"satisfying,\" likening it to a popular YouTube and TikTok series where random objects are squished under a hydraulic press.\n\nApple's controversial ad also coincides with the 40th anniversary of one of its most celebrated commercials,\"1984,\" which aired during that year's Super Bowl.\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott and created by Chiat\\Day, the iconic spot contained a hopeful message about technology, painting a portrait of a dystopian future where computers weren't the enemy or something to be feared.\n\nFor many creatives, though, Apple's \"Crush\" offers the antithesis: an ad where a squished trumpet and the remains of a sculpted bust serve as a visual metaphor for the threat big tech and generative AI pose to the already underfunded, under-appreciated creative industries.\n\n\"On paper, it's a cool idea. It's also a brilliantly crafted film that three years ago creative people would have enjoyed,\" said Alan Young, joint CCO of St. Luke's. \"But not today. Filmmaking, illustration, photography and music are all suddenly being constructed by autonomous systems and this ad, to many, feels like a metaphor for that.\"\n\nFor Jon Evans, chief client officer at ad testing platform System1, the work carries a sinister undertone, even if unintended.\n\n\"Back in 1984 Apple inspired me to crush the boring PC machine to liberate my creativity, but somehow in 2024 we find Apple crushing the output of all that creativity and becoming the very machine they raged against,\" he said.\n\nSystem 1's data, which measures emotional response and brand impact, found Apple's 60-second ad stirred negative emotions for consumers.\n\nThe creative scored just 1.9 out of 5 for its long-term market growth potential, and just 0.78 for its ability to drive short-term sales potential, against the tech category average of 1.07.\n\nOnly 77% of people recognized it as an Apple ad. The spot did drive happiness for 25% of viewers, but it over-indexed for other feelings including surprise, disgust and contempt.\n\nDespite the negative reaction, at the time of writing the work had not yet had a significant impact on Apple's stock price, the value of which has increased 5.93% over the last five days following a host of fresh product launches designed to help it offset slumping iPhone sales.\n\nThough controversial, the ad is unlikely to dent Apple's reputation as one of the world's most valuable brands. In 2022 and 2023 it topped Kantar's BrandZ list with a valuation of $880.45 billion.\n\nFor Tamryn Kerr, co-founder and chief creative officer of Hijinks, the discourse around Apple's \"Crush\" might actually stand in its favor down the line since it brought more attention to the product.\n\n\"As far as Apple is concerned, everyone now knows there's a very thin iPad to add to their Christmas list, so the ad has done its job,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sculpture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_creative_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief creative officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Young"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/applecrush2-600x315.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-23", "dateEnd": "-09-26", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 70}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 225}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

On X, for instance, Apple chief Tim Cook's post sharing the ad has been flooded with criticism.\n\nOne commenter said the ad ironically served as a representation of how tech giants are squashing human creativity with AI. At the same time, Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham suggested Steve Jobs never would have okayed the ad on his watch.\n\nBut it turns out, the ad wasn't even an original idea.\n\nFifteen years ago, Korean electronics company LG used almost exactly the same concept in a UK spot for its Renoir camera phone.\n\nIn that ad, musical instruments, computer monitors, studio lights, and paints are all crushed in a press -- revealing the sleekly intact Renoir in conclusion.\n\nOf course, there's no evidence Apple -- known for its unique marketing prowess -- copied LG's creative.

Apple's 'disturbing' new iPad ad has struck a nerve online", "body": "NEW YORK -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \"replaced\" by technological advances -- particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple's \"Crush!\" commercial on social media this week.\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nToday's Top Headlines UPDATE: Lawyer for Aiken Mayor Milner releases statement on allegation of elder abuse 'A dream come true:' Research project focuses on cemetery Aiken Scholars Academy receives high national rankings from U.S. News and World Report Charter school seniors can't participate in Aiken County school district senior walks No property tax increase included in proposed Aiken County budget for 2024-2025 fiscal year 1 man dead after shooting on Aiken's Southside Suspect arrested in fatal Wagener shooting; victim identified Aiken County authorities looking for missing Salley man Aiken High Students in activism club discuss transformative California field trip experience Great Oak Equine Assisted Programs holds spring horse show\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today -- particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \"crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past -- which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n\"My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\" Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple's famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \"this (new iPad) commercial says, 'No, we're going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.'\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple's success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company's sales.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Well, not quite oblivion -- they were actually crushed into the new iPad Pro.\n\nCreated in-house by Apple's own creative team, the aim of the spot is to illustrate just how many amazing creative tools and possibilities are accessible in the new iPad. All of this, into this. Simple.\n\nBut, it's not quite that simple. As was very clear almost as soon as Apple CEO Tim Cook posted it on X, people were not impressed with the ad's message.

That's one of the many ways to interpret the commercial for the new iPad Pro tablet that was released in the past 14 hours - one that has already made a lot of people \"Think Different\" about the company. Remember when Apple was represented as a \"resistance runner,\" throwing a hammer in the George Orwellian face of the status quo (to sell Macintosh to the public, of course)? In 2024, Apple is proudly represented by... a very large & destructive hydraulic press? Yup. To the tune of Sonny and Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You,\" the promo \"Crush!\" features a large display of televisions, musical instruments, books, video game consoles, and a whole lot more creative things being slowly crushed under the press. And it takes its time - taking up over 50 seconds of the 1:08 ad - making it all that much more disturbing. From there, the press rises to reveal that from that destruction comes - a new (and really thin) iPad Pro.\n\nNow, we're going out on a limb here, and we're going to assume that the message that Apple CEO Tim Cook was going for was that the iPad Pro packs a lot of creative artistry into such a small package. In fact, Cook wrote in the tweet/x he posted to promote the company's new hardware, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\" Except even Cook's can be taken in a very bad way - and that's exactly what we've been seeing on social media. While the Apple CEO may be thinking in tech terms, a lot of folks who use the very things that were destroyed see the commercial as a cynical metaphor for removing the human experience from the creative process - and devaluing the importance of the artist in that process.

If so, bravo!\" another person told Cook.\n\nSome felt the commercial missed the mark compared to Apple's past work. The company made waves with its \"1984\" Super Bowl ad when it introduced its first Macintosh computer in the 80s.\n\n\"Maybe hire Ridley Scott again next time instead,\" read one X post referencing the award-winning director behind the \"1984\" ad.\n\nVenture capitalist and Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham went a step further with his review of the ad.\n\nApple's commercial, Graham said, would've been an insult to the company's late founder, Steve Jobs.\n\n\"Steve wouldn't have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch,\" Graham said in his reply to Cook.\n\nJobs, who handed the reigns to Cook before passing away in October 2011, often sought to portray Apple as lying at the intersection of arts and technology.\n\n\"It is in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough -- it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing,\" Jobs said when he unveiled the iPad 2 in March 2011.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit_(1989_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1989 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning_(camera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panning (camera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Graham (programmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macintosh 128K"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663c8328b4abc992e8c72c81?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 125}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-10-", "textStart": 2009, "textEnd": 2021}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-", "textStart": 2335, "textEnd": 2345}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Shared by CEO Tim Cook, the commercial swiftly went viral and was all over the internet after its release on Tuesday. However, it was labelled as \"tone deaf\" and \"destructive\" and failed to impress a majority of viewers.\n\nThe advert began with a giant hydraulic press above a myriad of creative things like musical instruments, paint cans, a gaming console, speakers, sculptures, etc. The trumpet was the first thing to be crushed and then the compressor goes on to flatten a row of paint cans. Then came the grand piano.\n\nWhen the hydraulic press crushed everything, including popping the eye out of a ball-shaped emoji, it rose to reveal the brand new and the sleekest iPad Pro. The idea behind the commercial was to show how the tablet lets the user do everything like playing or creating music, take photos, make videos, among others, in a more sleek format.\n\n\"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip.

However, the advert failed to impress the audience and was viewed as a visual depiction of \"destruction\". From several Hollywood personalities to other social media users, everyone slammed the commercial for \"disrespecting the creative industry\".\n\n\"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" Hollywood actor Hugh Grant wrote about the ad.\n\n\"Truly, what is wrong with you?\" Justine Bateman, filmmaker and actor, questioned.\n\n\"Like iPads but don't know why anyone thought this ad was a good idea. It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to the arts, to artists musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it's all created by them,\" British filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote.\n\nA user commented, \"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators.\"\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" another user remarked.\n\nA third user added, \"I'm a creator, a traditional artist, a Macintosh user of many years, yet I never even understand why would I need an iPad, and this destruction is extremely distasteful and would never convince me but otherwise.\"\n\n\"This is the most ghoulish, tone-deaf ad I've ever seen in my life. Fire all of your marketers. This is utterly catastrophic for your brand,\" another person chimed in.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has not responded to the backlash as yet.\n\nThe iPad Pro, touted as the thinnest iPad ever, is available in 13 and 11-inch models with silver or black finishes.

The discussion of technology versus creativity has been heightened amid the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), an area where Apple is expected to make more concrete moves soon.\n\nApple's latest iPad Pro, among its first new tablet model releases in two years, comes with a lot of bells and whistles. The device is the thinnest yet from the iPhone maker while also carrying its most advanced display and a hefty amount of computing power due to the new M4 chip, an evolution in Apple silicon. Online discussion isn't focused on the cutting-edge aspects of the device, however, due to an ad that's widely received the thumbs down on social media.\n\nThe ad was reportedly created in-house with production by Iconoclast and directors Vania and Muggia. Marketing Dive has reached out to Apple for comment on details behind the campaign, including its media plan and ad agencies, and will update this story pending a response. The ad also appears on Apple's YouTube, where comments are turned off.\n\nThe video has been painted as the anti-\"1984,\" referencing an iconic Apple commercial that showed people freed from an Orwellian dystopia as a sledgehammer tossed by the protagonist smashes the screen of their oppressor. That effort, which was directed by Ridley Scott and ran around Super Bowl XVIII in 1984, is considered one of the best TV ads of all time.\n\nCritics of the new iPad Pro spot conversely see a dystopian vision brought to life as a variety of tangible art objects are violently crushed into a single piece of technology. Responses to Cook's X post, which had accrued over 49 million views at press time, underscore the frustration. Many creators and artists rely on Apple products for work, adding a sense of betrayal to some of their sentiments.\n\n\"I'm a creator, a traditional artist, a macintosh user of many years, yet I never even understand why would I need an iPad, and this destruction is extremely distasteful and would never convince me but otherwise,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"It is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement. When I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years [sic],\" wrote another.\n\nApple has also positioned the iPad Pro as an \"outrageously\" powerful device for AI. Creatives have expressed concerns that generative AI, which is trained on existing media, unfairly cribs from their work, and raised legal and ethical challenges against the technology. Apple has yet to meaningfully detail its generative AI plans but indicated it will share more news on that front in the near future.\n\n\"I think AI, generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks,\" Cook said on a call with investors discussing Apple's latest round of earnings last week.\n\nThe iPad Pro ad's backlash builds on a bumpy run for Apple.

Its tablet segment also struggled due to a lack of new releases, with revenue falling 17% year-over-year in the opening stretch of 2024.

It may just be the exact wrong message at the exact wrong time.\n\nIt's nothing new that some ads are irksome, and we all know that a hated ad isn't necessarily an ineffective one. When I was 12, there were these burger ads featuring people noisily mushing burgers into their hideous, up-close mouths, and sucking on their fingers like animals. The whole thing made me want to claw my eyes out. (They actually made a lot of people feel this way, I later learned.) But as my dad explained to me at the time, \"The point is, they got your attention.\"\n\nI heard the underlying message loud and clear: Companies don't have to pretend they respect their customers; they just have to get them to part with their money.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Apple will get customers to do just that. Yesterday, my colleague Chris Taylor pointed out that the top-of-the-line new iPad with all the peripherals adds up to a $3,000 package of gadgets, and that -- sticker shock or no -- it's tempting to fork it over for something this cool. But he also noted something that's key to that value proposition for him: The new iPad taps into his fantasies of personal creativity. \"Apple knows our income is always a little more disposable if it can appeal to our wannabe genius,\" he wrote.\n\nWith that in mind, I urge you to watch the \"Crush\" ad one more time, and really contemplate what it's showing you:\n\nAll that stuff -- the paint, the piano, the trumpet, the arcade machine, the illustrator's table -- do you feel any hostility toward it? Do you want to see it destroyed and symbolically turned into an Apple device? Does it give you any satisfaction to see record players annihilated, and cameras all squished, and crumbly, and exploding?\n\nAnd to switch things around a bit, take a look at your nearest Apple device and think about the last time you fantasized about that thing getting crushed. Was it yesterday? Maybe it was five minutes ago. In any case, you probably like it less than you like, say, your guitar.\n\nAlmost exactly 40 years ago, Apple released its most famous ad, \"1984,\" in which a monochrome society of shambling drones is under the spell of some kind of computerized dictator. The prisoners of this terrible society are then liberated from their monotony by a hammer-throwing savior representing the Macintosh computer, and a glorious, colorful future is unleashed.\n\nFast forward 40 years, and Apple is the most valuable company in the world, releasing a commercial in which symbols of creativity, color, joy, human passion, and playfulness are piled into the center of a grey concrete void, and crushed by an industrial machine until they become a little Apple-branded rectangle.\n\nThe message is not playing well.\n\nAnd the timing couldn't be worse. Apple is, at long last, pleasing Wall Street by pivoting to AI -- even going so far as to ramp up development of a new AI cloud infrastructure project made of its own proprietary chips. As Apple CEO Tim Cook said on an earnings call last week, Apple \"believe[s] in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era.\"\n\nTo that end, yesterday's iPad event contained more usage of the term \"AI\" than any Apple product presentation in recent memory. AI enhancements are suddenly being injected into Apple creative tools like Photomator, with its ML Enhance tool, and a new Isolate Subjects option in Final Cut Pro.\n\nNo two ways about it: Apple is now an AI company. And with this ad, Apple seems to be blaring that message from a loudspeaker, perhaps a little more loudly than it even intended. Members of the public seeing \"Crush\" seem to be slowly coming to terms with that eerie new reality.\n\nThe same year Apple released its \"1984\" ad, a little movie called The Terminator debuted, and the folks at Apple may want to take another look at it -- or at least (spoiler alert) its final moments. At its core, The Terminator is a love story about the essential qualities of humanity prevailing over artificial intelligence. Was it the concept of love that James Cameron put in a hydraulic press at the finale? Was it creativity? Joy? Passion? No. The movie spoke to humanity's id, because the cathartic ending of The Terminator is the moment when the hideous artificially intelligent machine got crushed.\n\nThat's the act of creative destruction people will always want to see, and if you're a technology company right now, it's probably a good idea to keep that in mind.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terminator (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fork (software development)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monochrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peripheral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final Cut Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creative destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/067LOyS3syxAff3GGDUSLHI/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1715195425.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

We think of the iconic 1984 ad (directed by Ridley Scott, no less) and the early iPod spots with silhouetted music lovers dancing to \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\" Now, Apple has done the exact opposite of those, inadvertently pushing people away from the product.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook posted the ad - titled \"Crush\" - on X this week, accompanying it with: The ad itself features a wealth of human achievements - from music to mathematics - being crushed in a hydraulic press, ultimately creating the new iPad Pro. That it is set to Sonny and Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You\" definitely has meaning.\n\nThe ad caused immediate widespread backlash, with even celebrities - most of whom probably own several Apple products - lashing out at the utterly insulting video. For a few examples, Hugh Grant sounded off by saying it promoted , documentarian Asif Kapadia noted just how tone deaf it was and actress Justine Bateman just plain wanted to know what the hell is wrong with Apple. Various commentators have called the ad destructive, egotistical and arrogant.\n\nOK, so it's pretty obvious the idea here is that Apple is symbolically collecting all of the knowledge ever known to man into a new product. That in and of itself isn't bad, but the execution here is just about the most disgusting way to go about it. The way the Apple ad comes off, all of the featured advances in humanity are disposable, just footnotes that can be squeezed of their soul, meaning and purpose just for the sake of promoting a piece of 5.3mm-thick piece of technology that will be intentionally outdated in due time. Take a look at the emoji's face near the end and that's basically the collective reaction.\n\nWhat do you make of Apple's latest ad?

A woman's voice then states: \"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest.\"\n\nThe advert, named Crush, was revealed on Apple CEO Tim Cook's X page and has been viewed 45m times at the time of writing, attracting 12,000 comments and 25,000 likes. But, rather than being applauded for clever and creative advertising as is so often the case with the tech giants, the advert has come in for a storm of criticism.\n\nThe dystopian ad has been branded 'tone deaf', 'soul-crushing' and 'surprising' by X members. It appears the wanton destruction of some of the most celebrated human creations did not go down well with many.\n\nBritish actor Hugh Grant was among those to slam the advert, taking to social media to say: \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all.

Don't doubt it's unintentional but it's in bad taste,\" said @sainimatic in a reference to Steve Jobs, the late Apple co-founder who died in 2011.\n\n@abhinayx summed it up by saying: \"Was definitely surprising.

Equipped with an M4 chip, the new iPad Pro has stirred up mixed reactions among social media users due to the company's marketing tactics. Shared by CEO Tim Cook on his X handle, the commercial has faced significant backlash for \"crushing\" artistic things. While initially appearing as a brilliant work by Apple's creative team, the clip takes a disappointing turn as it showcases numerous elements of human creativity being \"destroyed\" under a giant hydraulic press.\n\nAs the video plays, one can spot a lot of musical instruments and classical sculptures crushing and cracking one by one. The tubes of paint pop like balloons, gushing all over the place and within seconds, everything is pancaked by the giant hydraulic press. It is then that the remnants of the destruction transform into the iPad Pro. \"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip. Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create,\" Tim Cook wrote in his caption.\n\nApple's message is simple: one can do everything with a single iPad. However, this doesn't seem to have clicked with users who slammed the company for \"destroying the whole history of human creativity\" by the unstoppable force of technology.\n\nInternet Unhappy With New iPad Ad\n\nA user wrote, \"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" while another one commented, \"The symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools is an interesting choice.\"\n\nIn reference to Apple's famous advertisement from 1984, a user wrote, \"Forty years ago, Apple released the 1984 commercial as a bold statement against a dystopian future. Now you are that dystopian future. Congratulations.\"\n\n\"You destroyed all the creative tools and effort of humans. Worst. Commercial. Ever,\" a user slammed the company.\n\nA user while criticising the destruction of reality commented, \"Everything beautiful, charming, and analog will be destroyed by a flat black screen You must never see a sculpted bust Never hear music from an actual instrument Never feel the texture of real things A silicon slab (and Tim Cook) will permanently stand between u and the world.\"\n\nAs shared a day ago, the reactions are just increasing over the commercial.

(Credit: Apple)\n\nApple created a lot of stir with the advertisement for its new generation iPad Pro. The shocking video shows a huge variety of things we love, including musical instruments and artistic tools, being crushed by a cold, dark metal press. Is Apple admitting its apocalyptic agenda?\n\nMy friend and fellow pastor Brad Edwards summed up how many reacted to the ad succinctly in a post on X:\n\nIf \"the medium is the message,\" what story is being told by a company that destroys instruments of human creativity to sell a device for consuming digital media?\n\nWhatever it is, @Apple is only furthering our Digital Disenchantment. This is absolutely \"anti-human\" (@pauljpastor).\n\nDoes this ad, and the technology Apple is now purveying, push for \"the anti-human\"? Is the company that once put out the anti-Orwellian ad now openly admitting to smashing the essence of human creativity and turning us into mindless zombies?\n\nI have critiqued certain recent directions of Apple on this front. The introduction of the Vision Pro, felt \"anti-human,\" down to the intro video's dad engulfed in the device's screen while ostensibly interacting with his young daughter.\n\nSteve Jobs' Apple prided itself on sitting at the \"intersection of technology and the liberal arts,\" as he proudly pointed out when introducing the iPad 14 years ago. That's the Apple I became a fan of with my first Mac long before the iPad.\n\nIf the gargantuan Apple of today is defined by the Vision Pro's dystopian-hued palette, and this commercial is a visual manifesto furthering that, color me worried.\n\nI am not, however, worried. At least not today.\n\nFirst, the commercial itself. We need to note what was \"destroyed\" by the gigantic metal press. I already listed the symbols of creativity destroyed, but they were accompanied by an arcade machine, record player, Angry Birds, a TV and other consumption artifacts new and old.\n\nRather than a statement rejecting the creative impulse (or the media consumption one), it was a statement of the vision of the iPad as containing those things. Notably when the crushing machine released its grip, there was not the twisted wreckage of the things earlier shown but an iPad. Apple's thesis is that the iPad is forged from all those beloved things pressed together to form it.\n\nWhich brings us to the device behind the commercial. This has been the longtime trajectory of the iPad. Jobs introduced it by sitting in a chair and being able to touch very human things: photos, music and the like. That first iPad could do only a small fraction of what the modern ones can do, but the premise was clear: the capability of a laptop in a profoundly analog touchable form. \"Magical.\"\n\nTablets like the Amazon Fire Tablet are consumption devices hardly good for anything but consuming media. Even their 16:9 ratio displays cry out \"I'm a small TV, zone out with me.\" But the iPad has the aspect ratio of paper and is a decade and a half story of growing better at creating.\n\nI regularly do image and editing, writing and long-form reading from my iPad. The average iPad is more powerful than many laptops while feeling profoundly less like being enmeshed in a computer. Slicing the audio of a podcast into pieces with a finger and tactilely dropping in soundbites and music before publishing the latest episode of Zippy makes the work of preparing a creative effort more humane and less sterilely digital.\n\nContrary to the Vision Pro placing us in an illusory \"real world\" that isn't, the iPad has always been about allowing digital creativity to come as tangibly near our reality as presently possible.\n\nThe commercial was a provocative visualization, yes. But one expressing the height of technology serving the human impulse to create, not the destruction of that yearning. More than the remoteness of a mouse pointer on a computer and more than the tininess of a phone, the iPad can start to feel like a canvas welcoming one's paintbrush, typewriter or musical stage.\n\nThis is Apple at its best, because they not only painted a shocking visualization of humane technology, but can support it with their unrivaled processors. There is nothing else available that rivals the current M2-based iPad, much less the coming M4-based ones in capability.\n\nThe reason tablets often feel like consumption devices is that they are too anemic technologically to do much else. I can attest that the iPad really can be a media creation powerhouse.\n\nApple's M4 processor will amplify that, as do the ever-better displays Apple uses that make whatever is on screen feel more physically present and less like something \"displayed.\" The more quietly tucked-in power Apple piles on, the more we can think of creative pursuits and not the technological limitations that too often become guardrails to those pursuits.\n\nThus, I'm optimistic, though the bigger tell won't be this month's event, but next month's. All rumors, and official comments, point to Apple announcing a huge set of AI initiatives at its annual developer conference.\n\nWe rightly both celebrate the creative potential of AI and fear its possibility of crushing creativity. Apple, as the premier advocate for on-device, private AI technologies can potentially weld the iPad's significant uptick in power to make it the premier device for machine learning that supports creativity. Creative AI will be best served by powerful devices we control, not huge cloud server farms under the control of others.\n\nTechnology can drown out human creativity, but at its best, it can also rise to be a palette of breathtaking colors for us the next wave of human artistry. If Apple pushes for healthy use of AI, and pairs it with technology meant to disappear behind the things we make, that will double down on the vision of the iPad as forged from the humane.", "source": {"uri": "ofb.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Open for Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Edwards_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Edwards (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arcade cabinet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aspect ratio (image)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palette (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artifact (archaeology)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://ofb.biz/phoenix/images/marquee/smashingiPadBanner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

There's a concrete sense of tangibility that a device like the iPad can't replicate, regardless of how powerful, thin or capable it is. And in the age of AI where executives across various industries feel art created by human beings is no longer important, I can see why this ad may have triggered a negative response from many.\n\nBut isn't this also Steve Jobs' original pitch for the iPhone: a device that's an iPod, a mobile phone and an internet browser. This ad is just a clever extension of that concept presented in a different, more engaging way.\n\nPlus, watching things get crushed is entertaining.

The ad features an industrial press crushing a series of objects that create and reflect art to bits -- including books, musical instruments, paint cans, statues, a record player, a camera, an old TV, and a classic arcade game machine, CNBC reports -- that then give way to the company's latest iPad. The destruction is accompanied by the upbeat \"All I Ever Need Is You\" by Sonny & Cher. In a post on X with the video, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote on Tuesday, \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\"\n\nOnline backlash followed from people, including Hollywood creators, who don't share Apple's excitement. One tech person's post on X said the ad is \"crushing symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements to appeal to pro creators.\" Actor Hugh Grant wrote, per Variety: \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\" Asif Kapadia, a producer, director, and writer, posted a backhanded compliment: \"It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to the arts, to artists musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it's all created by them.\"\n\nThe new model went on sale Tuesday. Apple, which touted the thinness of the iPad Pro as another selling point, did not respond to requests for comment about the ad. Politicians jumped in, as well, with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy asking in his post: \"Does it weird you out that the technology elite have this level of hubris and this much disdain for the the history of human creation?\" Filmmaker Reza Sixo Safai tried to undo the damage, posting a version of the commercial with the video running in reverse with the comment, \"Hey @Apple, I fixed it for you.\" (More Apple stories.)", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_cronin@newser.com", "name": "Bob Cronin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Kapadia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asif Kapadia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img2-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1533883-12-20240508195347.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Tubes of paint burst open, releasing a vibrant cascade of color across Apple's meticulously crafted tableau of creativity.\n\nUltimately, the hydraulic press achieves its objective, flattening this symbolic representation of the entirety of human creativity under the weight of Apple's relentless innovation.\n\nAs the press lifts, all the artistic stuff disappears, and what's left is Apple's new, stylish iPad Pro.\n\nThe issue isn't simply the act of watching items being crushed. Numerous online channels are dedicated to destroying everyday objects, and such occurrences are common at transfer stations and recycling centers.\n\nAdditionally, the value of crushed items is not the primary concern. While items like pianos may hold some value, many objects depicted are perceived as disposable or easily replaceable.\n\nThe problem lies not with the quality of the video itself but with the underlying message conveyed by the ad.\n\nThe advertisement's main message is that the new iPad can accomplish all the tasks demonstrated. However, many people perceive the ad as disregarding the value of tangible items being crushed, such as pianos and paint, to prioritize promoting the latest technology.\n\nApple's strategy involves destroying physical objects to persuade consumers that they don't require them. Instead, the company promotes its device as a versatile alternative that replaces strings, keys, buttons, brushes, and mixing stations.\n\nThe shift towards digital and always-online media has brought positive and negative impacts. While technology has empowered many aspects of our lives, digital transformation can also feel imposed and detrimental.\n\nIt represents a vision of the future endorsed by wealthy tech elites, where every child has an AI companion and learns to play virtual instruments on a touchscreen.\n\nApple appears to have overlooked that the real-world objects it destroyed lend value to their digital counterparts. The ad suggests a future without physical items like paint bottles, dials, sculptures, musical instruments, and paper books, echoing the future Apple has been promoting for years.\n\nAlso read: Apple Launches New iPad Pro and iPad Air: Here's How to Pre-Order\n\nThe last time Apple used this approach, the entertainment industry wasn't embroiled in debates about AI threatening jobs. Hollywood writers and actors weren't fighting to protect their roles, and game studios hadn't yet laid off thousands of workers.\n\nAI-generated musicians weren't causing uproar among record labels and artists on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\n\nConcerns about AI automation taking over traditional human jobs weren't as prominent back then as today. However, the conversation about computers and automation has shifted recently, and Apple seems to have missed the memo.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "inno_flores@techtimes.com", "name": "Inno Flores", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_synthesizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software synthesizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "String instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio mixing (recorded music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/446970/820/0/0/0/screenshot-from-crush-ipad-pro-apple.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

It featured a woman in a white tank top and bright red shorts destroying a monochrome screen with a sledgehammer.\n\nThis week, Apple CEO Tim Cook promoted a new ad titled \"Crush\" that gave the exact opposite message and led to a furious backlash on social media. The ad begins with lights coming on in a factory setting with cultural items and artifacts stacked on top of each other, all gathered on a giant industrial press.\n\nThen the press begins to lower as a Sonny and Cher song plays. A piano is smashed and splattered with paint buckets. An arcade machine, a drawing figure, record player, trumpet, vintage film and stock cameras are destroyed. A Greek bust is smashed, and eventually the press, drooling with several different colors of paint, closes completely. When it lifts up, the new iPad rests in the middle with a voiceover bragging about how thin it is.\n\nAs several people noted on X, the ad was a direct inverse of the Nineteen Eighty-Four ad and representative of the destruction of physical media and the culture that made America. One poster on X wrote, \"Apple's new 'Crush' ad (let's call it '2024') is a visual & metaphorical bookend to the 1984 ad. 1984: Monochrome, conformist, industrial world exploded by colorful, vibrant human 2024: Colorful, vibrant humanity is crushed by monochrome, conformist, industrial press.\"\n\nWall Street Journal tech reporter Katie Deighton noted, \"This ad perfectly encapsulates the insight that people think technology is killing everything we ever found joy in. And then presents that as a good thing.\"\n\nWhatever Apple intended, the reaction was catastrophic and the exact opposite of its intention. Apple might have been attempting to say that a piano can be played on the new iPad, however, the ad made it seem like the destruction of piano keys, and the human touch involved in creating on it, was unnecessary and needed to be destroyed. Sculptures might be viewed in 3-D design style, but not viewed in real life with the human eyes. And who needs books anymore when you can swipe a \"page\" on a flat screen?\n\nThere is another problem with the new \"Crush\" ad as well. As digital media moves to censor certain books, films, TV episodes and other forms of content now deemed problematic, the need for physical media is greater than ever. Apple did not just take a subtle jab at physical media and content; it literally destroyed the idea out of existence.\n\nArt and culture may very well be headed for complete virtual-reality viewing in the next decade or so, but perhaps Silicon Valley and tech companies shouldn't take such obvious elation in it.

However, during the announcement, Apple aired a seemingly innocent \"Crush!\" commercial that has caused an uproar.\n\nIn the commercial, a hydraulic press descends upon artistic creations. It starts crushing musical instruments and other pieces of art, which was probably meant to play upon the social media trend of seeing how things will crush under a press. Just like those videos, once the press reaches paint, a smattering of colors explodes all over.\n\nWhen the press reaches the bottom, the entire human artistic experience has been crushed.\n\nThe press, having finished its job, begins to rise up. Instead of what was there before, only an iPad Pro remains, implying that the tablet can replace everything that was just crushed by the hydraulic press. It's a visually pleasing commercial with lots of colors and a plot twist at the end, with the iPad emerging from the destruction.\n\nI thought nothing of it during the iPad reveal event other than, \"That was pretty neat.\" But it appears that I didn't read the room very well. With thousands of jobs in artistic fields being threatened by AI (including mine at some point), it seems that implying technology can replace human artists' tools is a touchy subject.\n\nAs noted by Deadline, a few celebrities have weighed in. Hugh Grant took to X to say the commercial is the \"destruction of human experience.\" Justine Bateman responded to Apple CEO Tim Cook's post featuring the commercial by saying, \"Truly, what is wrong with you?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ed Solomon of Men in Black and Bill & Ted fame, implied what he feels Apple is trying to say with its ad, \"Who needs human life and everything that makes it worth living? Dive into this digital simulacrum and give us your soul. Sincerely, Apple.\"\n\nAlex Cranz of The Verge said they immediately thought, \"Oh, this was not the right time for this commercial.\" That seems to be a common sentiment.

The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they are very, very sorry for flattening the whole of human creativity to convince consumers to buy another iPad.\n\nApple's latest blunder, a new commercial entitled \"Crush,\" was supposed to excite people about shelling out another grand for another iPad. However, because consumers spent the last few years being taken for fools by tech companies that can't seem to make anything anymore, most read this as a pretty clear metaphor for how Apple and its ilk have treated art during this tech bubble. Like Rodney Dangerfield, the arts get no respect. So, in a rarity for the company, Apple has apologized.\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" said Apple's VP of Marketing Communications Tor Myhren told AdAge. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\"\n\nThe ad sees a massive hydraulic press slowly crushing instruments of artistic expression, like a trumpet, a record player, a piano, a guitar, paint cans, and more, into a really cool new iPad. Though Apple, as is its wont, hoped to highlight the razor-thin size of their latest tablet, most interpreted it as an insensitive metaphor for how tech giants are attempting to replace creativity with AI junk that doesn't work. It's almost as if Apple doesn't own a Hollywood studio that produces work written by the same WGA writers and starring the same SAG actors who spent last year striking against machine-written gobbledygook and AI-generated Pixar characters with 13 fingers and four rows of teeth. Apple, for its part, also released a pair of $3,500 ski goggles no one wanted this year, so the goodwill that shielded the company from accusations of worker exploitation (here and abroad) and weaponizing tax loopholes is wearing as thin as the all-new iPad.\n\n\"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we've ever created, the most advanced display we've ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted yesterday. \"Just imagine all the things it'll be used to create.\" Most imagined all the things Apple was destroying. As bestselling author Hari Kunzru put it: \"Crushing the symbols of human creativity to produce a homogenized branded slab is pretty much where the tech industry is at in 2024.\"\n\nThe last time Apple released an apology was in September 2012, when Tim Cook posted a letter on the company's website expressing regret over the release of Apple Maps. So, if anything, we can rest assured that the backlash to this shortsighted commercial convinced someone to think different.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

The ad, which compresses a myriad of artistic tools into an iPad Pro, has caught the attention of both tech enthusiasts and the creative community.\n\nThe 'Crush' commercial, which debuted during Apple's 'Let Loose' event and quickly made its way to YouTube, showcases a large hydraulic press that methodically crushes a variety of creative tools -- musical instruments, painting and film editing equipment, DJ consoles, and more. The captivating 62-second visual concludes with these items being compacted into the new iPad Pro, underscored by the nostalgic tune \"All I Ever Need Is You\" by Sonny & Cher. The message is clear: everything you need for creative endeavors can now be found in one device - iPad Pro.\n\nWhile the commercial has been praised for its cool factor and the seamless integration of product and concept, it has also faced criticism from some artists and viewers who dislike the implication of replacing physical art tools with digital alternatives. The mixed reactions highlight the ongoing debate between digital and traditional methods in creative fields. Apple had to turn off the comments on its YouTube video.\n\nHowever, Apple's commercial has reminded some viewers of a similar advertisement by LG back in 2008 for its Renoir KC910 smartphone. Like Apple's ad, LG's version featured various objects being compressed into a phone, symbolizing the device's versatility. This parallel has led to discussions about the originality of Apple's current marketing approach and whether it was inspired by LG's earlier creative work. You can watch the LG commercial from 2008 below :\n\nWith the commercial, Apple aims not just to promote the technical specifications of the iPad Pro -- like its 3nm M4 chip and Tandem OLED display panel, referred to in the ad as Ultra Retina XDR display -- but also to assert the device's capability as a comprehensive tool for creative individuals. The choice of integrating so many different artistic elements into the advertisement reflects a strategic move to appeal to a diverse audience, from music producers to graphic designers and filmmakers.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddharth_shankar@news9live.com", "name": "Siddharth Shankar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_(Jennifer_Paige_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crush (Jennifer Paige song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retina display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic designer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Installations_and_Performances", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Installations and Performances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Is-Apples-New-iPad-Pro-Ad-a-Blast-from-LGs-Past.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

AdAge reports that Apple said the video \"missed the mark\" and has scrapped plans to run the cutesy-turned-cringey commercial on TV.\n\nIt's clear that Apple intended for the ad to serve as a metaphor for all the myriad creative tools one has when they throw down $1,000 or more for a new iPad Pro. Run during Tuesday's event, the video shows a series of musical instruments and creative tools, including a guitar, drums, trumpet, amplifiers, record player, TV and much more. \"All I Ever Need Is You\" by Sonny & Cher soundtracks the clip.\n\nSoon, it's revealed that the objects are all sitting on an industrial crusher. The crusher descends upon the scattered creative instruments, exploding in plumes of colorful smoke. But when the crusher pulls back up, it's revealed that everything was transformed into a shiny new iPad Pro.\n\nA decade ago, this ad likely wouldn't have been a big deal. But Apple's marketers completely whiffed on the context of the moment. The ad comes weeks before Apple will take the stage at WWDC to announce its generative AI features that its investors have been salivating for.\n\nGenerative AI, as you may have heard, needs something to train on -- and that means humans' work. It trains on existing content to make algorithmically generated words, pictures, music or who knows what else. It also has the capability to put those same creators -- most of whom don't have cushy jobs at Apple or other Big Five tech companies -- out of work as corporations and consumers eagerly adopt the robots destined to put creators on the unemployment line.\n\nContext is everything, and Apple failed spectacularly there. Its ad serves as a spectacularly perfect metaphor for generative AI's potential to crush human creation, turning us all into \"prompt artists\" who type words into text boxes to replace their years of training and experience. (Granted, generative AI has genuinely exciting applications, too, but much more needs to be made of the society-level chaos it can and will unleash.)\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Tor Myhren, Apple VP of marketing communications, told AdAge. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad.

The Internet's reaction is far from what the company would have hoped for, as fans have widely criticized the creative decision behind the video. Check out the video below, and how fans have reacted.\n\nApple's 'Crush' video signifies the actions in the video, as loads of creative musical instruments and other creative objects, used to make art, get crushed by a giant hydraulic press machine. Slowly and steadily, the press gets lowered towards the platform which is filled with stuff such as paint buckets, a TV, cameras, an arcade gaming machine, and more.\n\nOnce everything is pretty much destroyed, the press rises again, and there's only an iPad Pro tablet left as the voiceover artist in the video says that \"the most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest\" with the background song lyrics stating, \"All I ever need is you.\"\n\nThe idea behind the video is pretty obvious to comprehend, as Apple wishes to convey that the iPad Pro is a one-stop solution for all your needs. However, seeing instruments and other man-made equipment that have been used to create art for decades, some even centuries, is not a sight that people on the Internet agree with.\n\nComments on the YouTube video are conveniently turned off but the X (formerly Twitter) post from Apple CEO Tim Cook is filled with negative reactions to this marketing decision.\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" replied one user.\n\nAnother user dubbed it the worst commercial ever whereas one particular user said that the \"symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools is an interesting choice.\" An X user simply said that the video \"does not spark joy.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how Apple will respond to the criticism if they do. However, the sentiment that crushing creative tools beloved by creators across the world in favour of promoting an electronic gadget is perhaps not the best way to put your point across.\n\nThere are loads of other reactions and here are a few of them:", "source": {"uri": "in.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_in/screenshot/default/m16-12_z5bt.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

I can't really articulate why I constantly think about that scene. I think the imagery tickles the same part of my brain that's drawn to those videos where sickos drop molten steel balls into mayonnaise or smoosh piles of candy with hydraulic presses. This is a very Fincherian thing: to feel like destroying something beautiful. It's perverted, yet satisfying, and dare I say, a touch erotic.\n\nI'm not sure Apple meant to gesture toward those feelings when it released the new iPad Pro ad that's gotten people into a tizzy, but for me, at least, it did:\n\nLit like a Saw film, the spot, titled \"Crush!,\" opens in an industrial basement where a mountain of cultural objects are placed on the business end of a huge hydraulic press: a television, an arcade cabinet, a trumpet, a turntable, art supplies, an inexplicable Angry Birds bust, and so on. Sonny & Cher's \"All I Ever Need Is You\" plays as the press slowly descends, and the camera cuts between close-ups of different objects being decimated by the will of the machine. It's a murder scene. Television glass shatters. Books flatten. Paint spurts everywhere. In a gnarly touch, the ad closes out with a yellow-emoji stress ball exploding through its eyes. What the ad tries to communicate in terms of a product pitch is obvious: Here are all the analog objects you don't need anymore because their functions are squeezed into an iPad, now thinner and sleeker than ever. But the symbolism, perhaps inadvertent, is clear too: Here's Big Tech reducing the humanities into flatness. Backlash to the ad has ensued; some are calling it \"gruesomely arrogant\" and \"tone-deaf,\" while others are noting its \"fascist aesthetic.\" Comments on the YouTube version of the ad were turned off by the company less than a day after it was first uploaded.\n\nAll those accusations are true, by the way. The ad clearly descends from the \u00dcbermensch strain of tech-bro braggadocio that defined the halcyon days of the early 2010s, when apps like Yo were going to save the world. Those vibes are more muted these days, but they still persist through the fomenting hype around how AI is going to transform everything (and take our jobs) and how crypto is going to make us rich (if it doesn't implode). That this ad came from Apple -- once led by the tyrannical but arts-loving Steve Jobs, he of the \"computers as the bicycle of the mind\" mantra -- feels like some crossing of a threshold. Back in the day, the tech conglomerate was canny about how it represented that relationship between technology and art. It was also a place that routinely made cultural moments out of new product releases and deft use of advertising. But these days, the defining image is Tim Cook limply waving the checkered flag at a Formula One race. My deep personal passion for Apple TV+ aside (accused by some of being an also-ran in the streaming wars), the company is a boring, thoroughly forgettable version of its former self. Name one other recent iPad ad. Are you really excited about another iPhone? Sure, the hubbub around \"Crush!\" could ultimately be seen as a win. If backlash is attention, and all attention is good, then all this will net out to a positive for Cupertino. At least we're talking about it, right?\n\nBut my issue with the spot is aesthetic: It should've gone harder. \"Crush!\" brought Daniel Craig's asphyxiation to my mind, but in the manner of all Apple ads, the violence on display is too clean, too sleek. You pray for more sweat, more bodily fluid. You know what else an iPad replaces? The need to see your friends in person; they should've gone under the press, too. A braver version of Apple would've just owned its reputation as a tech overlord. Make me call you Daddy already.

The ad for the new iPad Pro triggered an uproar on social media on Wednesday, May 8, after many perceived it as a subliminal message of technology replacing human creativity.\n\nThe minute-long Ad called Crush, which dropped on Tuesday, May 7, showed a heavy-duty machine pulverizing all creative materials, including musical instruments, sculpture and an analogue camera, as the soundtrack of the Sonny and Cher 1971 tune \"All I Ever Need Is You\" plays in the background.\n\nThe Apple commercial sparked outrage online as many opined it implied generative AI can easily replace human creativity. Several social media users took offense to the ad, rendering the creative tools superfluous in the age of technology. Among the people who slammed the new commercial was actor Hugh Grant, who wrote on X, \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nWilly Wonka actor's tweet eviscerating Apple comes amid growing fears that AI could potentially replace Hollywood creatives. The Bridget Jones Diary Star was not the only celebrity to blast the commercial. Emmy-winning and Directors Guild Award-winning Handmaid's Tale director Reed Morano addressed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly after the latter posted a link to the commercial on his X account. Morano wrote, \"Hey @tim_cook, READ THE ROOM, BRO. CUZ THIS S*IT IS ACTUALLY PSYCHOTIC.\"\n\nJustine Bateman asked Tim Cook, \"Truly, What is wrong with you.\" Meanwhile, the ad has been watched almost 400,000 times on YouTube since its release. Tim Cook has yet to respond to the criticism online as the outrage intensified.", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anushree_madappa@koimoi.com", "name": "Anushree Madappa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Ever_Need_Is_You_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All I Ever Need Is You (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Morano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reed Morano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willy Wonka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2024/05/hugh-grant-slams-controversial-apples-crushing-ipad-ad-calls-it-destruction-of-the-human-experience.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 322, "textEnd": 327}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 479, "textEnd": 484}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Capitalizing on the \"thin\" aspect, the promo commercial, titled \"Crush!\" has been turning heads and could also be accused of crushing the human spirit.\n\nThe commercial plays to the song \"All I Need is You\" by Sonny & Cher, opening up with a metronome and a record player. Then, the scene broadens out to show a platform in the middle of a room piled with an array of gadgets and knickknacks, like a drum set, cans of paint, a trumpet, piano, bust of a Greco-Roman figure, a globe, chess set, and other goods that the mind naturally associates with human creativity and intellect. Above the arrangement, a massive metal plate slowly descends, crushing it all into a pulp and compressing it into the all-new 2024 iPad Pro.\n\nThe viewer watches as a guitar gets mashed to splinters, a wood sketching model gets bent backward, and the clay bust of a human head is slowly pancaked into indistinguishable mush. And we get Tim Cook's sleek and soulless invention, a device that supposedly holds all those instruments and human endeavors in its cold heart of silicon.\n\nIt's certainly the most bizarre tech ad I've ever seen, besides perhaps the dystopian 2022 Super Bowl Meta ad, which was so depressing it may have sent investors scurrying faster than field mice in a rainstorm.\n\nThe reaction on X to the iPad commercial, though, has been overwhelming negative from what I've seen, with users saying that it's creepy, depressing, and even \"anti-human.\" The point of the ad is obviously to show that this thin device can be a library of all the objects that were destroyed, but watching the video makes one feel that we're actually losing a lot and gaining quite little in return. For instance, you can get a piano app on an iPad, but do we seriously that compares to an actually Grand or Yamaha in a concert hall? And what about the clay mold of the bust? Is that a message to sculptors and potters that they should throw their craft to the garbage bin? I hope not. The platform of goods, crushed for the sake of a new Apple gadget, represents the multifaceted and wondrous array of human achievement. And it isn't clear those achievements or endeavors are replicable on a screen.\n\nIt was a weird commercial that may have revealed something disturbingly accurate about some of these Big Tech corporations. Do they want to make our lives better or flatten our experience to enhance their own business model and ever-fattening wallets? Based on this commercial, it seems Apple wants to monopolize the world of art, beauty, and experience, cloistering it inside a screen.", "source": {"uri": "mindmatters.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mind Matters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bust (sculpture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Promotional recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_&_Cher", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny & Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metronome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yamaha Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://mindmatters.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/3d-rendering-illustration-of-a-broken-marble-fragment-of-head-sculpture-in-classical-style-with-pixel-sorting-glitched-broken-part-in-monochromatic-grey-tones-isolated-on-black-background-stockpack-adobe-stock-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Has the criticism gone too far?", "body": "Yesterday, Apple released a new ad to promote the launch of its 13-inch iPad Pro. Set to All I Ever Need is You by Sonny & Cher, the spot shows a range of artistic items such as musical instruments, paint tins and sculptures being crushed by a huge hydraulic press.\n\nThe reaction online from people within or adjacent to the advertising industry has been thick and fast. Overwhelmingly, they argue that it appears Apple is highlighting how the rise of new technologies is pulverizing human-led creativity. On the other hand, some commentators have argued that it simply shows how we have the whole world at our fingertips through our phones and computers. (You can judge for yourself.)\n\nOne prominent advertising industry creative who posted that she was in favor of the ad has received over 90 comments, most of them angry in tone and not necessarily conducive to constructive debate. When approached by The Drum to comment on the furor, she declined due to how out of hand the trolling had become.\n\nThe 'pile-on' attitude, with sexist undertones, has done little to add to what could have been an interesting conversation about a divisive bit of advertising. Creativity in all forms is subjective, after all.\n\nSo what does all of this say about how, as an industry, we voice our opinions on work that doesn't resonate with us? We asked some experts to weigh in.\n\nJerry Daykin, client-side media consultant and WFA ambassador: \"I've had 50,000 views and over 1,000 interactions on my Tweet suggesting the whole thing could be resolved by playing it in reverse. They're pretty distinctly divided between the advertising and creative community who thinks it's a massive fail and the strict Apple loyalists or crypto bros who think we're all stupid for not understanding the premise.\n\n\"Like most things, the reality is probably in the middle. It's an OK advert that'll probably work fine, but could just have been a lot better and conscious. It is a cautionary moment for Apple, which has gone from being the creative industry upstart to the dominant corporate force, but the main lesson is probably not to get lost in social media echo chambers.\"\n\nJames Cross, chief creative officer and founder, Meanwhile: \"It is brilliant to see 'Advertising Twitter' spring back to life, and all because of a wonderful piece of film that is probably the best of the year so far.\n\n\"Apple is doing what it does better than just about anyone; an exquisitely beautiful product demo. *Chef's kiss.*\n\n\"But, it seems Advertising Twitter has forgotten how to behave. The reaction to good friends voicing delight has been extreme and frankly bonkers. The metaphorical compression of these tools into a single device has also been (clearly mis-)construed as the literal destruction of creative tools forcibly submitting to Apple's 'thinnest iPad yet.'\n\n\"I don't get, or even believe, some of the outrage. The ad is, clearly, 'big things made small.' A simple analogy for ordinary punters, AKA consumers. So think about this, my grumbling colleagues; just like the camera/microphone/calculator/laptop/newspaper/satnav/calorie counter/TV/stereo that each of us carry around in our pockets (you know that iPhone thing?) it is still smaller than the new iPad and has never replaced your trumpet or paintbrushes. AI won't either.\n\n\"Get a grip.\"\n\nTamryn Kerr, co-founder and chief creative officer, Hijinks: \"I think the reaction to this ad is totally over the top and the subsequent Twitter pile-on is completely out of order. Given the AI doom and gloom in the ad industry, I can understand the sensitivity.\n\n\"However, like 9.43 million other people, I subscribe to the @HydraulicPressChannel on YouTube. It's one of many channels that prides itself on squashing literally everything. So, my read on this was that it was borrowing from culture, not killing creativity. Perhaps the ad industry needs to get out more..\"\n\nNoa Dekel, creative strategist (ex-Facebook and Publicis): \"Like a good art piece, it can be interpreted in many directions, and further, it ought to do so. The harsh response from the marketing community has been exaggerated and felt very personal.\n\n\"Some comments are truly ridiculous, such as 'It mocks creators,' 'Steve wouldn't have shipped it,' 'probably best to kill it' and 'I'm ashamed of Apple' as a response, which is outrageous.\n\n\"Ironically, this type of criticism comes from the same members who complain about ads playing it too safe and not pushing the limits of creativity. Sure, it's not a perfect ad; it's not particularly happy, clear or comforting. But it's provocative and it got people talking, which is exactly what ads should be doing.\n\n\"I must admit there were times in the past when the response was indeed justified (eg, Kendall Pepsi and 'Facebook is Like Chairs'). But this is solid work, with a great tune, strong visuals and an underlying legitimate analogy - compressing creative tools into one device.\n\n\"Perhaps if we were a little less afraid to make ourselves feel uncomfortable and more open to (gasp) destroying an AI piano, the industry wouldn't be losing its relevance and magic.\"\n\nAlan Young, joint chief creative officer, St Luke's: \"Apple was the client that made me want to work at Chiat Day. Right from the start, Apple was the brand that stood for making the work of creative people possible and this latest ad is, intellectually, a demonstration of that.\n\n\"So why does the creative community hate it? The issue is not so much the idea as its timing. Suddenly, illustrators, photographers, filmmakers and music composers are seeing their craft competently handled by AI and, to many of them, it feels, literally, crushing.\n\n\"The comments are OTT when you look at the ad without its cultural context, but understandable from a community that fear AI makes many of their old-school craft skills redundant.\"\n\nJo Bromilow, social strategy director, Golin: \"I do think it's demonstrative of the issue we know the industry has with making ads for everyone other than consumers; it's notable that most of the ire has come from the creative and artistic community in media and in agencies while the consumer reaction hasn't risen to the top at all.\n\n\"I understand the outrage among creative folks, however; it's a strikingly uncomfortable visual metaphor for an industry that's being increasingly impacted by technology and will potentially prompt an interesting change in the way creative companies represent technology as a partner, rather than an enabler, in advertising campaigns.\"\n\nJonny Turnbull, senior planner, Saatchi & Saatchi: \"I think there has been a bit of an overreaction, but it's entirely based on the execution, not the idea.\n\n\"The overreaction has come in different flavors. One rages against the visual crushing of nostalgia and analog entertainment and another rages against Apple becoming what its 1984 ad stood against.\n\n\"But fundamentally, I don't think the idea is any different from the '1,000 songs in your pocket' when Jobs launched the iPod or the 'Battery For Miles' iPhone 14 launch. This is just 'all the creative tools you need crammed into the slimmest iPad yet.'\n\n\"So, in short, yes, there has been an overreaction, but it's because people are responding to the execution, not the idea. And I think we should respond to the idea for what it is: a tried and tested approach to brilliant product advertising.\"\n\nLucy Hudson, managing director, McCann Birmingham: \"This discussion again highlights the importance of healthy debate in advertising, but for anyone still sitting in creative reviews in agencyland, you will know it is still alive and well!\n\n\"However, crucial to that debate in the 'real world' is that we remember the purpose of advertising - to bring the truth about a brand or product to life in consumers' lives. The response to this work comes from a very impassioned community, but it remains unfair to measure the advert against anything other than what it is designed for - illustrating why these products are so well loved by consumers.\"\n\nJacob Brodmann, creative director and founder, An Honest Day's Work: \"Adland has gone soft. Let's have a bit of perspective here. The world's going to shit and you're moaning about fucking advertising.\n\n\"Some people forget what we're trying do here.

The \"Crush!\" advertisement adopts a sinister tone as it shows a massive hydraulic press destroying a variety of artistic and cultural items, such as colorful paint cans and vintage record players. The triumphant unveiling of the new iPad, positioned as a potent all-in-one device replacing the crushed antiquities, caps off this symphony of destruction.\n\nHowever, the ad has struck a nerve with its core audience. Creative professionals and artists, who have long been loyal Apple customers, have expressed outrage online. The imagery of beloved creative tools being mercilessly crushed resonated deeply, stirring anxieties about the potential impact of AI on artistic expression and the future of physical tools in a digital age.\n\nApple's attempt to capitalize on the popular trend of \"oddly satisfying\" crushing videos backfired spectacularly. Instead of amusement, viewers felt a pang of loss as cherished objects were reduced to rubble. The ad's underlying message - that a single device can replace a multitude of traditional tools - alienated the very customers it aimed to impress.\n\nTim Cook's decision to share the ad on X only amplified the negative response. Thousands of comments flooded the platform, many from prominent artists like cartoonist James Kochalka, who criticized the ad's disrespect for the tools that fuel creative endeavors. Kochalka, echoing a common sentiment, highlighted the reverence artists hold for their instruments, emphasizing the importance of a \"healthy dialogue\" with them, rather than a ruthless replacement.\n\nBeyond the immediate outrage, this ad campaign exposes a deeper vulnerability for Apple. The company, once a scrappy innovator known for its user-friendly products, has transformed into a global tech behemoth. However, this growth seems to have come at a cost. The \"Crush!\" ad suggests a disconnect between Apple and its creative customer base.\n\nThis is not just another terrible advertisement. It erodes the wellspring of goodwill that Apple once possessed, which was established on the backs of creativity and user-centered design. The ad campaign has harmed Apple's image for encouraging innovation and alienated the very artists who have supported the business for years, rather than highlighting the iPad's possibilities. Apple has to figure out how to stay in touch with its core customer base and bring back the innovative spirit that once made the brand, all while navigating the challenges posed by its enormous scale.", "source": {"uri": "wonderfulengineering.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonderful Engineering"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaheer_shahzad@wonderfulengineering.com", "name": "Shaheer Shahzad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydraulic press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kochalka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Kochalka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartoonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User-centered design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Collectives", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Collectives", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-16.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550342", "eventUri": "eng-9550342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Crafted in-house, the controversial advertisement features a hydraulic press compressing various artistic tools -- from paintbrushes and musical instruments to film reels and cameras -- into the company's \"thinnest product yet.\"\n\nWhile the visual was meant to symbolize the device's capacity to unify diverse creative workflows into one streamlined gadget, it instead sparked a wave of backlash from the creative community and beyond.\n\nThe criticism was swift and sharp, with figures like Hugh Grant and Justine Bateman leading the charge. They, along with many others, interpreted the ad as suggesting that technology could be a destructive force, homogenizing and diminishing the value of traditional artistic expression -- especially in the age of artificial intelligence. The imagery of cherished creative tools being crushed into a piece of technology struck a nerve, with many seeing it as disrespectful to the rich legacy of these art forms.\n\nIn an email sent to DesignTAXI earlier, Apple's creative team explained that the crushing sequence was a metaphor highlighting the iPad Pro's ability to make creative processes more efficient. The company emphasized that the objects weren't being destroyed but were instead being transformed into a new, powerful form -- the iPad Pro itself.\n\nSet to the tune of Sonny & Cher's All I Ever Need is You, the commercial culminates in showcasing the iPad Pro as Apple's slimmest product packed with professional features and capabilities. To visually represent this, Apple chose to crush objects in an industrial-sized crusher, with each object selected not only for its visual appeal when compressed but also to narrate the versatility of the iPad Pro.\n\nThe film features apps like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro, alongside musical instruments and editing tools, while cans of paint and art supplies represented creative apps like Procreate and Adobe Fresco.

But why? - Softonic", "body": "The usual mechanics of Apple, year after year, you already know what it is: they announce a new model of a device that slightly improves on the previous one, launch a flashy ad, and wait for all their loyal customers to buy it. And repeat ad infinitum. The latest to fall has been the iPad Pro, which is born as the thinnest tablet on the market for those who care about such things. The problem has not been that, but the announcement to present it, which has been too destructive even for the company's fans.\n\nThe key to the announcement of the iPad was clear: everything fits in the tablet, from musical composition to WhatsApp. And, for this, its creatives have been inspired by these fascinating videos that TikTok occasionally recommends to you, in which a hydraulic press destroys all kinds of things. The problem is that this time what a very rich company has destroyed are cultural goods, and the bravado has not been well received precisely.\n\nThe hydraulic press breaks a trumpet, a piano, an arcade machine, several paint cans, a metronome, or a mixer table, among others, to press them into an iPad. And what Apple thought would be read as \"Everything is inside\", many have read it as \"The iPad wants to destroy art\" or simply as a crude way to destroy objects for promotional purposes that could instead be used by people with limited resources to create it.\n\nObviously, the problem comes from one of the biggest companies in the world wanting to enter a meme based on destroying things valued at thousands of euros as if it were just loose change for them. Personally, I don't think it's a big deal, it's just an advertisement, but I understand where all this is coming from: Apple has no right to make this kind of viral ads showing the obscene amount of money they can destroy just for fun. It's not the end of the apple company, far from it, but it is a gesture of disgust that would have been unthinkable years ago.

In order to convey that thinness, Apple did what any giant tech firm that secretly hates the weak, fleshy meat of the human race might do: Filmed a commercial in which they stuck basically every implement of human creativity to date under a crusher, utterly demolished it, and then displayed the new iPad as a suitable replacement for... all of it.\n\nAnd, look, the actual message of the ad isn't all that hard to parse, something along the lines of \"Look how we can fit all of human creativity into this tiny, very expensive package!,\" etc. But the decision to convey that idea by showing the destruction of so many outlets of expression for the human spirit -- presumably because, from a strictly aesthetic perspective, crushing shit in a giant crusher looks cool -- is a level of tone-deafness the company hasn't really exhibited in years. (Really, Apple? Nobody looked at the part where a human-shaped pose doll literally gets its back bent and broken by what you're doing to it and thought, \"Hmm, our message here might be getting a tad 'This is the hell the robots will make for us in 40 years'?\" No one voiced concerns with the close-up of an emoji representing the human face being demolished? You're the people who made the 1984 ad!)\n\nAnyway (per Deadline), a great many people, some of them famous, have already made fun of the \"Crush\" ad since it came out yesterday, including filmmaker Rezo Sixo Safai, who did a very clever job of reversing the ad to convey its actual message roughly a thousand times better than what was released.

Many, including myself, had a negative and visceral reaction to this, and we should talk about why.\n\nIt's not just because we are watching stuff get crushed. There are countless video channels dedicated to crushing, burning, exploding, and generally destroying everyday objects. Plus, of course, we all know that this kind of thing happens daily at transfer stations and recycling centers. So it isn't that.\n\nAnd it isn't that the stuff is itself so valuable. Sure, a piano is worth something. But we see them blown up in action movies all the time and don't feel bad. I like pianos, but that doesn't mean we can't do without a few disused baby grands. Same for the rest: It's mostly junk you could buy off Craigslist few bucks, or at a dump for free. (Maybe not the editing station.)\n\nThe problem isn't with the video itself, which in fairness to the people who staged and shot it, is actually very well done. The problem is not the media, but the message.\n\nWe all get the ad's ostensible point: You can do all this stuff in an iPad. Great. We could also do it on the last iPad, of course, but this one is thinner (no one asked for that, by the way; now cases won't fit) and some made-up percentage better.\n\nWhat we all understand, though, because unlike Apple ad executives we live in the world, is that the things being crushed here represent the material, the tangible, the real. And the real has value. Value that Apple clearly believes it can crush into yet another black mirror.\n\nThis belief is disgusting to me. And apparently to many others as well.\n\nDestroying a piano in a music video or Mythbusters episode is actually an act of creation. Even destroying a piano (or monitor, or paint can, or drum kit) for no reason at all is, at worst, wasteful!\n\nBut what Apple is doing is destroying these things to convince you that you don't need them -- all you need is the company's little device, which can do all that and more, and no need for annoying stuff like strings, keys, buttons, brushes or mixing stations.\n\nWe're all dealing with the repercussions of media moving wholesale toward the digital and always-online. In many ways, it's genuinely good! I think technology has been hugely empowering.\n\nBut in other, equally real ways, the digital transformation feels harmful and forced, a technotopian billionaire-approved vision of the future where every child has an AI best friend and can learn to play the virtual guitar on a cold glass screen.\n\nDoes your child like music? They don't need a harp, throw it in the dump. An iPad is good enough. Do they like to paint? Here, Apple Pencil, just as good as pens, watercolors, oils! Books? Don't make us laugh! Destroy them. Paper is worthless, use another screen. In fact, why not read in Apple Vision Pro, with even faker paper?\n\nWhat Apple seems to have forgotten is that it is the things in the real world -- the very things Apple destroyed -- that give the fake versions of those things value in the first place.\n\nA virtual guitar can't replace a real guitar; that's like thinking a book can replace its author.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can't value both, for different reasons. But the Apple ad sends the message that the future it wants doesn't have bottles of paint, dials to turn, sculpture, physical instruments, paper books.

Many, including myself, had a negative and visceral reaction to this, and we should talk about why.\n\n(Update: Apple has apologized for the ad and canceled plans to televise it. Apple's VP of Marketing Tor Myhren told Ad Age: \"We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.\" Apple declined to offer further comment to TechCrunch.)\n\nIt's not just because we are watching stuff get crushed. There are countless video channels dedicated to crushing, burning, exploding, and generally destroying everyday objects. Plus, of course, we all know that this kind of thing happens daily at transfer stations and recycling centers. So it isn't that.\n\nAnd it isn't that the stuff is itself so valuable. Sure, a piano is worth something. But we see them blown up in action movies all the time and don't feel bad. I like pianos, but that doesn't mean we can't do without a few disused baby grands. Same for the rest: It's mostly junk you could buy off Craigslist for a few bucks, or at a dump for free. (Maybe not the editing station.)\n\nThe problem isn't with the video itself, which in fairness to the people who staged and shot it, is actually very well done. The problem is not the media, but the message.\n\nWe all get the ad's ostensible point: You can do all this stuff in an iPad. Great. We could also do it on the last iPad, of course, but this one is thinner (no one asked for that, by the way; now cases won't fit) and some made-up percentage better.\n\nWhat we all understand, though -- because unlike Apple ad executives, we live in the world -- is that the things being crushed here represent the material, the tangible, the real. And the real has value. Value that Apple clearly believes it can crush into yet another black mirror.\n\nThis belief is disgusting to me. And apparently to many others, as well.\n\nDestroying a piano in a music video or Mythbusters episode is actually an act of creation. Even destroying a piano (or monitor, or paint can, or drum kit) for no reason at all is, at worst, wasteful!\n\nBut what Apple is doing is destroying these things to convince you that you don't need them -- all you need is the company's little device, which can do all that and more, and no need for annoying stuff like strings, keys, buttons, brushes or mixing stations.\n\nWe're all dealing with the repercussions of media moving wholesale toward the digital and always-online. In many ways, it's genuinely good! I think technology has been hugely empowering.\n\nBut in other, equally real ways, the digital transformation feels harmful and forced, a technotopian billionaire-approved vision of the future where every child has an AI best friend and can learn to play the virtual guitar on a cold glass screen.\n\nDoes your child like music? They don't need a harp; throw it in the dump. An iPad is good enough. Do they like to paint? Here, Apple Pencil, just as good as pens, watercolors, oils! Books? Don't make us laugh! Destroy them. Paper is worthless. Use another screen. In fact, why not read in Apple Vision Pro, with even faker paper?\n\nWhat Apple seems to have forgotten is that it is the things in the real world -- the very things Apple destroyed -- that give the fake versions of those things value in the first place.\n\nA virtual guitar can't replace a real guitar; that's like thinking a book can replace its author.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can't value both for different reasons. But the Apple ad sends the message that the future it wants doesn't have bottles of paint, dials to turn, sculpture, physical instruments, paper books. Of course, that's the future it's been working on selling us for years now, it just hadn't put it quite so bluntly before.\n\nWhen someone tells you who they are, believe them.

courtesy of Silicon Valley\".\n\nThe criticism is particularly pointed because of the concerns in many of the creative industries about artificial intelligence (AI) taking people's jobs.\n\nActor and film-maker Justine Bateman, a vocal critic of the use of AI in the film industry, said Apple's ad was \"crushing the arts.\"\n\nMulti-platinum selling songwriter Crispin Hunt called the act of destroying musical instruments evocative of burning books.\n\nThe comments underneath Mr Cook's post on X have been particularly negative, with one person calling it \"extremely distasteful\", and another saying it makes them feel \"ashamed to buy Apple products\".\n\nPeople based in Japan appear to be prominent amongst the critics, which some said \"lacked respect\".\n\n\"The act of destroying tools is arrogant and offensive to us Japanese,\" one person explained, while another said musicians value their instruments \"more than life itself\".\n\nThe video has also drawn unfavourable comparisons with one of Apple's most famous adverts, which aired in 1984.\n\nIn a nod to its year of release (and the novel by George Orwell), the ad depicts an athlete fighting back against a dystopian future.\n\nOne user said the new ad was \"almost quite literally the exact opposite\" of it, and another said it showed Apple had \"become the faceless culture crashing force they rallied against in 1984\".\n\nAnd for one person, it was \"a visual and metaphorical bookend\" to the original advert.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Created in-house and directed by Iconoclast's Vania & Muggia, the spot introduces Apple's thinnest product ever by placing a room full of analog creative objects in an industrial crusher.\n\nA metronome, guitar, piano, sculpture bust, paint cans and more get slowly flattened as a metaphor for all the tools and capabilities inside Apple's newest product. But in an age of AI, where machines threaten to flatten human creativity, the spot has drawn not just disdain but disgust -- with many calling it exactly the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. (Others, including agency Lafayette American, pointed out that the ad works better in reverse.)\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaking matters worse, it appears \"Crush\" isn't just a poorly considered metaphor, it's also not a new one. The spot is very similar to a 2008 U.K. ad (below) for an LG phone, which is still on YouTube 16 years later.\n\n\"Crush,\" which is airing on TV, social media, digital and YouTube, was quickly interpreted as having a sinister meaning by viewers, who responded under Tim Cook's X post with criticisms that it represented a desire to replace analog art and human connection with screens.\n\nPeople are also pointing out the 2008 LG spot, created by BBH London.\n\nCelebrities including Hugh Grant, Justine Bateman and \"Handmaid's Tale\" director Reed Morano, among others, have also chimed in (below).\n\nThere have been calls to pull the spot. But Apple does not typically bow to external pressure, and as of this writing, Cook's X post and the YouTube video are still live.

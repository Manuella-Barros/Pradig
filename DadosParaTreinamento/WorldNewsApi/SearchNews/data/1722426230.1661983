He was never not funny.\u201d She added that her father will be \u201cdeeply missed\u201d by all, including \u201cby many, many dogs\u201d. He landed the role of Colonel Mustard in the 1985 black-comedy movie Clue, inspired by the board game that shares the same name. 1990s television fans will recognise him from Roseanne, where he played the lead character\u2019s boss and best friend, Leon Carp.

The now 48-year-old actor posted an Instagram tribute to her blundering high school principal, Willard Kraft, and the man who played him for 73 episodes. \u201cRest in Peace, my friend. The incredible #MartinMull (Principal Kraft) has left us for his eternal rest,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have such fond memories of working with him and being in awe of his huge body of work, which before #SabrinaTheTeemageWitch included #Roseanne and #MrMom as the projects I knew him from.\u201d The former child star added that even after their time on Sabrina The Teenage Witch, the two actors kept running into each other on numerous TV sets throughout the years. She sympathised with his family at losing a \u201cwonderful man\u201d. \u201cHe was an artist who liked to paint and build things with his hands, a musician, and a wonderful man who I am better for knowing. He will be missed, but this world has benefited from his being here,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy deepest sympathies to his family and friends.\u201d Actor and Jennifer Tilly, who starred alongside Mull in the 1988 movie Rented Lips, also paid tribute to a man she remembered as \u201cwonderful\u201d. \u201cSo sad to hear of the passing of Martin Mull. I worked with him a long time ago on a film called Rented Lips that he wrote and also starred in,\u201d Tilly shared on X. \u201cHe was such a witty, charismatic and kind person. As an actress just starting out, it really meant a lot to me to be able to work with such a wonderful actor.\u201d Mull is survived by his daughter, Maggie, and wife, Wendy Haas.", "summary": "The sitcom veteran enjoyed a decades-long career that began in the 1970s.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/roseanne-family-guy-fox-jason-bateman-emmy-award-b1167599.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/29/05/02-5cc31e482e3141de87d51fc65b47be58.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:32:34", "author": "Rachel Vickers-Price", "authors": ["Rachel Vickers-Price"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.585}

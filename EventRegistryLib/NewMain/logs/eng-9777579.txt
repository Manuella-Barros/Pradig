Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nThe two governors were demonstrating a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns: Summertime auditions from vice presidential contenders who walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nVice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, appears intent on making a choice that she's comfortable with personally and that can expand her electoral appeal in a matter of days. Her campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nHarris' campaign said Tuesday that she and her running mate will begin traveling to battleground states next week. The stops will include Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, once held out as an ideal nominee if Biden bailed out, has said, more or less, that she's not a contender. But she appeared Monday with Shapiro in Pennsylvania and mused on MSNBC last week that \"two women on the ticket would be exciting.\"\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Republican Donald Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBack home in Frankfort recently, Beshear played down the importance of being from a battleground, saying, \"About every successful ticket going back to 2000 did not have someone in a swing state.\"\n\nOf course, sometimes the spotlight can produce mistakes. Twice in Georgia, Beshear mispronounced Harris' first name as \"Kah-MAH-lah,\" rather than the correct \"KAH-mah-lah.\"\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition for Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick in time for Democratic delegates to ratify her decision in a virtual nominating vote that could conclude by Aug. 7. Whatever her timetable, the media and campaign circuit is allowing plenty of Democrats additional time in the spotlight.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news",

JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House - and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" - and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district - a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\n___\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

AP\n\nDemocrat Josh Shapiro had a dual message for enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week, telling them Kamala Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminding them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nThe two governors were demonstrating a time-honoured tradition in presidential campaigns: Summertime auditions from vice presidential contenders who walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nVice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, appears intent on making a choice that she's comfortable with personally and that can expand her electoral appeal in a matter of days. Her campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nHarris' campaign said Tuesday that she and her running mate will begin travelling to battleground states next week. The stops will include Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, once held out as an ideal nominee if Biden bailed out, has said, more or less, that she's not a contender. But she appeared Monday with Shapiro in Pennsylvania and mused on MSNBC last week that \"two women on the ticket would be exciting.\"\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Republican Donald Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBack home in Frankfort recently, Beshear played down the importance of being from a battleground, saying, \"About every successful ticket going back to 2000 did not have someone in a swing state.\"\n\nOf course, sometimes the spotlight can produce mistakes. Twice in Georgia, Beshear mispronounced Harris' first name as \"Kah-MAH-lah,\" rather than the correct \"KAH-mah-lah.\"\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition for Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick in time for Democratic delegates to ratify her decision in a virtual nominating vote that could conclude by Aug. 7. Whatever her timetable, the media and campaign circuit is allowing plenty of Democrats additional time in the spotlight.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. &mldr; Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

VP pick likely to be announced soon", "body": "Democrat Josh Shapiro had a dual message for enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week, telling them Kamala Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminding them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nThe two governors were demonstrating a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns: Summertime auditions from vice presidential contenders who walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nVice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, appears intent on making a choice that she's comfortable with personally and that can expand her electoral appeal in a matter of days. Her campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThree people familiar with the vice president's plans said Tuesday that she and her yet-to-be-named running mate would begin traveling to battleground states next week -- suggesting that a decision could be coming soon. The people said they didn't know who her pick would be or which states Harris would visit, although one said Savannah, Georgia, was on the itinerary. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though: \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, once held out as an ideal nominee if Biden bailed out, has said, more or less, that she's not a contender. But she appeared Monday with Shapiro in Pennsylvania and mused on MSNBC last week that \"two women on the ticket would be exciting.\"\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Republican Donald Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBack home in Frankfort recently, Beshear played down the importance of being from a battleground, saying, \"About every successful ticket going back to 2000 did not have someone in a swing state.\"\n\nOf course, sometimes the spotlight can produce mistakes. Twice in Georgia, Beshear mispronounced Harris' first name as \"Kah-MAH-lah,\" rather than the correct \"KAH-mah-lah.\"\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives.

He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick in time for Democratic delegates to ratify her decision in a virtual nominating vote that could conclude by Aug. 7. Whatever her timetable, the media and campaign circuit is allowing plenty of Democrats additional time in the spotlight.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nThe two governors were demonstrating a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns: Summertime auditions from vice presidential contenders who walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nVice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, appears intent on making a choice that she's comfortable with personally and that can expand her electoral appeal in a matter of days. Her campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nHarris campaign officials said Tuesday that she and her yet-to-be-named running mate would begin traveling to battleground states next week -- suggesting that a decision could be coming soon. The campaign said that Harris has not made a decision on a running mate. Harris and her yet-to-be-named running mate will, however, travel to Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though: \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, once held out as an ideal nominee if Biden bailed out, has said, more or less, that she's not a contender. But she appeared Monday with Shapiro in Pennsylvania and mused on MSNBC last week that \"two women on the ticket would be exciting.\"\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Republican Donald Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBack home in Frankfort recently, Beshear played down the importance of being from a battleground, saying, \"About every successful ticket going back to 2000 did not have someone in a swing state.\"\n\nOf course, sometimes the spotlight can produce mistakes. Twice in Georgia, Beshear mispronounced Harris' first name as \"Kah-MAH-lah,\" rather than the correct \"KAH-mah-lah.\"\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition for Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick in time for Democratic delegates to ratify her decision in a virtual nominating vote that could conclude by Aug. 7. Whatever her timetable, the media and campaign circuit is allowing plenty of Democrats additional time in the spotlight.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNEW DETAILS: Deere offers statement on severance package for salaried employees let go Wednesday in Waterloo John Deere lays off more than 300 in Moline and East Moline in latest round of cuts Deere held employee meeting Wednesday, no word yet on potential layoffs for Quad-Cities Scenes from the course of the 2024 Quad-City Times Bix 7 BIX 7: Cartee, Boleyn up to the challenge of beating the elite Wesley Kiptoo and Rachael Chebet win 2024 Quad-City Times Bix 7 Arrowhead Ranch items up for online auction after facility's closure Northwest Bank acquired by Chicago-area bank 4-year-old boy escaped from cage in Iowa home; deputies found him covered in feces on street Azteca 3 in Bettendorf to remain open, reversing earlier decision First Senior Bix sees strong turnout ahead of 50th Quad-City Times Bix 7 New business coming to Davenport's former Bed Bath & Beyond Man charged with first-degree murder for 2023 fatal shooting in Davenport Davenport code enforcement officer quits after argument with boss over Wold-owned duplex BIX 7 HIGH SCHOOL CHALLENGE: Leitzen, Maloney top prep finishers\n\nHarris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nValparaiso University to eliminate 30 academic programs Davich: 'Mr. Safety' killed at dangerous bike trail intersection in Region Valpo jewelry store burglarized; holes cut in wall, cops say Mascot Hall of Fame to close in September, 'going out with confetti' Former U.S. Steel South Works site to be transformed into quantum computing park Pierogi Fest grew from one vendor who sold out in an hour to a wall-to-wall crush of starch-seeking revelers, expects record attendance UPDATE: Valpo woman identified as deceased in fatal U.S. 20 crash Davich: Frankly, this is the best hot dog joint in the Region Big Lots closing stores in Chicagoland and Indiana, warns it may close all stores Region police release photo of wanted man Police seek help identifying 2 captured on video following home invasion 24-Hour Pierogi People: Annual Whiting festival elevates the dumpling to an artform Gas prices spike over $4 a gallon in Northwest Indiana after storms cause refinery power outage NWI Business Ins and Outs: Cajun Express, Fuerte Restaurant, Frankie's Philly Steak, The Waxi Taxi, Phenix Salon Suites and Boot Barn opening Pastor seeks to dump video of him allegedly battering child\n\nHarris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor? He's got three.

Is trade only 1?\n\nHarris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ...

Gretchen Whitmer meets with attendees during campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nBy BILL BARROW, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nHarris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select.\n\nThose who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss.\n\nTo that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House -- and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president\" -- and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people.\n\nThe campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.\n\nHarris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, \"Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one.\" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nHarris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically.\n\nDems' VP list has notable differences\n\nShapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nLike all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades.\n\nBeshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in \"tough counties\" but emphasized liberal bona fides: \"I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor.\"\n\nClosest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. \"I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky - and I won it by 22 points last November,\" he said.\n\nBeshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district -- a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian.\n\n\"She will make the best choice she's going to,\" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. \"One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,\" Walz said, including \"a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president.\"\n\nKelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis.\n\nBut Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote.\n\nEveryone has an opinion\n\nWhile Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion.\n\nSteven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country.\n\nDonna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves \"a lot of noise\" that underplays the complexity of the decision.\n\n\"The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,\" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. \"It's worse than a dental hygiene check. ... Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.\"\n\nBarrow reported from Cumming, Georgia.

Harris and her vice presidential pick will embark on a battleground tour next week with stops in seven swing states from Pennsylvania to Nevada.\n\nHarris' decision to kick off the tour in Pennsylvania has triggered speculation that her VP might be Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state. According to Politico, Shapiro is one of the top contenders for the role that her team are vetting.\n\nDespite the speculation, Harris told reporters on Tuesday that she had not yet made a decision as to who she would select as her running mate. The outlet reported that Harris is to interview potential nominees in the upcoming days. Other names in the mix include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nShapiro (pictured) told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia earlier this week that he believes Harris belongs in the White House. He also reminded those who gathered of all his work as governor in the battleground state. While Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of 'a great president' and highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat.\n\nAccording to campaign sources, who spoke with the Associated Press, Shapiro and Kelly are among the front-runners. Harris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight. Shapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican.\n\nHe's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure. His allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nHarris is the only White House hopeful who has so far qualified to compete for the Democratic nominee, the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday. The DNC's announcement officially clears the path for the vice president to seek her party's nomination uncontested. During a rally on Tuesday, Harris pulled a line from rapper Quavo to try and turn the tables on Donald Trump for his criticism that she and President Biden have failed at the southern border. She called out her 2024 presidential rival at a campaign rally in Atlanta as 'not walking it like he talks it' on illegal immigration.\n\nWith the Migos rapper in attendance - along with raunchy 'Savage' performer Megan Thee Stallion - the vice president also pushed her Republican rival to commit to one or more debates rather than continue to publicly call her names, challenging him to 'say it to my face.'\n\nAfter statements from both performers, Harris attempted to turn the tables on the open borders argument by blaming Trump, leaning into her background as an attorney general in California, a state she was quick to remind attendees, shares a border with Mexico. 'I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally,' Harris said. 'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. 'Or as my friend Quavo would say, he's not walking it like he talks it,' she quickly added, in reference to the rapper's 2018 Migos hit, 'Walk It, Talk It.'\n\nTo bolster her point, Harris pointed to the prospective pressure Trump put on his Republican allies within the Senate this past January, when he reportedly told them to kill any border legislation that wasn't 'perfect.' Her comments appeared to come in reference to a recent ad being run by Trump's team, which focuses on Harris's questionable record when it comes immigration. She also referenced how Trump has called her 'crazy' and a '[expletive]' - criticisms she said would be better made face-to-face. 'I do hope you'll reconsider to [meeting] me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,' Harris, 59, said shortly after taking the podium. She went on to express her desire to win come November and unite the country in the process, while framing her conservative rival as a phony who 'does not care.' 'He only cares about himself,' she further claimed, vowing to revive the bipartisan border bill if elected.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.\n\nHis allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nHarris is the only White House hopeful who has so far qualified to compete fro the Democratic nominee, the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday.\n\nThe DNC's announcement officially clears the path for the vice president to seek her party's nomination uncontested.\n\nDuring a rally on Tuesday, Harris pulled a line from rapper Quavo to try and turn the tables on Donald Trump for his criticism that she and President Biden have failed at the southern border.\n\nShe called out her 2024 presidential rival at a campaign rally in Atlanta as 'not walking it like he talks it' on illegal immigration.\n\nDuring a rally on Tuesday, Harris pulled a line from rapper Quavo to try and turn the tables on Donald Trump\n\nHarris dropped a reference to the rapper's 2018 Migos hit, 'Walk It, Talk It', Quavo is seen here at the event\n\nWith the Migos rapper in attendance - along with raunchy 'Savage' performer Megan Thee Stallion - the vice president also pushed her Republican rival to commit to one or more debates rather than continue to publicly call her names, challenging him to 'say it to my face.'\n\nAfter statements from both performers, Harris attempted to turn the tables on the open borders argument by blaming Trump, leaning into her background as an attorney general in California, a state she was quick to remind attendees, shares a border with Mexico.\n\n'I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally,' Harris said.\n\n'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.\n\n'Or as my friend Quavo would say, he's not walking it like he talks it,' she quickly added, in reference to the rapper's 2018 Migos hit, 'Walk It, Talk It.'\n\nTo bolster her point, Harris pointed to the prospective pressure Trump put on his Republican allies within the Senate this past January, when he reportedly told them to kill any border legislation that wasn't 'perfect.'\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is seen here performing at the Kamala Harris Campaign Rally on Tuesday in Atlanta\n\nHer comments appeared to come in reference to a recent ad being run by Trump's team, which focuses on Harris's questionable record when it comes immigration.\n\nShe also referenced how Trump has called her 'crazy' and a 'bum' - criticisms she said would be better made face-to-face.\n\n'I do hope you'll reconsider to [meeting] me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,' Harris, 59, said shortly after taking the podium.\n\nShe went on to express her desire to win come November and unite the country in the process, while framing her conservative rival as a phony who 'does not care.'\n\n'He only cares about himself,' she further claimed, vowing to revive the bipartisan border bill if elected.", "source": {"uri":

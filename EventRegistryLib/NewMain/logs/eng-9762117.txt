Stakely was hit and killed while trying to stop her vehicle from being stolen with her 6-year-old son inside.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- All three suspects wanted in connection with the death of Alexa Stakely, an Ohio mom struck while trying to prevent the theft of her vehicle with her 6-year-old son inside, have been taken into custody, authorities said Wednesday evening.\n\nA 16-year-old male whom police say admitted he was driving Stakely's vehicle turned himself in and is being charged with delinquency murder in Franklin County Juvenile court, Columbus police said. The second male, 17, was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network, is not naming the two minors.\n\nA third male, Gerald Dowling, 19, turned himself in Wednesday night, according to Columbus police. Authorities later confirmed that Dowling was charged with murder.\n\nPolice said the 17-year-old male admitted to detectives that he was present during the attempted theft of Stakely's vehicle. Additional details regarding what he would be charged with were not immediately available Wednesday.\n\nThe 16-year-old, accompanied by his parents, surrendered himself at Columbus police headquarters and agreed to an interview with detectives, authorities said. The teen later told detectives that he and the two other acquaintances were looking for a vehicle to steal around 1:30 a.m. on July 11 when they came across Stakely's Honda.\n\nWhat happened to Alexa Stakely?\n\nStakely, 29, a single mother who was a speech-language pathologist for Winchester Trail Elementary School in Canal Winchester, Ohio, also had a part-time job as a waitress to support her son. She was picking her son up after a waitressing shift.\n\nStakely brought the sleeping boy out to her Honda CRV, which she left running, while she met the babysitter in the doorway to get the boy's belongings, police said.\n\nAs Stakely returned to her vehicle, she saw someone inside beginning to back out onto the road. Stakely ran out toward the Honda and was heard screaming for her child and telling the driver to stop, police said.\n\nAs his two friends watched, the 16-year-old told detectives he got into Stakely's vehicle and was about to drive off when Stakely ran out to stop him. Police said the teen told detectives that he panicked and began driving off, striking Stakely with her vehicle.\n\nPolice said the Honda hit Stakely and she was knocked to the pavement, suffering a \"fatal wound\" to her head. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nThe 16-year-old abandoned the Honda within the same complex. Witnesses saw two males running north, past where Stakely was on the ground, jumping a fence and escaping into a neighboring apartment complex, police said. The three regrouped a short time later on foot, police said.\n\nStakely's son was recovered uninjured and told police he slept through the attempted carjacking.\n\n'She was my best friend'\n\nMore than 100 people gathered near Winchester Trail Elementary School last week to pay tribute to the young single mother. Stakely's friends and colleagues said she aspired to own a home and business. Those who knew her said she was loyal to her friends and family and loved her son \"fiercely.\n\nStakely's brother, Braedyn Price, also attended the vigil. Price, 21, said that he woke up at 4 a.m. on July 11 to a phone call saying that his sister, best friend, and mentor, Alexa, had been hit by a car. He said he initially didn't believe it and then thought she had suffered some moderate injuries but that she'd recover.\n\n\"And the next thing I knew, I was looking over her body,\" Price said. \"It's still very hard for me to grasp.\"\n\nPrice said that since his sister's passing, he just feels \"empty\" and that he's had trouble sleeping. He also said that he is angry at the people who are responsible for her death.\n\n\"She was an amazing human and my best friend,\" Price said.\n\nViolent carjackings in the U.S.\n\nCarjackings have significantly increased in some U.S. cities since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Council on Criminal Justice. Carjackings surged by 93% in 10 cities from 2019 to 2023 and while the figure fell by 5% in 2023, data showed that the rate of carjackings was still high compared to years before 2020.\n\nThe rise in carjacking rates -- along with other violent crimes -- have prompted authorities, including in the nation's capital, to provide more resources and crackdown on crime.\n\nSince 1992, federal, state, and local authorities have tried to toughen carjacking laws in response to spates of violent carjackings -- including some incidents in which victims were murdered. One incident is credited to have prompted a federal response.\n\nIn September 1992, Pamela Basu, 34, was dragged to her death after two carjackers pushed her out of her vehicle while she was at a stop sign. Basu was driving her 2-year-old daughter to her first day of preschool.\n\nDuring the incident, Basu's arm got caught in a seatbelt and she was dragged for one and a half miles after she attempted to reach for her daughter in the back seat, according to The New York Times Archives. The two perpetrators were convicted of murder and other charges.\n\nThe murder of Basu shocked the country and outraged members of Congress, according to a North Carolina Central Law Review article. Congress quickly passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 and former President George H. W. Bush signed it into law in October 1992.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbus_Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Columbus Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile delinquency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda CR-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Winchester,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Central University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Judge Bill Hedrick set Dowling's bond at $10 million.\n\nDowling did not appear in person. A grand jury will review the case for possible indictment.\n\nA 16-year-old boy, whom police say admitted he was driving Alexa Stakely's vehicle, turned himself in and is being charged with delinquency murder in Franklin County Juvenile court, police said. A second teenage boy was taken into custody later Wednesday afternoon and is also charged with delinquency murder.\n\nThe Dispatch is not naming the two juveniles at this time.\n\nThe third suspect, Dowling, of Dublin, surrendered later in the evening and has been charged with murder, according to a Columbus police spokesperson.\n\nColumbus police said the 16-year-old told one of his parents he was involved in Stakely's death, and his parents immediately contacted police and accompanied him to surrender himself at police headquarters Downtown.\n\nThe teen agreed to an interview with detectives, police said. He revealed that he and two other acquaintances were looking for a vehicle to steal around 1:30 a.m. July 11 when they came across Stakely's running Honda in the 6300 block of Blue Knoll Drive at the White Oak Park Condominiums, according to police.\n\nStakely killed while trying to prevent vehicle from being stolen\n\nStakely, a single mother who was a speech-language pathologist for Winchester Trail Elementary School in the Canal Winchester Local Schools, also had a part-time job as a waitress to support her son.

Stakely ran out toward the Honda and was heard screaming for her child and telling the driver to stop, police said.\n\nAs his two friends watched, the 16-year-old told detectives he got into Stakely's vehicle and was about to drive off when Stakely ran out to stop him. Police said the teen told detectives that he panicked, and as he was driving off, he struck Stakely with her vehicle.\n\nPolice said Stakely was knocked to the pavement, suffering a \"fatal wound\" to her head. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nThe 16-year-old abandoned the Honda within the same complex. Witnesses saw two males running north, past where Stakely was on the ground, jumping a fence and escaping into a neighboring apartment complex, police said. The three regrouped a short time later on foot, police said.\n\nStakely's son was recovered uninjured and told police he slept through the attempted carjacking.\n\nAccording to police, the second juvenile admitted to detectives that he was present during the attempted theft of Stakely's vehicle.", "source": {"uri": "zanesvilletimesrecorder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coshocton Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile delinquency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_court_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State court (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickerington,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickerington, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pickerington, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispatch_(Lexington)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dispatch (Lexington)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Park,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Park, Illinois"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda CR-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Winchester,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/12/NCOD/74385545007-stakely.jpg?auto=webp&crop=528,297,x0,y64&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762117", "eventUri": "eng-9762117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1654, "textEnd": 1661}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 238, "relevance": 1}

The three regrouped a short time later on foot, police said.\n\nStakely's son was recovered uninjured and told police he slept through the attempted carjacking.\n\nMore than 100 people gathered near Winchester Trail Elementary School last week to pay tribute to the young single mother. Stakely's friends and colleagues said she aspired to own a home and business. Those who knew her said she was loyal to her friends and family and loved her son \"fiercely.\n\nStakely's brother, Braedyn Price, also attended the vigil. Price, 21, said that he woke up at 4 a.m. on July 11 to a phone call saying that his sister, best friend, and mentor, Alexa, had been hit by a car. He said he initially didn't believe it and then thought she had suffered some moderate injuries but that she'd recover.\n\n\"And the next thing I knew, I was looking over her body,\" Price said. \"It's still very hard for me to grasp.\"\n\nPrice said that since his sister's passing, he just feels \"empty\" and that he's had trouble sleeping. He also said that he is angry at the people who are responsible for her death.\n\n\"She was an amazing human and my best friend,\" Price said.\n\nCarjackings have significantly increased in some U.S. cities since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Council on Criminal Justice. Carjackings surged by 93% in 10 cities from 2019 to 2023 and while the figure fell by 5% in 2023, data showed that the rate of carjackings was still high compared to years before 2020.\n\nThe rise in carjacking rates -- along with other violent crimes -- have prompted authorities, including in the nation's capital, to provide more resources and crackdown on crime.\n\nSince 1992, federal, state, and local authorities have tried to toughen carjacking laws in response to spates of violent carjackings -- including some incidents in which victims were murdered. One incident is credited to have prompted a federal response.\n\nIn September 1992, Pamela Basu, 34, was dragged to her death after two carjackers pushed her out of her vehicle while she was at a stop sign. Basu was driving her 2-year-old daughter to her first day of preschool.\n\nDuring the incident, Basu's arm got caught in a seatbelt and she was dragged for one and a half miles after she attempted to reach for her daughter in the back seat, according to The New York Times Archives. The two perpetrators were convicted of murder and other charges.\n\nThe murder of Basu shocked the country and outraged members of Congress, according to a North Carolina Central Law Review article. Congress quickly passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 and former President George H. W. Bush signed it into law in October 1992.\n\nContact Shahid Meighan at smeighan@dispatch.com or on X @ShahidMeighan", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbus_Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Columbus Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile delinquency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda CR-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Winchester,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Central University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Investigators say the mother was chasing her car as it still had her six-year-old son inside.\n\nAfter almost two weeks of searching for the suspects, a 16-year-old boy was accompanied by his parents on Wednesday to the Columbus Police Headquarters and agreed to be interviewed by detectives.\n\nWhile being questioned, the teenager admitted to stealing Stakely's Honda and causing her death, then was subsequently arrested and charged with murder, according to a media release from the Columbus Division of Police.\n\nThe 16-year-old told the Columbus police that he and two friends were looking for a vehicle to steal when they spotted the single mother's Honda.\n\nWhile the two friends watched, the teenager got into Stakely's car and was about to drive off when the mother appeared in front of her Honda, police said.\n\nThe teen then claimed that he \"panicked and began to drive off, striking Stakely with her own vehicle,\" the release stated.\n\nStakely was found by officers lying in the roadway suffering from traumatic injuries before she was transported to hospital and pronounced dead, the police stated.\n\nThe suspect told police that after the incident, he abandoned the Honda and rejoined his two friends on foot.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the first teen, a second juvenile suspect was identified and interviewed by police, where he admitted to being present with a third party during the theft of the Honda, the police said in a social media update.\n\nThis suspect has also been charged with murder. The Independent is not naming the two juveniles at this time.\n\nA third male, and the only adult of the group, 19-year-old Gerald Dowling Jr, turned himself in later on Wednesday night, according to The Columbus Dispatch.\n\nFranklin County Jail records show Dowling, who was arrested Wednesday, as having also been charged with murder.\n\nDowling had his first court appearance on Thursday at the Franklin County Municipal Court, where he was given a bond set at $10m.\n\nOn 11 July, Stakely had picked her son, Deluca, up from an apartment complex on the Southeast Side of Columbus around 1.30 pm.\n\nAfter putting her son in her Honda SUV, realized she'd forgotten something from the babysitter.\n\nShe went back to the babysitter's home and left the car running. When the woman returned to her SUV, she noticed it backing out of the driveway. According to The Columbus Dispatch, she ran after the car while yelling for her son before she was hit by the vehicle.\n\nAn officer with the Columbus Police Department found the SUV with the woman's son asleep in the backseat nearby. The boy said he didn't see who was driving because he was asleep.\n\nInvestigators said witnesses noticed two men running from the area where the woman had been hit. They then jumped a fence and ran into a neighboring apartment complex as the woman was on the ground.\n\nBased on surveillance footage obtained by police, a group of men were looking into apartments a block away from where the incident happened. The description of the men looking into apartments matched that of the suspects who ran from the car after the woman was hit.\n\nStakely worked as a speech pathologist for Canal Winchester Local Schools and as a waitress to support her son.\n\nA GoFundMe has been created to help support the woman's son. As of Thursday, it had surpassed its $15,000 goal and raised $93,000. The woman's son is being taken care of by family members, police said.\n\nThe friend who created the post described her as \"a coffee addict\" who \"loved anything with salt on it and had a soft spot for trash TV.\"\n\n\"She was incredibly smart and sassy in the best way. She will be incredibly missed by the people's lives she touched,' the page read.\n\nBefore the suspects turned themselves in, Sergeant James Fuqua said, \"They know what they did,\" adding he doesn't believe the men intended to kill the woman.\n\nIf you have any information on the identity of the suspect, please call Detective Lemmon at 614-645-2558 or the Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at 614-461-8477.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Division_of_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Division of Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbus_Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Columbus Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_court_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State court (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime Stoppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Winchester,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9bb0e3e5690d244e713097666590df37", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762117", "eventUri": "eng-9762117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 2277, "textEnd": 2284}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Investigators say the mother was chasing her car as it still had her six-year-old son inside.\n\nAfter almost two weeks of searching for the suspects, a 16-year-old boy was accompanied by his parents on Wednesday to the Columbus Police Headquarters and agreed to be interviewed by detectives.\n\nWhile being questioned, the teenager admitted to stealing Stakely's Honda and causing her death, then was subsequently arrested and charged with murder, according to a media release from the Columbus Division of Police.\n\nThe 16-year-old told the Columbus police that he and two friends were looking for a vehicle to steal when they spotted the single mother's Honda.\n\nWhile the two friends watched, the teenager got into Stakely's car and was about to drive off when the mother appeared in front of her Honda, police said.\n\nThe teen then claimed that he \"panicked and began to drive off, striking Stakely with her own vehicle,\" the release stated.\n\nStakely was found by officers lying in the roadway suffering from traumatic injuries before she was transported to hospital and pronounced dead, the police stated.\n\nThe suspect told police that after the incident, he abandoned the Honda and rejoined his two friends on foot.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the first teen, a second juvenile suspect was identified and interviewed by police, where he admitted to being present with a third party during the theft of the Honda, the police said in a social media update.\n\nThis suspect has also been charged with murder. The Independent is not naming the two juveniles at this time.\n\nA third male, and the only adult of the group, 19-year-old Gerald Dowling Jr, turned himself in later on Wednesday night, according to The Columbus Dispatch.\n\nFranklin County Jail records show Dowling, who was arrested Wednesday, as having also been charged with murder.\n\nDowling had his first court appearance on Thursday at the Franklin County Municipal Court, where he was given a bond set at $10m.\n\nOn 11 July, Stakely had picked her son, Deluca, up from an apartment complex on the Southeast Side of Columbus around 1.30 pm.\n\nAfter putting her son in her Honda SUV, realized she'd forgotten something from the babysitter.\n\nShe went back to the babysitter's home and left the car running. When the woman returned to her SUV, she noticed it backing out of the driveway. According to The Columbus Dispatch, she ran after the car while yelling for her son before she was hit by the vehicle.\n\nAn officer with the Columbus Police Department found the SUV with the woman's son asleep in the backseat nearby. The boy said he didn't see who was driving because he was asleep.\n\nInvestigators said witnesses noticed two men running from the area where the woman had been hit. They then jumped a fence and ran into a neighboring apartment complex as the woman was on the ground.\n\nBased on surveillance footage obtained by police, a group of men were looking into apartments a block away from where the incident happened. The description of the men looking into apartments matched that of the suspects who ran from the car after the woman was hit.\n\nStakely worked as a speech pathologist for Canal Winchester Local Schools and as a waitress to support her son.\n\nA GoFundMe has been created to help support the woman's son. As of Thursday, it had surpassed its $15,000 goal and raised $93,000. The woman's son is being taken care of by family members, police said.\n\nThe friend who created the post described her as \"a coffee addict\" who \"loved anything with salt on it and had a soft spot for trash TV.\"\n\n\"She was incredibly smart and sassy in the best way. She will be incredibly missed by the people's lives she touched,' the page read.\n\nBefore the suspects turned themselves in, Sergeant James Fuqua said, \"They know what they did,\" adding he doesn't believe the men intended to kill the woman.\n\nIf you have any information on the identity of the suspect, please call Detective Lemmon at 614-645-2558 or the Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at 614-461-8477.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Division_of_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Division of Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbus_Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Columbus Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_court_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State court (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime Stoppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Winchester,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canal Winchester, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/15/Screenshot-2024-07-25-152903.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762117", "eventUri": "eng-9762117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 2486, "textEnd": 2493}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Ayden Beeson vanished beneath the surface of Rathburn Lake in Centerville more than an hour before rescue teams found his body, officials said. The 17-year-old swimmer \u201cwent under the water and had not resurfaced,\u201d according to the Appanoose County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The boy\u2019s body was found at 7:33 p.m. in 15 to 20 feet of water. He was pronounced dead at the scene. While police did not identify the teen, Centerville Community Schools confirmed it was Beeson, who was crowned prom king before graduating from Centerville High School in May. Despite achieving quintessential high school popularity, the football and tennis player was well known in the community as a \u201cgenuinely kind person who treated every student and staff member with respect.\u201d \u201cOn top of being a great athlete his best quality was him just being him,\u201d Beeson\u2019s tennis coach Tyler Baze wrote on Facebook. \u201cAyden was the kid every teacher and coach loves, he was such a kind and compassionate kid and gave you everything he had in the classroom and field/court! I\u2019m am thankful for getting the opportunity to know such a person. Centerville High School reopened its doors this week to offer counseling to grieving friends and dozens gathered at the football field where the teenager once played for a prayer vigil. The school district also shared an emblem to its social media channels reading \u201cBe like Beeson #20,\u201d in reference to his jersey number. The circumstances surrounding his drowning are still under investigation.", "summary": "A recent high school grad and prom king tragically drowned in an Iowa lake Wednesday.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/us-news/iowa-prom-king-ayden-beeson-drowns-during-summer-swim-weeks-after-graduating/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-5aze6uck5-1719633738333.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719619402&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gFOBCrxt-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:11:36", "author": "Katherine Donlevy", "authors": ["Katherine Donlevy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.307}

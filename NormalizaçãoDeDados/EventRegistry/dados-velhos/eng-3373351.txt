Later that year, a Boeing 737-500 was impounded by South African authorities after the airline failed to pay a $500 000 debt, the African Independent reported.\n\nIn April, all five Air Zimbabwe planes operating in South Africa were grounded when it was declared not airworthy.\n\nIn May, the airline was banned from flying to Europe over safety concerns.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373351", "time": "16:06:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373351", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}, "concepts": [{"id": "247", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "249", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "44945", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "45587", "label": {"eng": "Sandton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandton", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sandton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "45619", "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "45798", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "164424", "label": {"eng": "Cape Town"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Town"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302694", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "score": 3}, {"id": "302706", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Aircraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft", "score": 4}, {"id": "302715", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "score": 5}, {"id": "312659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Flag carrier"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier", "score": 1}, {"id": "319767", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "score": 5}, {"id": "320632", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grace Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Mugabe", "score": 2}, {"id": "320635", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe", "score": 4}, {"id": "324272", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Civil Aviation Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "328053", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of South Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_South_Africa", "score": 2}, {"id": "329949", "label": {"eng": "Southern African Development Community"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "336812", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boeing 767"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767", "score": 1}, {"id": "337902", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Air Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Zimbabwe", "score": 5}, {"id": "351304", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Presidents of Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Zimbabwe", "score": 2}, {"id": "464781", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "South African Civil Aviation Authority"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Civil_Aviation_Authority", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5520/f915bb819d2f492595e0b0adf9189e68.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:06:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "SAA suspends all Saturday flights between SA and Zimbabwe", "originalArticle": null}

All Air Zimbabwe operated flights will not be allowed to land or take off through any airports within the country.\n\nTonight's scheduled flight, due to take off at 18:55 was initially delayed, before being denied permission to take off altogether.\n\nAccording to sources in Harare, Zimbabwe's Civil Aviation Authority is expected to return the favour by banning all South African Airways flights into the country.\n\nAt present, SAA operates flights to Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria falls. All these flights would be affected.\n\nAt the time of writing, it remains unclear if President Robert Mugabe's UM1 plane will be affected by the ban. Mugabe's plane is chartered and operated by Air Zimbabwe.\n\nAviation experts have stated that it is improbable that Mugabe's plane would be grounded as well, as it is not a scheduled flight nor a commercial plane, but a private charter.\n\n\"It may be like when CAAZ banned Fly Africa. Fly Africa chartered a plane to service all passengers who had paid tickets. Its not exactly the same, but with regards to the UM1 being a private charter, it probably means Mugabe will be fine\", a source within SACAA stated. Air Zimbabwe is operated by Mugabe's son in-law, Simba Chikore, who despite being the Chief Operations Officer, now runs the airline as a de facto owner. He recently spearheaded a project aimed at rescuing the airline, acquiring planes from Malaysia and renaming the airline Zimbabwe Airways.\n\nIt has been a case of the more things change the more things stay the same however. The airline has remained woeful.\n\nThis is not the first time the embattled national airline has been grounded. In April this year, the entire airline's fleet was grounded.

The Wednesday request is being considered, officials said. On Friday, the state-owned Airports Co. of South Africa blocked an evening Air Zimbabwe flight to Harare after authorities asked for the airline's foreign operators permit.\n\n\"They also imposed similar decisions on us yesterday and an Air Zimbabwe plane was grounded,\" Joram Gumbo, Zimbabwe's transport minister, said by phone on Saturday. \"We've also taken a similar decision, in line with international practices, but we hope that the issue will be resolved soon.\"\n\nSAA has activated recovery plans with every effort being made to assist hundreds of stranded passengers, spokesman Tlali Tlali said by text message. In an interview on SABC television he said the costs of the canceled flights couldn't yet be calculated. The dispute led to cancellation of flights by Johannesburg-based Comair Ltd.\n\nSouth Africa Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi plans to meet with aviation agencies soon to discuss the grounding of the Zimbabwe flight, which failed to comply with rules for producing the foreign operating permit, his office said.\n\nThe grounding of planes is a \"diplomatic impasse\" over the assault charges against Grace Mugabe, the Democratic Alliance, a South African opposition party, said in an emailed statement. \"It seems that tensions between Zimbabwe and South Africa are mounting. The Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba must urgently and publicly address these concerning incidents and confirm that the SAA passengers and crew in Zimbabwe are safe.\"\n\nComair, which operates between South Africa and Zimbabwe under a franchise agreement with British Airways, also stopped its Saturday flights.\n\n\"We have learnt that there is a possibility of South African operated airlines being grounded in Zimbabwe and as a precautionary measure have decided to temporarily suspend our services to the country while the matter is being resolved by the authorities,\" according to an emailed company statement.\n\nSAA asked the South African government for 10 billion rand ($760 million), as part of a recapitalization plan aimed at returning it to profit, the finance chief said last month. The airline has failed to make a profit since 2011 and this month said it's in a liquidity crisis because it's trying to meet its debt obligations. - Bloomberg", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373351", "time": "17:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373351", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "247", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "249", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "44945", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "45798", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302694", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "score": 3}, {"id": "304516", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "British Airways"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways", "score": 2}, {"id": "305069", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "South African Broadcasting Corporation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation", "score": 3}, {"id": "315979", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "South African Airways"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Airways", "score": 4}, {"id": "317455", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "South African rand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand", "score": 1}, {"id": "320632", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grace Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Mugabe", "score": 2}, {"id": "320635", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe", "score": 3}, {"id": "328053", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of South Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_South_Africa", "score": 1}, {"id": "337902", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Air Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Zimbabwe", "score": 5}, {"id": "342517", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Zimbabwe", "score": 4}, {"id": "345788", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Malusi Gigaba"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malusi_Gigaba", "score": 2}, {"id": "426365", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic immunity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "17:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Zimbabwe and South Africa ground flights in permit dispute", "originalArticle": null}

Both countries said they imposed restrictions because planes did not have a \"foreign operator's permit.\"\n\nSouth Africa's government, meanwhile, said it had not yet decided whether to grant the Zimbabwe government's request for diplomatic immunity for Grace Mugabe, who has not commented on the allegations against her. The outspoken wife of President Robert Mugabe has been criticized for a fiery temper and lavish shopping expeditions, but her rising political profile has some asking whether she is maneuvering to succeed her husband.\n\nThere was no sign of Grace Mugabe at a regional summit that Zimbabwe's 93-year-old president attended Saturday in South Africa's capital, Pretoria.\n\nTwenty-year-old model Gabriella Engels has claimed that Grace Mugabe on Sunday night whipped her with an extension cord, cutting her forehead. Lawyers for Engels have threatened to go to court if immunity is granted.\n\nForeign ministry spokesman Nelson Kgwete said in a text message to The Associated Press that South Africa was still considering the request. \"Decision yet to be made,\" Kgwete said.\n\nSouth African police have issued a \"red alert\" at borders to ensure Grace Mugabe doesn't leave undetected. Police also say their investigation is complete but needs a government decision on the immunity appeal.\n\nState-owned South African Airways said Zimbabwe had placed restrictions on its operations. A flight from Zimbabwe's capital to Johannesburg was unable to take off Saturday morning, and another flight from Johannesburg to Harare was canceled.\n\nSouth African Airways said Zimbabwean authorities were demanding a foreign operator's permit, something that had never been required in the more than two decades the airline has been flying to and from neighboring Zimbabwe.\n\nThe airline's statement did not mention the allegations against Zimbabwe's first lady.\n\nDavid Chawota, head of the civil aviation authority in Zimbabwe, did not specify the \"issues\" requiring attention. \"The South Africans know what should be done in terms of processes,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, the South African Civil Aviation Authority said an inspection conducted Friday evening on an Air Zimbabwe Boeing 767-200 aircraft found it did not have a foreign operator's permit, and the operator was instructed \"not to take off until such time that there is full compliance\" with aviation guidelines.\n\nThe scandal over Grace Mugabe is a sensitive issue for South Africa as it weighs the possible diplomatic fallout from Zimbabwe if it acts against the first lady - and the likely outrage at home if it grants immunity and allows her to leave.

Our airline, as many others, does not have this particular document which has been a requirement for decades, but has never been issued to us.\"\n\nThe particular long haul B767 is said to be Air Zimbabwe's most reliable aircraft presently. Another B767 in its fleet is due for service while its B737 has been blacklisted for \"noise pollution\". An MA60 is currently used on the domestic routes.\n\nAn inspection report accompanying the Air Zimbabwe statement showed that the airline ticked all the boxes for the fitness of its aircraft, but SACAA inspectors had added, by pen, a new requirement for a foreign operators permit - which the airline was unable to produce.\n\nAll airports in the world require the same type of permit, which is issued by the civil aviation authority of that particular country. Air Zimbabwe officials say they have not been issued one for at least a decade, and the South Africans had never insisted on it until Friday - raising suspicions that the real target of their actions was Grace Mugabe.\n\nAir Zimbabwe officials say they believe the decision to ban their aircraft from South Africa was made by overzealous junior staffers.\n\nSaid one senior executive: \"We believe this decision to ground Air Zimbabwe, coming late on a Friday when offices that issue this particular permit are closed, is deliberate but one that has been taken at low level management.\n\n\"We'll engage the South Africans for a speedy resolution of this matter.\"\n\nPresident Mugabe is not due back in Harare until at least after Sunday, when the two-day SADC Heads of State summit ends.\n\nIt remains unclear if the South Africans will release the aircraft for his flight home.\n\nThe same aircraft assumes the call sign UM1 when chartered by Mugabe, a technicality which could be used to get it released for repositioning at Waterkloof military airbase from where Mugabe is expected to take-off.\n\nThe actions by the South Africans could boomerang, with officials at the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe reportedly considering grounding South African Airways and South Africa Airlink aircraft in retaliation. SAA makes at least six flights to Zimbabwean destinations daily, carrying over a 1,000 passengers.\n\nThe grounding of South African aircraft would be an unprecedented escalation of the crisis, with potential to trigger a diplomatic incident without parallel in the modern history of the two neighbours.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:44:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373351", "time": "10:44:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373351", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "247", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "249", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "44945", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "45619", "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302694", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "score": 5}, {"id": "302706", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Aircraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft", "score": 5}, {"id": "302716", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Airport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "score": 2}, {"id": "303539", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "305319", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "305553", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "score": 3}, {"id": "308912", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "score": 2}, {"id": "319767", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "score": 4}, {"id": "320632", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grace Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Mugabe", "score": 3}, {"id": "320635", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Mugabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe", "score": 3}, {"id": "324355", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "score": 2}, {"id": "328511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "score": 5}, {"id": "329949", "label": {"eng": "Southern African Development Community"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "336812", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boeing 767"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767", "score": 5}, {"id": "337902", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Air Zimbabwe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Zimbabwe", "score": 5}, {"id": "377557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National aviation authority"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_aviation_authority", "score": 4}, {"id": "403183", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "O.

The Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba must urgently and publicly address these concerning incidents and confirm that the SAA passengers and crew in Zimbabwe are safe.\"\n\nSAA asked the South African government for 10 billion rand ($760 million), as part of a recapitalization plan aimed at returning it to profit, Gigaba said last month.

Below are excerpts of the interview.\n\nBM: Minister, can you please explain the cause of the stand-off between the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (Caaz) and Sacaa that has resulted in the banning of Air Zimbabwe and South African Airways (SAA) flights between the two countries?\n\nJG: There is what is called operator's licence which is renewed periodically.\n\nSo Air Zimbabwe had not renewed its licence and South Africa Airways had also not renewed its own licence.\n\nSo what happened is that South Africa triggered the issue because they were the first to ground the Air Zimbabwe plane because of the non-compliance issue.\n\nBM: This compliance, is it a political issue between Zimbabwe and South Africa which is degenerating into a diplomatic tiff?\n\nJG: It's international compliance in line with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\n\nIt's not anything that you can say there is a fight between Caaz and the Civil Aviation Authority of South Africa. But it's just because airlines should comply with that requirement. Both airlines had not complied.\n\nBM: So can we safely say South Africa targeted a Zimbabwean plane?\n\nJG: South Africa started grounding planes last week. It actually grounded other planes from other international airlines, which had not yet renewed their permits.\n\nSo they grounded Air Zimbabwe on Friday when SAA had also not renewed its permits. So they [Caaz] grounded theirs as well. That is the issue. It's not anything serious.\n\nBM: Should we say there is nothing serious when passengers are stranded?\n\nJG: Airlines should just comply with that requirement.\n\nBM: Why had Air Zimbabwe not complied?\n\nJG: That's what I am saying. It's just a lapse by people in management. It's not only air Zimbabwe, I am telling you that other airlines were grounded in South Africa and you are just being specific with Air Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Africa has also not complied and I told you South Africa also grounded two other international airlines over the same issue.\n\nHowever, if people had quickly realised that their planes were also not complaint, they should have acted.\n\nIf the planes don't have that compliance, they should just be grounded. There are no two ways about it. that has to be done until they comply.\n\nBM: When do we expect this compliance?\n\nJG: The problem is that this happened during the weekend and so for the offices to be opened and the work to be done and for the applications to be made, there is going to be a delay.\n\nSo as a result both airlines, the SAA and AirZim, are now incurring expenses of housing people in hotels up to maybe Monday.\n\nBM: What is the cost to the Zimbabwean economy and specifically to the debt-ridden AirZim?\n\nJG: Not necessarily the cost to our economy. It is going to affect both sides. I don't know how I can explain so that you understand.\n\nIt's a compliance issue and if it has not been fulfilled, it has to be done. If this happens, then all passengers have to be taken care of in hotels.\n\nThose from Zimbabwe have to be housed in hotels in South Africa until they travel; those who were going to South Africa with SAA are also housed here. So its tit for tat.\n\nBut it's a balancing act if you are talking of economies now, both economies suffer.\n\nBM: But can we afford to have a tit for tat with South Africa, our major trading partner seeing that we are on the back foot on the economic front?\n\nJG: It's not a tit for tat, don't be negative my brother. It's not a question of tit for tat. It's a question of compliance by airlines.\n\nThey did not comply and not only South Africa and others, that's why I said some planes in South Africa were grounded.\n\nEven in Zimbabwe we will ground even if it's Emirates or any airline which will not be compliant. That is what happens in airlines.\n\nIt's just like driving without a licence and you are arrested in Zambia and if a Zambian is arrested in Zimbabwe for the same offence, it's not a tit for tat issue.\n\nIt's because you don't have a licence. So many airlines had not complied, they had just relaxed.\n\nBM: As neighbours who cooperate on different platforms, have you failed to reach an agreement to let the planes fly until Monday when you can sort this out?\n\nJG: This is what we were asking the two civil aviation authorities to try and do because this stance is inconveniencing passengers.\n\nBut then, if you look at it, SAA and AirZim and the number of planes and the flights, South Africa has more to lose than Zimbabwe.\n\nSAA fly more planes than us to Harare and Victoria Falls so if all planes are not compliant, then there is a problem.\n\nSo I was talking to my counterpart in South Africa discussing this issue, saying our airlines have disappointed us because they have to be compliant.\n\nBM: Zimbabwe had a diplomatic tiff with South Africa over the past week [Grace Mugabe's case], could this be in any way linked to that stand-off.\n\nJG: Taking this to that level is failure. This has nothing to do with politics or anything, but in the private media those are the things you want to latch on.\n\nBut it has nothing to do with that and [we shouldn't] turn this question of compliance into politics when it is about people who failed to do their work in a proper manner.\n\nBM: We have seen pictures of Zimbabwe Airways in Malaysia, a company which reportedly is going to succeed AirZim. When are the planes coming and how much is the deal worth?\n\nJG: Those ones are not yet here and do not belong to Air Zimbabwe. These are private planes. If you want to buy your planes, buy, then we will give you a licence and you can fly them.\n\nThese ones you are talking about have nothing to do with Air Zimbabwe. It's a different company altogether which wants to fly its planes here.\n\nThey are like anybody, like fly Africa, like Fly Angels. It's not a question for me. It's a question for those who buy their planes. As minister of Transport, I can only assist those who buy their planes and license them.\n\nBM: Don't you have a deal to buy or lease planes which will be branded as Zimbabwe Airways with the Malaysians?\n\nJG: We don't have money to buy new planes. If we had money, we would have bought already. I said we want to have a partnership, but in pursuing this partnership, I am yet to conclude the deal, because I have to deal with the AirZim debt, which I have placed before Cabinet.\n\nIf I am successful in getting that debt taken over by government, then I will be in a good position to negotiate with those I can have a partnership with.\n\nBut in the meantime, we have those who want to buy their planes or those who want to lease their planes in Zimbabwe and we encourage them to come and do so.\n\nBM: We understand that Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa was supposed to return to Zimbabwe today. How is that going to be possible with planes grounded?\n\nJG: You had been told that he is coming back today? Who had told you that?\n\nBM: Will he be able to come back if AirZim is grounded?\n\nJG: Well, I did not know that. I am in Midlands. Had you also told me that he is landing today I would have been in Harare to welcome him back home.

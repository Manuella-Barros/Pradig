Rising oilsands production and limited pipeline space in the fall of 2018 caused Canada's heavy oil benchmark price, known as Western Canada Select, to sell at nearly US$50 per barrel below the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate. The government of Alberta ended up curtailing oil production in the province for a time to address the problem.\n\nA similar problem occurred in 2012-2013, prompting then-Alberta premier Alison Redford to blame what she called the \"bitumen bubble\" for a massive shortfall in government revenues.\n\nA 2020 study by IHS Markit estimated that insufficient pipeline export capacity resulted in US$14 billion in lost value to Canada between 2015 and 2019.\n\nBut the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is expected to change things. The expansion, which marked its official opening last week, gives Canadian oil shippers access to an additional 590,000 barrels-per-day of pipeline capacity and opens up new markets for oilsands product in Asia and along the U.S. Pacific Coast.\n\nMEG is one of the main beneficiaries of the Trans Mountain expansion, with 20,000 barrels per day of contracted capacity on the pipeline.\n\nPrices for Canadian heavy oil increased, and the WCS-WTI differential narrowed, in April in anticipation of the start-up of the pipeline expansion and Alson said Tuesday he expects that to be a long-term trend.\n\n\"With this critical infrastructure now complete, we anticipate light-heavy differentials will remain narrow for years,\" he said.\n\nOilsands companies have had years to ramp up their production in advance of Trans Mountain coming online, since the pipeline expansion was first proposed a dozen years ago and took more than four years to construct. Many analysts have suggested that the pipeline will quickly be filled, something Alson acknowledged.\n\n\"As an industry, we have a history of filling available egress, and I think that will happen again over time,\" he said.\n\n\"There are various estimates as to when that could occur. We've seen (projections) as recent as two years, others within five or six. Our thinking is closer to the outer end of that time frame.\"\n\nAlson said he does not expect another oil pipeline to be built in Canada. But he said a potential future expansion of Enbridge Inc.'s Mainline pipeline network, which has been expanded many times in its 75-year history, could offer some relief to oil shippers once Trans Mountain is full.\n\nHe said there may also be ways to enhance the efficiency, or \"de-bottleneck\" other existing pipelines without starting from scratch with new construction.\n\nMEG Energy Corp. said it earned $98 million in its first quarter, up from $81 million during the same quarter last year.\n\nThe Calgary-based company's revenues totalled $1.4 billion, down from $1.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were 36 cents, up from 28 cents.\n\nBitumen production averaged about 104,000 barrels per day during the period ended March 31.\n\nFormer chief operating officer

It's good for our industry, it's good for Suncor,\" Oldreive said.\n\nAccording to numbers provided by the Canada Energy Regulator, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is expected to boost total western Canadian crude oil export capacity by 13 per cent once fully in service. (While officially open, the pipeline is still filling with crude, and the first tanker ship is not expected to load from the new line for export until the middle of the month.)\n\nOverall, the capacity of the Trans Mountain expansion will represent 17 per cent of the total pipeline export capacity available to Canadian crude oil shippers, according to the Canada Energy Regulator.\n\nOldrieve said on Wednesday's call that Suncor expects the crude oil loaded off the Trans Mountain pipeline onto tanker ships at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby, B.C., will be delivered primarily into California as well as Asian markets.\n\nHe said Suncor's trading offices in Calgary, Houston and London, England have been working to strengthen relationships with customers along the West Coast and in Asia to capitalize on the opening of the Trans Mountain project.\n\n\"We've got a pretty sophisticated trading platform. And what might make us a bit unique is we're not reliant on third-party trading shops,\" Oldrieve said.\n\n\"This allows us to capture the full value of the transaction by transacting directly with customers.\"\n\nEighty per cent of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion's capacity is tied to long-term contracts with crude oil shippers, leaving the remaining 20 per cent available for spot shipments on a month-to-month basis.\n\nContracted oil shippers, including Suncor, are currently locked in an ongoing dispute with Trans Mountain Corp. over the rising tolls the Crown corporation wants to charge them to move their product on the pipeline.\n\nThe start-up of Trans Mountain is coinciding with increased output from Western Canadian oil companies. In Alberta specifically, oil output hit record-high production of 4.53 million barrels per day in December 2023, Canada Energy Regulator figures show.\n\nSuncor itself said in a news release after the close of markets Tuesday that it earned $1.61 billion in the first three months of 2024, down from $2.05 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe company reported record upstream production of 835,000 barrels per day during the quarter, including all-time high oilsands production of 785,000 barrels per day.\n\nThe company also said it achieved record refined product sales of 581,000 barrels per day, and saw its highest-ever first quarter refining throughput at 455,000 barrels per day with 98 per cent overall refinery utilization.\n\nSuncor has scheduled a presentation for investors on May 21, when it has said it will provide an update on progress made by the company to lower its costs and increase shareholder returns.\n\nCEO Rich Kruger, who was brought in to lead the energy giant amid growing investor pressure for the company to improve its safety record and operational performance, has now been at the helm for just over a year.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May

That cost the federal government $3.3 billion (C$4.5 billion) at the time. Since then, the costs for the pipeline expansion have soared to nearly $23 billion (C$30.9 billion).\n\nRegulatory hurdles have added years to the timeline for the pipeline completion, but TMX received the final permits in early May from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). This allowed it to enter into service on May 1.\n\nCanada's Takeaway Capacity Grows\n\nThe expanded pipeline provides increased transportation capacity for Canadian producers to get their oil out of Alberta and into the Pacific Coast and then to the U.S. West Coast or Asian markets.\n\nThe rise in pipeline egress is set to boost the price of Western Canada Select (WCS), the benchmark for Canadian heavy crude sold at Hardisty in Alberta, as it will narrow the discount at which WCS has traded in recent years relative to the U.S. crude oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI).\n\nOver the past decade, there have been periods of time when WCS traded at discounts of about $40 per barrel below WTI due to a lack of enough pipeline capacity to take rising Canadian crude oil production out of Alberta. Such was the case in 2018 and 2019, when high production but insufficient takeaway capacity were depressing Canadian heavy crude prices, limiting profits for producers even as they boosted their output amid higher global oil prices and strong oil demand.\n\nWith TMX now in service, producers see more options to get their crude to demand centers.\n\nHigher Canadian Oil Prices 'For Years'\n\nWhile the biggest Canadian oil producers reported a mixed bag of Q1 earnings this spring, all of them expect TMX to boost Canada's oil prices and to be a major asset for the industry for years to come.\n\nMEG Energy, for example, sees the expanded pipeline raising Alberta's crude prices \"for years\" to come, executives said on the company's earnings call this week.\n\n\"It is great for industry and Canada to have that tremendous asset available,\" Erik Alson, MEG's Vice President of Marketing, said.\n\nThe narrowing of the WCS-WTI differential will be a long-term trend, the executive added.\n\n\"With this critical infrastructure now complete, we anticipate light-heavy differentials will remain narrow for years,\" Alson told analysts, as carried by The Canadian Press.\n\nCanadian Natural Resources, the top oil and gas producer in Canada, also expects TMX to provide \"ample egress and optionality for our crude oil products.\"\n\nCanadian Natural has optionality for crude oil exports, including 94,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline that creates additional crude oil market diversification opportunities on the West Coast, both by land and by water.\n\n\"After the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline is finished, crude oil products will have plenty of egress and optionality,\" executives said.\n\nCanadian Natural's president, Scott Stauth, told analysts that the company had secured some marine sales from TMX. Some of the sales \"may end up going marine side still onto the West Coast, or it could move to Asian markets,\" Stauth added.\n\nDrew Zieglgansberger, Executive Vice-President and Chief Commercial Officer at another major producer, Cenovus Energy, said, \"We're pretty excited on behalf of the industry and Canada to have another great asset available to us.\"\n\n\"There's a pretty vast market out there, which is exciting,\" Zieglgansberger told analysts on the company's Q1 earnings call.\n\nThe industry as a whole and the province of Alberta also view the TMX start-up as a boon to the Canadian oil sector.\n\n\"With improved access to global markets, Canadians can look forward to receiving higher value for our energy resources, meaning more money coming back into the economy,\" Lisa Baiton, President and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said.\n\n\"As the world undergoes rapid and sometimes violent geopolitical realignments, safe and reliable oil and gas supplies will be a priority for governments for years to come,\" Baiton noted.\n\n\"The completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion will help Canada play an enduring strategic role in ensuring our allies and trading partners have access to a reliable and trusted source of critical energy.\"\n\nAlberta's government expects narrower discounts for Canadian crude and a surge in oil production in the province, thanks to the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline.\n\nIn its 2023-24 Mid-year Fiscal Update and Economic Statement at the end of last year, the government of Alberta said that \"The completion of TMX in the second half of 2024 will help bring the differential to around US$14-15/bbl in the next two fiscal years.\"\n\n\"Increased takeaway capacity will help propel Alberta's crude oil production from nearly 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to over four million barrels bpd by 2026,\" the provincial government reckons.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType":

The recently completed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline will raise Canadian oil prices for \"years\" to come, an executive with oilsands producer MEG Energy Corp. said Tuesday. Canadian heavy oil has historically sold at a lower price than lighter U.S. crude, partly because of differences in product quality and transportation costs, but also because of a lack of export capacity by pipeline that limited market access for Canadian oil. MEG is a major beneficiary of the Trans Mountain expansion, with contracted capacity of 20,000 barrels per day on the pipeline. MEG Energy Corp. said it earned $98 million in the first quarter, compared to $81 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nCrescent Point Energy Corp. Energy. Up seven cents, or 0.58 percent, to $12.15. Crescent Point Energy Corp. announced it had signed a $600 million deal to sell some of its Saskatchewan oil properties to Saturn Oil & Gas.

As a result of this agreement, Crescent Point is revising its average annual production forecast for 2024 to a range of 191,000 to 199,000 boe/d, a reduction of 7,000 boe/d from the midpoint of its forecast range former.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 7, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEG_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MEG Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\u2013Dominion_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto\u2013Dominion Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manulife", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manulife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncor_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suncor Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enbridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enbridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Point_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crescent Point Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_crude_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy crude oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil sands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_of_oil_equivalent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel of oil equivalent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/site_images/national_business_2017.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547543", "eventUri": "eng-9547543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Together, the two pipelines are expected to deliver about 890,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nCanada's heavy crude oil trades at a discounted price compared to the light crude oil from the United States due to factors such as transportation costs, limited market access and quality differences. Analysts and industry insiders expect the Trans Mountain pipeline to reduce the difference in prices since it will make transportation cheaper and open new markets.\n\nOldreive said he expects crude oil in the pipeline to reach markets in California and Asia. He added that Suncor's trading offices were working to \"strengthen relationships\" with those markets so the company can directly negotiate with customers and get better deals.\n\n\"I think it gives us a bit of a competitive advantage,\" he said. \"In fact, in the first quarter, we delivered diesel off the east coast to Scandinavia, capturing unique quality differentials in that market. Similarly, we have been able to capture quality differentials off the west coast down into Latin America.\"\n\nOther oil producers have also said they expect the pipeline to improve conditions for Canadian companies.\n\nCenovus Energy Inc. on May 1 said it has its eyes set on a \"pretty vast market,\" and added that Canada needs to build more infrastructure to tackle its decreasing productivity.\n\nCanadian Natural Resources Ltd. on May 2 said the new pipeline creates additional exporting opportunities on the west coast, and Meg Energy Corp. expects Canada's oil producers to get better prices \"for years.\"\n\nSuncor reported first-quarter earnings of $1.25 per common share, compared to $1.54 in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, its first-quarter operating earnings of $1.82 billion were higher than the $1.81 billion in the prior year's quarter.\n\nThe company also reported an all-time high in oilsands production of 785,000 barrels per day and its highest-ever first quarter in refining throughput of 455,000 barrels per day.\n\nSuncor on Tuesday held its annual general meeting, where shareholders were asked to vote on two resolutions, both of which failed to pass.\n\nThe first resolution requested that Suncor end its pledge to become a net-zero emitter by 2050, which was rejected by 98.92 per cent of the shares represented at the vote. This proposal was submitted by InvestNow Inc., which said the goal would be costly and could have a negative impact on the company.\n\nThe second resolution requested that Suncor provide more details on its climate transition. This was rejected by 88.45 per cent of the shares. This was submitted by Salal Foundation, a non-profit that wanted Suncor to be more accountable for its emissions.\n\nThe results of both votes were in line with Suncor's recommendations.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

RBC Capital Markets says the oil sands producer's cash flow is among the most sensitive to higher prices.\n\nErik Alson, Calgary-based MEG's vice-president of marketing, is the latest Canadian oil patch executive to praise the basin's first major expansion of pipeline capacity in over a decade. The industry hopes the bigger artery from Alberta to the B.C. coast will end years of depressed Western Canadian Select (WCS) prices by improving access to global markets.\n\nCanadian crude trades at a discount to the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) due to its heavier grade and transportation costs.\n\n\"With this critical infrastructure now complete, we anticipate that light-heavy differentials remain narrow for a year while egress remains unconstrained,\" Alson told analysts on MEG's post-earnings conference call on Tuesday.\n\nHe estimates it could take about six years for the industry to max out the new 890,000 barrel per day capacity of TMX.\n\n\"Before TMX fills, I think you will see additional egress from an Enbridge Mainline expansion,\" Alson added. \"While I don't see another pipeline being built, I believe there's de-bottlenecking of other existing pipelines that will occur.\"\n\nLast month, RBC analyst Greg Pardy hailed the nearly 600,000 barrel per day TMX as a \"game changer set to substantially boost Canada's oil export capacity and afford oil sands producers global market optionality.\"\n\n\"Prevailing WCS-WTI spreads of around US$12 have narrowed in concert with TMX's call for line-fill of 2.1 million barrels in each of April and May, but could dip into the single digits in the second half of 2024,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nPardy picks MEG and Athabasca Oil (ATH.TO) as companies in the sector that are the most cash flow sensitive to changes in WCS-WTI spreads.

The recently completed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will boost Canadian oil prices for \"years\" to come, an executive with oilsands producer MEG Energy Corp. said Tuesday. Canadian heavy oil has historically sold at a discount to lighter U.S. crude, in part due to differences in product quality and transportation costs, but also due to a lack of pipeline export capacity that has limited market access for Canadian oil. MEG is one of the main beneficiaries of the Trans Mountain expansion, with 20,000 barrels per day of contracted capacity on the pipeline.

Up seven cents, or 0.58 per cent, to $12.15. Crescent Point Energy Corp. said it has signed a $600-million deal to sell some of its oil-producing properties in Saskatchewan to Saturn Oil & Gas. The company said included in the deal are its Flat Lake and Battrum properties. It says production from the assets is expected to be 13,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the next 12 months. As a result of the deal, Crescent Point is revising its 2024 annual average production guidance to a range of 191,000 to 199,000 boe/d, a reduction of 7,000 boe/d compared with the midpoint of its prior guidance range.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 7,2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "sudbury.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sudbury.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@sudbury.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\u2013Dominion_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto\u2013Dominion Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manulife", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manulife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEG_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MEG Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enbridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enbridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Point_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crescent Point Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_crude_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy crude oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil sands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncor_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suncor Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_of_oil_equivalent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel of oil equivalent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/site_images/national_business_2017.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547543", "eventUri": "eng-9547543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2279, "textEnd": 2284}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Committed shippers have reserved space on 80% of the pipeline, leaving 20% available to spot shipments.\n\nThe expansion provides Canada, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, with ample pipeline space for the first time in over a decade and has helped lift benchmark heavy oil prices.\n\nCanada produced 4.9 million bpd of oil in 2023, of which a record 4.5 million bpd came from Alberta. Thanks to TMX the industry now has nearly 5.3 million bpd of pipeline capacity, according to Canada Energy Regulator.\n\nBut producers are forging ahead with oil output expansion plans that will rapidly fill the unused space.\n\n\"TMX is the single largest capacity addition in one shot in over a decade but it looks unlikely to solve the egress issue on its own,\" said Kevin Birn, chief analyst of Canadian oil markets at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\"There's so much potential (in Canada) but all the basic fundamental realities of the market have not changed.\"\n\nCanadian producers could add 300,000-500,000 bpd of oil in 2024 alone, making Canada one of the world's largest sources of supply growth, according to TD Securities estimates.\n\nMany analysts expect this will be the last oil pipeline ever built in Canada. Regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition, they say, will hinder some of the more ambitious growth proposals outlined by companies including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and the Alberta government.\n\nCanada's oil reserves are enormous: the third-largest in the world, mostly comprised of vast bitumen deposits strewn beneath the boreal forest and peat bogs of northern Alberta.\n\nThis year Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she wants to double the province's oil and gas production.\n\nBut unlike top U.S. shale-producing regions where pipeline firms overbuilt capacity, growth in Alberta has long been limited by how much oil can move out of the landlocked province.\n\nOn earnings calls over the past two weeks, some producers including Suncor Energy and Imperial Oil reported new oil sands production records. Firms also outlined plans to boost output further through measures such as adding new well pads at existing thermal projects and optimizing operations at mine sites.\n\nTMX's start-up will enable Alberta and Suncor production growth and reduce the discount on Canadian crude, said Dave Oldreive, Suncor's executive vice president of downstream, on a Wednesday earnings call.\n\nCanadian Natural, the country's largest oil and gas firm with 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) of output, last week said it is considering a 195,000 bpd expansion of bitumen production at its Horizon oil sands mine. Horizon currently has capacity to produce about 255,000 bpd of synthetic crude oil, upgraded from bitumen.\n\nBut Canadian Natural President Scott Stauth said that would hinge on new pipeline export capacity and government financial support for reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\"That fiscal policy is absolutely key for us to be able to move any additional expansion volumes forward,\" Stauth said on an earnings call last week. \"Also important in terms of that would be securing and working on enhancing egress capacity.\"\n\nRival Cenovus Energy is planning to grow production by 150,000 bpd, or 19%, over the next three to four years.\n\nCEO Jon McKenzie welcomed TMX and its positive impact on crude prices, but said Canada's spare pipeline capacity would likely disappear within five years.\n\n\"As an industry, we have a history of filling up excess egress, and I think that will happen through time,\" McKenzie said on an earnings call.\n\n(Reporting by Nia Williams in British

to boost Canada's crude oil export", "body": "OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The newly completed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will boost exports of Canadian crude oil, Statistics Canada said Thursday.\n\nIn its annual trade review, the national statistical agency said Canadian crude oil in particular may benefit from the completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in 2024, adding that the increased capacity to transport crude oil should bolster exports of this product to markets in Asia and the West Coast of the United States.\n\nCanada's Crown corporation Trans Mountain announced on May 1 the commercial start of the long-awaited crude oil pipeline expansion from oil-producing Alberta to the British Columbia coast which will increase the Trans Mountain system's shipping capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day.\n\nExpanding to new markets could also translate into a smaller differential between the benchmark price of North American light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate) and Canadian heavy crude oil (Western Canadian Select), which would encourage an increase in the value of Canadian crude oil exports, the agency said.\n\nChanges in economic activity in 2024, as well as factors such as production and inventory levels in North America, production targets of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners (OPEC+), and evolving global conflicts, will continue to influence crude oil prices, the agency said.\n\nIn 2023, the value of Canada's annual merchandise exports decreased 1.4 percent to 768.2 billion Canadian dollars (561.7 billion U.S. dollars), while the value of annual imports rose 1.4 percent to 770.2 billion Canadian dollars (563.1 billion U.S. dollars), essentially in a balanced

Committed shippers have reserved space on 80 per cent of the pipeline, leaving 20 per cent available to spot shipments.\n\nThe expansion provides Canada, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, with ample pipeline space for the first time in over a decade and has helped lift benchmark heavy oil prices.\n\nCanada produced 4.9 million bpd of oil in 2023, of which a record 4.5 million bpd came from Alberta. Thanks to TMX the industry now has nearly 5.3 million bpd of pipeline capacity, according to Canada Energy Regulator.\n\nBut producers are forging ahead with oil output expansion plans that will rapidly fill the unused space.\n\n\"TMX is the single largest capacity addition in one shot in over a decade but it looks unlikely to solve the egress issue on its own,\" said Kevin Birn, chief analyst of Canadian oil markets at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\"There's so much potential (in Canada) but all the basic fundamental realities of the market have not changed.\"\n\nCanadian producers could add 300,000-500,000 bpd of oil in 2024 alone, making Canada one of the world's largest sources of supply growth, according to TD Securities estimates.\n\nMany analysts expect this will be the last oil pipeline ever built in Canada. Regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition, they say, will hinder some of the more ambitious growth proposals outlined by companies including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ-T and the Alberta government.\n\nCanada's oil reserves are enormous: the third-largest in the world, mostly comprised of vast bitumen deposits strewn beneath the boreal forest and peat bogs of northern Alberta.\n\nThis year Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she wants to double the province's oil and gas production.\n\nBut unlike top U.S. shale-producing regions where pipeline firms overbuilt capacity, growth in Alberta has long been limited by how much oil can move out of the landlocked province.\n\nOn earnings calls over the past two weeks, some producers including Suncor Energy SU-T and Imperial Oil IMO-T reported new oil sands production records. Firms also outlined plans to boost output further through measures such as adding new well pads at existing thermal projects and optimizing operations at mine sites.\n\nTMX's startup will enable Alberta and Suncor production growth and reduce the discount on Canadian crude, said Dave Oldreive, Suncor's executive vice president of downstream, on a Wednesday earnings call.\n\nCanadian Natural, the country's largest oil and gas firm with 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) of output, last week said it is considering a 195,000 bpd expansion of bitumen production at its Horizon oil sands mine. Horizon currently has capacity to produce about 255,000 bpd of synthetic crude oil, upgraded from bitumen.\n\nBut Canadian Natural President Scott Stauth said that would hinge on new pipeline export capacity and government financial support for reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\"That fiscal policy is absolutely key for us to be able to move any additional expansion volumes forward,\" Stauth said on an earnings call last week. \"Also important in terms of that would be securing and working on enhancing egress capacity.\"\n\nRival Cenovus Energy CVE-T is planning to grow production by 150,000 bpd, or 19 per cent, over the next three to four years.\n\nCEO Jon McKenzie welcomed TMX and its positive impact on crude prices, but said Canada's spare pipeline capacity would likely disappear within five years.\n\n\"As an industry, we have a history of filling up excess egress, and I think that will happen through time,\" McKenzie said on an earnings call.", "source": {"uri":

CaivanoCALGARY - Suncor Energy Inc. says it is leasing and operating a number of Aframax oil tanker ships to carry crude from the recently completed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to Pacific markets. The company says leasing and operating the tankers itself means Suncor saves on shipping costs. Dave Oldreive, Suncor's executive vice-president responsible for refining, sales and marketing, says the company expects the crude oil loaded off the Trans Mountain pipeline onto tanker ships at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby, B.C., will be delivered primarily into California as well as Asian markets. He says Suncor's trading offices in Calgary, Houston and London, England have been working to strengthen relationships with customers along the West Coast and in Asia in order to capitalize on the opening of the Trans Mountain project. Oldreive made the comments Wednesday on a conference call with analysts to discuss Suncor's first-quarter financial results.

Committed shippers have reserved space on 80% of the pipeline, leaving 20% available to spot shipments.\n\nThe expansion provides Canada, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, with ample pipeline space for the first time in over a decade and has helped lift benchmark heavy oil prices.\n\nCanada produced 4.9 million bpd of oil in 2023, of which a record 4.5 million bpd came from Alberta. Thanks to TMX the industry now has nearly 5.3 million bpd of pipeline capacity, according to Canada Energy Regulator.\n\nBut producers are forging ahead with oil output expansion plans that will rapidly fill the unused space.\n\n\"TMX is the single largest capacity addition in one shot in over a decade but it looks unlikely to solve the egress issue on its own,\" said Kevin Birn, chief analyst of Canadian oil markets at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\"There's so much potential (in Canada) but all the basic fundamental realities of the market have not changed.\"\n\nCanadian producers could add 300,000-500,000 bpd of oil in 2024 alone, making Canada one of the world's largest sources of supply growth, according to TD Securities estimates.\n\nMany analysts expect this will be the last oil pipeline ever built in Canada. Regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition, they say, will hinder some of the more ambitious growth proposals outlined by companies including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and the Alberta government.\n\nWORLD'S THIRD-LARGEST RESERVES\n\nCanada's oil reserves are enormous: the third-largest in the world, mostly comprised of vast bitumen deposits strewn beneath the boreal forest and peat bogs of northern Alberta.\n\nThis year Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she wants to double the province's oil and gas production.\n\nBut unlike top U.S. shale-producing regions where pipeline firms overbuilt capacity, growth in Alberta has long been limited by how much oil can move out of the landlocked province.\n\nOn earnings calls over the past two weeks, some producers including Suncor Energy and Imperial Oil reported new oil sands production records. Firms also outlined plans to boost output further through measures such as adding new well pads at existing thermal projects and optimizing operations at mine sites.\n\nTMX's start-up will enable Alberta and Suncor production growth and reduce the discount on Canadian crude, said Dave Oldreive, Suncor's executive vice president of downstream, on a Wednesday earnings call.\n\nCanadian Natural, the country's largest oil and gas firm with 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) of output, last week said it is considering a 195,000 bpd expansion of bitumen production at its Horizon oil sands mine. Horizon currently has capacity to produce about 255,000 bpd of synthetic crude oil, upgraded from bitumen.\n\nBut Canadian Natural President Scott Stauth said that would hinge on new pipeline export capacity and government financial support for reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\"That fiscal policy is absolutely key for us to be able to move any additional expansion volumes forward,\" Stauth said on an earnings call last week. \"Also important in terms of that would be securing and working on enhancing egress capacity.\"\n\nRival Cenovus Energy is planning to grow production by 150,000 bpd, or 19%, over the next three to four years.\n\nCEO Jon McKenzie welcomed TMX and its positive impact on crude prices, but said Canada's spare pipeline capacity would likely disappear within five years.\n\n\"As an industry, we have a history of filling up excess egress, and I think that will happen through time,\" McKenzie said on an earnings call.\n\n(Reporting by Nia Williams in British

The project requires regulatory approval and a final investment decision before proceeding.\n\nThe 124-mile pipeline will run from Peers, Alberta, to Edmonton, and Dow chemicals will be its primary

This project started in 2010, and it's great pride that brings us to this moment,\" said Mike Davies, chief operating officer with Trans Mountain.\n\nIn 2013 the company submitted its original application for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project to the National Energy Board, which then approved it, subject to 157 conditions, three years later. Those conditions were met and, when shovels first went into soil the following year, it was estimated to cost just $6.8 billion.\n\nDelays and budget overruns caused the total cost to balloon approximately 500 per cent up to $34 billion. When project originator Kinder Morgan was stymied with ongoing Indigenous and environmental opposition, it threatened to shut down the process.\n\nInstead, the federal government purchased the pipeline for $4.5 billion in 2018 to make sure that the job got done. Logistics and marine timing mean that the first transport ship isn't expected to receive its first load of oil to export until mid-May. Oil is already flowing: it takes a week to get to the end point.\n\nThe pipeline's shipping capacity has swelled from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day.\n\n\"One of the things I think is really important for people to understand is the importance of the project of the economic benefits that it brings,\" Davies said.\n\n\"This pipeline has been built without compromise. Yes, it's cost a bit more and it's taken longer, but it has now met every expectation of Canadians as reflected in the regulatory requirements that are necessary to build a project like this.\"\n\nHe called it a piece of \"nation-building infrastructure\" that transforms Trans Mountain from being a pipeline that serves a regional market as the largest single source of potentially motor fuel for the Pacific Northwest to a major supplier of Canadian oil to the Pacific Rim and providing access to the western Canadian sedimentary basin to Americans.\n\nIt will create a shift in the markets that will likely be felt within the first 18 months, he claimed.\n\nThe pipeline runs from its starting point in Edmonton's Refinery Row to the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby, B.C. The expansion project involved nearly 1,000 kilometres of new buried pipeline that will transport crude oil and refined petroleum products to other refineries and terminals in B.C. and Washington. Crude oil will also be shipped to offshore markets in Asia and the U.S. west coast.\n\nThis pipe is the reactivation of the twin of the first one that was installed in 1953. The Anchor Loop twin, 193 kilometres in length between Hinton and Hargreaves, B.C., was completed in 2008.\n\nNow that the expansion project is done, the reactivation is complete.\n\nDavies spoke about how complicated it is to build linear infrastructure while being mindful of the environment and the people that inhabit the land. He said that $6 billion was awarded to Indigenous companies. The project, he continued, was the largest archaeology program in Canadian history as workers identified 360,000 archaeological sites with 250,000 artifacts that have been recovered. They monitored 27,000 birds' nests and relocated 1.5 million amphibians.\n\n\"The level of environmental protection and care that's gone into this - the quality, the construction, the feats of engineering that have been achieved to create this legacy piece of infrastructure - we're very proud of it. It's the shortest and most efficient route to tidewater, but it's also the only sovereign route within Canada for Canada's wealth of resources to get to market.\"\n\nThe first Trans Mountain pipeline experienced a number of oil spills including six through Jasper National Park alone. One of those was reportedly the second largest spill in the pipeline's entire history.\n\nThe company has aimed to make this new pipeline as sturdy and durable as it could be to avoid any future spills. Everything starts with the design of the system and with the routing to be wary of geohazards, Davies said. The pipe itself is made to hold fast against the ground and the other elements it is surrounded by. The pipeline only exists to transport oil so everything from the metallurgy to the manufacturing to the inspection only has that goal in mind.\n\n\"The pipe is specified based on the requirements that it would foresee,\" Davies said.\n\n\"But in many places, we have added extra wall thickness, essentially extra strength, over and above what would otherwise be required.\"\n\nHydrostatic testing was also done to doublecheck the welds would hold to a pressure greater than the pipeline would see during normal service. In Jasper National Park, that hydrostatic testing was conducted between August and October 2022. It was monitored by Parks Canada environmental surveillance officers.\n\nWithin these next two years, the company will also run further testing to identify any potential defects that might have made it through. Cathodic protection sends a low electrical current along the surface to prevent corrosion of the external metal layer.\n\nAbove ground, the right of way is cleared of growth and Trans Mountain has a line patrol that flies regularly to maintain air coverage.\n\nScott Hayes, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, Jasper Fitzhugh", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Together, the two pipelines are expected to deliver about 890,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nCanada's heavy crude oil trades at a discounted price compared to the light crude oil from the United States due to factors such as transportation costs, limited market access and quality differences. Analysts and industry insiders expect the Trans Mountain pipeline to reduce the difference in prices since it will make transportation cheaper and open new markets.\n\nOldreive said he expects crude oil in the pipeline to reach markets in California and Asia. He added that Suncor's trading offices were working to \"strengthen relationships\" with those markets so the company can directly negotiate with customers and get better deals.", "source": {"uri": "financialpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncor_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suncor Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Mountain_pipeline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trans Mountain pipeline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_crude_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Light crude oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_crude_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy crude oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240109110124-659d738cdcf934f5797820f4jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547543", "eventUri": "eng-9547543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nThere were plenty of positives for both Slovenia and Serbia to take from their opening games at Euro 2024. There were also similarities between their games.\n\nBoth sides fell behind in the first half. Christian Eriksen put Denmark in front against Slovenia, while Jude Bellingham gave England the lead against Serbia.\n\nThese two teams spent most of the opening period on the back foot - no surprise given their opponents had superior talent in their ranks.\n\nBut neither Slovenia nor Serbia accepted their fate. Both sides fought their way back into the match and put their adversaries under pressure.\n\nThe outcome was not the same in both games, however. Whereas Slovenia struck an equaliser through Erik Janza, Serbia could not find a way to breach England's backline.\n\nThis is a key match for both teams. A win for Slovenia would almost certainly send them through to the knockout phase with a game to spare.\n\nA victory for Serbia, meanwhile, would put them in a strong position as they seek to advance to the round of 16.\n\nDragan Stojkovic was a hugely successful player during his own career, but the Serbia manager had come under pressure ahead of Euro 2024. Yet he will feel vindicated by his team's display against England, with Serbia competitive throughout.\n\nThis match will have a different dynamic. Whereas Serbia were the underdogs last time out, they will be the favourites on Thursday. We will have to see how well they handle the extra responsibility and pressure that brings.\n\nIt will also be a test of Serbia's guile. They will have more of the ball here and will need to show both guile and patience to break down the Slovenia backline.\n\nAs for Matjaz Kek, he will be looking for more of the same from his Slovenia side.\n\nHaving said that, a failure to win here would leave them in a difficult position ahead of their clash with England on matchday three. A tally of two points or fewer is unlikely to be enough to make it through.\n\nA victory for either Slovenia or Serbia would be huge for their chances of reaching the knockout phase.\n\nThe 4-4-2 formation was once dominant in European football, but it is a rarity these days. Slovenia are proponents of the system, though, and Kek has coached it well.\n\nAgainst Denmark, we saw a Slovenia side made up of 11 players (and five used substitutes) who each knew what was expected of him.\n\nEriksen did find space between the lines on occasion, but as the game wore on Slovenia increasingly squeezed those gaps. They will look to be similarly compact here.\n\nSlovenia also showed plenty of fight and competitiveness. They are unlikely to reach the latter stages of this competition, but you would not be surprised if all their games were tight.\n\nSerbia still need to show that they can find the right balance between attack and defence in a match they are expected to win. There could ultimately be little between the sides in Munich.\n\n\u26bd Back a draw at 5/2 with Sky Bet \u26bd\n\nAt the World Cup in Qatar 18 months ago, Serbia scored more goals than any other team in their group, including Brazil. Yet they crashed out in last place with just one point to their name.\n\nSerbia showed more grit and resolve against England and Stojkovic will be pleased that his side conceded few clear-cut chances after the Bellingham goal.\n\nThey are not short of quality going forward, although it may be better to drop Dusan Vlahovic (a striker) for Dusan Tadic (an attacking midfielder) here.\n\nSlovenia will not be easy to break down, though. They will get men behind the ball and look to make life difficult for Serbia in the final third.\n\nSlovenia will look to break forward quickly when the ball changes hands, but it is hard to see this being a high-scoring affair.\n\n\u26bd Choose under 2.5 goals at 4/5 with Betfred \u26bd\n\nJuventus striker Vlahovic is playing at a higher level in the club game than Aleksandar Mitrovic, who left Fulham for Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia last year.\n\nBut Mitrovic is still the main man up front for Serbia, for whom he has scored more goals than anyone else.\n\nSlovenia will sit deep in this game, so Mitrovic's aerial mastery and penalty-box presence will be invaluable.\n\nSerbia's attacking strategy is based on getting the ball to their wing-backs and sending crosses into the penalty area.\n\nMitrovic is a player who comes alive in the 18-yard box, even if he does not offer a great deal outside it. He is the obvious choice to find the back of the net in the early game on Thursday.\n\n\u26bd Tip Aleksandar Mitrovic to score any time at 13/10 with talkSPORT BET \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

Luka Jovic's header on a corner was the latest equalizer in the history of the European Championship. In doing so, he pulled out what could be a pivotal point for Serbia after falling to England in its first game. It is heartbreak for Slovenia, which has never won a game in the history of the Euros. The 1-1 result keeps it all to play for with each of these teams, regardless of what happens in Thursday's England-Denmark contest.\n\nThe first half went without a goal, though. Serbia came the closest as Timi Max El\u0161nik thundered a ball off the Slovenia post. As has been the case with many of the Balkan nations at Euro 2024, the game had a frenetic pace. Despite drawing its first game against Denmark, Slovenia looked much stronger on Thursday. Even though Serbia had several chances, Slovenia matched with opportunities of its own.\n\nThen, in the second half, it was a brilliant break to put Slovenia ahead. One long switch led to another for Slovenia. After Benjamin Sesko forced a save out of the Serbia goalkeeper, his side pushed forward in the 69th minute. \u017dan Karni\u010dnik started the move by foraying forward from his right-back spot. Elsnik, who hit the post in the first half, received the pass from Karni\u010dnik on the left side. He delivered an inch-perfect cross to the back post where Karni\u010dnik was alone. He tapped the ball in to send Slovenia supporters into an uproar.\n\nThree minutes after that opening goal, Serbia rattled the crossbar. Aleksandar Mitrovic wrestled free from a Slovenia defender to get to the end of a cross. His first-time effort slammed off the crossbar and away from danger.\n\nIf the Mitrovic's shot off the woodwork was any indication, Serbia was using cross after cross. By the end of the game, Serbia mustered 33 crosses into the Slovenia box, the most among any team at Euro 2024 in one game. Eventually, one of those was going to find a clinical finish. Yet, the time in which it happened was unbelievable. In the dying seconds of the fifth minute of stoppage time, Serbia sent the goalkeeper up in search of a tying goal from a corner. The in-swinging ball met the head of Luka Jovic, who guided the ball beyond Jan Oblak.\n\nThe goal has major ramifications in Group C. Serbia, which lost to England in the first matchday, picked up its first point of the tournament. With a fixture against Denmark in the final game, a win would likely be enough to get Serbia into the knockout stages. Even if it finishes third behind England and Slovenia, four points would put it among the top third-place teams in the tournament.\n\nFor Slovenia, it was seconds away from that four-point threshold.

Both sides hit the woodwork and had periods where they dominated possession and created chances at the Munich Football Arena in a game that swung from end-to-end at times.\n\nThe result puts Slovenia in second place on two points with leaders England, who have three, to come in their final group game. Serbia, bottom with one point, next face Denmark, who also have one point and play England later on Thursday. Slovenia remain unbeaten and still firmly in contention to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. For Serbia, the point also bolsters their hopes of progressing.\n\nSerbia manager Dragan Stojkovic praised Slovenia's discipline and bemoaned the fact that despite creating 15 goal attempts his side did not score until almost the final whistle. \"We created chances,\" Stojkovic said. \"It was incredible how the ball did not want to enter the goal.\"(With Denmark) it will be us or them. We will play an open game.\"\n\nJust like in their 1-0 opening defeat against England, Serbia started slowly and handed the initiative to Slovenia whose first big chance came when Timi Elsnik hit the near post after dribbling into the box in the first half. Slovenia broke the deadlock after the break with a brilliantly worked goal from man-of-the-match Karnicnik who put them on the brink of their first ever Euros win.\n\nSlovenia had missed several good chances until right back Karnicnik drove upfield from the edge of his own penalty area, released the ball to Elsnik and then met the return cross to slot the ball past Predrag Rajkovic in the 69th minute.\n\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE\n\nSlovenia coach Matjaz Kek thanked his players for their efforts in what he called a great atmosphere but said they ran out of steam towards the end of the contest. \"Slovenia has shown that it has a place here at the European Championship,\" Kek said. \"Sport and football in general can be cruel but I believe karma will do its part for this team.\n\n\"We have felt disappointment because we know how strong the Serbia players are. There was a bit of a lack of concentration, perhaps a bit of a lack of strength in the last minutes.\" Serbia ratcheted up the pressure looking for an equaliser with veteran striker Aleksandar Mitrovic hitting the post, and they finally levelled when Jovic nodded home a corner five minutes into added time to leave their opponents distraught.\n\nSerbia had failed to capitalise on periods of superiority despite the menace of Mitrovic, who saw a close range shot deflected by Karnicnik onto the woodwork, until Jovic struck. \"They were the better team in the first half but we prevailed in the second,\" Mitrovic said. \"We created a lot of chances and I was especially unlucky.

A late strike denied Slovenia a first-ever win in a European Championship as Serbia snatched a 1-1 draw on Thursday.\n\nMunich, Jun 20 (AP) A late strike denied Slovenia a first-ever win in a European Championship as Serbia snatched a 1-1 draw on Thursday.\n\n\u017dan Karnicnik's 69th-minute goal put Slovenia on the brink of a historic win until substitute Luka Jovic levelled deep in stoppage time.\n\nAlso Read | On Which TV Channel Copa America 2024 Will Be Telecast Live?

Serbia lost to England in their opener.\n\nWith both teams needing a win to boost their chances of progressing, the match started at a fast pace and Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic had to make two early saves.\n\nThose two shots on target in the first eight minutes were as many as Slovenia had in total in its draw with Denmark.\n\nSerbia withstood the waves of Slovenia attacks and had its first chance in the 27th minute, but Du\u0161an Vlahovic's header was straight at goalkeeper Jan Oblak.\n\nSerbia went even closer moments later when Du\u0161an Tadic whipped in a fabulous corner to the far post, but Aleksandar Mitrovic -- who scored in his previous two matches against Slovenia -- couldn't get a proper touch.\n\nThe best chance of the half fell to Slovenia in somewhat fortunate circumstances. Timi El\u0161nik tried to pass to a teammate but the ball came off a Serbia defender and fell kindly back to him for a thunderous effort which crashed off the right post. Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko fired the rebound woefully over.\n\nSerbia started the second half with three great chances to break the deadlock inside the first five minutes, including Slovenia defender Jake Bijol almost scoring an own goal.\n\nThis tournament has seen plenty of stunning long-range goals and there was almost another in the 58th but Rajkovic did well to push \u0160e\u0161ko's strike over the bar.\n\nSlovenia eventually broke the deadlock with a move started and finished by \u017dan Karnicnik. The defender won the ball deep inside his own half and ran some 40 yards before picking out El\u0161nik on the left and racing into the box to collect the cross and tap home at the back post.\n\nSerbia almost levelled immediately, but El\u0161nik hit the crossbar. Serbia threw everything at Slovenia in the final stages.\n\nEven Rajkovic came up for the final corner, but it was Jovic who leapt highest to head it past Oblak in the fifth minute of added time.

This is its first European Championship as an independent nation.\n\n-- The two teams met at Euro 2000 -- the last time either qualified -- with 10-man Yugoslavia fighting back from three goals down to draw 3-3. Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u0107 was a substitute during that match.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Neither coach has reported any injury concerns.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- There has been little to choose between the teams over the years with six of the eight matches they've played ending in a draw. They have one win apiece.\n\n-- Slovenia is on a seven-match unbeaten run that included a surprise 2-0 win over Portugal in a friendly international in March.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n-- \"We're going to do whatever we can against Slovenia, we have to win that. I congratulate all the players (after the England match), there are no frustrations apart from the result. I don't like losing but it's part of the job.\" Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u0107.\n\n-- \"Many of my players have never played in such a big competition. When we saw something was possible (against Denmark), they started playing.\" Slovenia coach Matja\u017e Kek.\n\n-- \" How we start is important and we want to set the tone from the beginning. We are the tallest team at the Euro and we need to be even more dangerous from set-pieces.\" Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovi\u0107.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia and Montenegro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Milenkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Milenkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matja\u017e_Kek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matja\u017e Kek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/05/b05e058b-a4cc-5c18-b2f9-6b28c7d26d77/6672b81e893c8.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

That points tally always has been enough to advance in the 24-team Euros format.\n\nStill, England can finish in any position from first to third in the Group C standings after playing unbeaten Slovenia next Wednesday.\n\nThe teams had royal watchers from the stands with the king of Denmark, Frederik X, and future king of England, Prince William, at the game.\n\nSlovenia drew 1-1 with Serbia earlier, four days after getting the same result against Denmark. Serbia and Denmark also play Wednesday.\n\nA late strike denied Slovenia a first-ever win in a European Championship.\n\nZan Karnicnik's 69th-minute goal put Slovenia on the brink of a historic win until substitute Luka Jovic levelled deep in stoppage time to keep Serbia's chances of advancing to the knockout stage alive.\n\nThe goal sent the Serbia fans into raucous joy, but they also saw them throw flares and other objects onto the field. By that point, the ground around both goals was littered with plastic cups that had rained down from the stands in the final 10 minutes, prompting announcements over the stadium's speakers urging the fans to stop.\n\nThe equalizer was virtually the last action, as the referee blew full-time immediately after the players restarted. The Slovenia players collapsed to the ground in disappointment.\n\n\"Serbs do not die so easily,\" Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic said. \"We do not give up and nor will we. We believe all the way to the end and the reward came for believing.\n\n\"We didn't accept that we would lose to Slovenia tonight; we didn't want to accept this result, and that's why the reward came.\"\n\nIt would have been Slovenia's second win in a major tournament and its first since victory over Algeria in the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"Slovenia has shown that it has a place here at the European Championships,\" Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek said. \"Sports and football can be cruel but I believe karma will play its part for this team. We have played a fair game in an atmosphere for the ages.\n\n\"We have felt disappointment because we know how strong the Serbia players are, how good they are at dead-ball situations. There was a lack of concentration in the last minute but a big thank you to the players for the heart that they have shown in this arena.\"", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://tvnz-1-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/englands-harry-kane-9-celebrates-with-kieran-trippier-12-aft-S6JCOIBYFVFFRFHSOX322SHKVE.jpg?auth=73099ecc1dfd5a7a3db91229bf114a9ab351fd1f3d9b4fc62d3622ccd8839c5a&quality=70&width=600&height=315&focal=512%2C341", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

However, Slovenia valiantly fought back and restored parity 13 minutes from time when Erik Janza's deflected strike flew past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nBoth nations were forced to share the spoils and Slovenia head coach Matjaz Kek felt that it was a \"fair\" result following a game of two \"very different\" halves, with his side ending the contest strongly.\n\nRanked 57th in the world by FIFA, Slovenia are still awaiting their first-ever victory at the European Championship as an independent nation after failing to come out on top in any of their previous three matches at Euro 2000, although one of two draws during that tournament was against Serbia (then playing as Yugoslavia).\n\nSlovenia are unbeaten in their last seven international matches in all competitions, but they have only won one of their last four meetings with Serbia, most recently playing out a 2-2 draw in the UEFA Nations League in June 2022, just seven days after suffering a 4-1 defeat against the same opponent.\n\nSerbia are competing at the European Championship for the first time as an independent nation this summer, but they were unable to claim any points from their opening Group C fixture as they were beaten 1-0 by tournament favourites England last Sunday.\n\nThe Three Lions were deservedly in front in the 13th minute when Jude Bellingham headed home the opening goal, but Serbia gradually grew into the contest and particularly improved in the second half, forcing the Three Lions to soak up pressure for extended periods.\n\nAlthough Serbia ultimately lacked a cutting edge in the final third, registering just one of their six shots on target, manager Dragan Stojkovic was keen to praise the \"bravery\" of his players and felt that his side \"did not deserve to lose\" against a nation ranked 29 places above them in the FIFA standings.\n\nIncluding matches as Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro, Serbia have now won just one of their last 12 European Championship fixtures (D2 L9) and defeat on matchday one leaves them rooted to the foot of Group C, needing at least one victory from their final two group games to realistically give themselves any hope of reaching the knockout rounds.\n\nSerbia's four points accumulated from two Nations League encounters with Slovenia in 2022 should provide Stojkovic's men with an element of confidence heading into Thursday's contest, and they are sure to view this fixture as a must-win match before facing Denmark in their final Group C game on June 25.\n\nSlovenia European Championship form:\n\nD\n\nSlovenia form (all competitions):\n\nWDWWDD\n\nSerbia European Championship form:\n\nL\n\nSerbia form (all competitions):\n\nDLWLWL\n\nTeam News\n\nSlovenia boss Kek could name an unchanged starting lineup for Thursday's match, with last weekend's goalscorer Janza set to continue at left-back and join Jaka Bijol, Vanja Drkusic and Zan Karnicnik in the back four, protecting Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak.\n\nAdam Gnezda Cerin and Timi Max Elsnik are set to links area once again in centre-midfield, although 92-cap Jasmin Kurtic will be pushing for a recall, while Petar Stojanovic and Jan Mlakar are expected to continue on the flanks.\n\nStar striker Benjamin Sesko, who has scored 11 goals in 30 international caps for Slovenia, is set to be joined up front by Andraz Sporar, with Zan Celar and Jan Mlakar providing cover on the substitutes' bench.\n\nAs for Serbia, Filip Kostic has been ruled out of the rest of Euro 2024 after sustaining a knee injury against England, so Filip Mladenovic is set to take his place at left wing-back.\n\nFulham's Sasa Lukic and Sevilla's Nemanja Gudelj could continue in centre-midfield, unless Stojkovic decides to move Sergej Milinkovic-Savic into a deeper role after starting as a number 10 last time out.\n\nShould Milinkovic-Savic play deeper, that would open the door for playmaker Dusan Tadic, who surprisingly began as a substitute against England, to return to the starting lineup and play in behind strikers Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nSlovenia possible starting lineup:\n\nOblak; Karnicnik, Blazic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Gnezda Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko\n\nSerbia possible starting lineup:\n\nV. Milinkovic-Savic; Veljkovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Zivkovic, S. Milinkovic-Savic, Gudelj, Mladenovic; Tadic; Vlahovic, Mitrovic\n\nWe say: Slovenia 1-1 Serbia\n\nSix of the last eight meetings between these two nations have ended as draw, and although both teams will be pushing for a victory on Thursday, a closely-fought contest could be on the cards in Munich.\n\nBoth nations possess star strikers that have the capabilities to cause problems on their day, but whether their threat is enough to power their side to three crucial points remains to be seen.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click

But a draw is more likely", "body": "MUNICH (AP) -- Slovenia faces Serbia on Thursday in Munich in their second Group C match. Serbia is bottom of the group after a narrow 1-0 loss to England in its opener while Slovenia managed a 1-1 draw against Denmark. Kickoff is at 3 p.m. local time (1300 GMT). Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Slovenia will be hopeful of recording its first-ever group stage win to leave it with a good chance of making the knockout stages for the first time.\n\n-- Serbia has advanced out of the group before but when it was competing as Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro. This is its first European Championship as an independent nation.\n\n-- The two teams met at Euro 2000 -- the last time either qualified -- with 10-man Yugoslavia fighting back from three goals down to draw 3-3. Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u0107 was a substitute during that match.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Neither coach has reported any injury concerns.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- There has been little to choose between the teams over the years with six of the eight matches they've played ending in a draw. They have one win apiece.\n\n-- Slovenia is on a seven-match unbeaten run that included a surprise 2-0 win over Portugal in a friendly international in March.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n-- \"We're going to do whatever we can against Slovenia, we have to win that. I congratulate all the players (after the England match), there are no frustrations apart from the result. I don't like losing but it's part of the job.\" Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u0107.\n\n-- \"Many of my players have never played in such a big competition. When we saw something was possible (against Denmark), they started playing.\" Slovenia coach Matja\u017e Kek.\n\n-- \" How we start is important and we want to set the tone from the beginning. We are the tallest team at the Euro and we need to be even more dangerous from set-pieces.\" Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovi\u0107.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia and Montenegro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Milenkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Milenkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matja\u017e_Kek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matja\u017e Kek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/3a/73a35d2b-90a3-539f-aefa-1cbb46d09ae5/6672b63f0b0f1.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The Slovenia players collapsed to the ground in disappointment.\n\nIt also would have been their first win in a major tournament since victory over Algeria in the 2010 World Cup.\n\nSlovenia plays England in its final group match on Tuesday, when Serbia faces Denmark. Serbia lost to England in their opener.\n\nWith both teams needing a win to boost their chances of progressing, the match started at a fast pace and Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovi\u0107 had to make two early saves.\n\nThose two shots on target in the first eight minutes were as many as Slovenia had in total in its drew with Denmark.\n\nSerbia withstood the waves of Slovenia attacks and had its first chance in the 27th minute but Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107's header was straight at goalkeeper Jan Oblak.\n\nSerbia went even closer moments later when Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 whipped in a fabulous corner to the far post but Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 -- who scored in his previous two matches against Slovenia -- couldn't get a proper touch.\n\nThe best chance of the half fell to Slovenia in somewhat fortunate circumstances. Timi El\u0161nik tried to pass to a teammate but the ball came off a Serbia defender and fell kindly back to him for a thunderous effort which crashed off the right post. Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko fired the rebound woefully over.\n\nSerbia started the second half with three great chances to break the deadlock inside the first five minutes, including Slovenia defender Jake Bijol almost scoring an own goal.\n\nThis tournament has seen plenty of stunning long-range goals and there was almost another in the 58th but Rajkovi\u0107 did well to push \u0160e\u0161ko's strike over the bar.\n\nSlovenia eventually broke the deadlock with a move started and finished by \u017dan Karni\u010dnik. The defender won the ball deep inside his own half and ran some 40 yards before picking out El\u0161nik on the left and racing into the box to collect the cross and tap home at the back post.\n\nSerbia almost levelled immediately but El\u0161nik hit the crossbar.\n\nSerbia threw everything at Slovenia in the final stages. Even Rajkovi\u0107 came up for the final corner but it was Jovi\u0107 who leapt highest to head it past Oblak in the fifth minute of added time.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniella_matar@register-herald.com", "name": "Daniella Matar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du\u0161an_Tadi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Mitrovi\u0107_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du\u0161an_Vlahovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predrag_Rajkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predrag Rajkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Jovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Jovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017dan_Karni\u010dnik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u017dan Karni\u010dnik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timi_Max_El\u0161nik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timi Max El\u0161nik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_\u0160e\u0161ko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaka_Bijol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaka Bijol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/5c/f5c3c3f2-5188-5d54-9cbd-75ff49839ed2/667446e4219c2.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

2024", "body": "Munich (Germany) (AFP) - Luka Jovic scored with a last-gasp header to snatch an equaliser for Serbia in a 1-1 draw with Slovenia on Thursday, keeping both teams in contention for a place in the last 16 of Euro 2024.\n\nSlovenia looked on course for their first ever win at the tournament after Zan Karnicnik put them ahead in the second half, but Jovic glanced in a corner in the fifth minute of stoppage time to haul Serbia level.\n\nThe result leaves Slovenia on two points from two games in Group C going into their clash with England on Tuesday, while Serbia have one point ahead of their final match in the group against Denmark.\n\nSerbia coach Dragan Stojkovic, who felt his team showed England \"too much respect\" in their opening 1-0 defeat, recalled captain Dusan Tadic in one of three changes, with Filip Kostic ruled out due to injury.\n\nStojkovic incidentally played in Yugoslavia's 3-3 draw with Slovenia in the group stage at Euro 2000, Slovenia's only other appearance at the tournament.\n\nBut it was Slovenia, coming off a creditable 1-1 draw against Euro 2020 semi-finalists Denmark in their first game, who created the early chances.\n\nAdam Gnezda Cerin drove straight at Predrag Rajkovic from distance before the Serbia goalkeeper used his legs well to save from Jan Mlakar.\n\nAfter mustering a solitary shot on target against England, Serbia's strike pair Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic both went close.\n\nVlahovic's diving header drew an easy save from Jan Oblak, with Mitrovic unable to connect with Tadic's teasing corner yards out as he grappled with a defender.\n\nTimi Max Elsnik rattled the post after skipping his way into the Serbia area following a favourable bounce off an opponent and Benjamin Sesko scooped over the rebound.\n\nOblak, who produced a crucial stop to keep Slovenia in the game before they equalised against Denmark, pulled off another similar save just before half-time to deny Mitrovic from inside the six-yard box.\n\nMitrovic again found his route to goal blocked by Oblak minutes into the second half, with Slovenia defender Jaka Bijol lucky not to slice a cross into his own net.\n\nA header from Mitrovic deflected just over as Serbia started to impose themselves on the game, but Sesko kept Rajkovic busy with a curling attempt.\n\nKarnicnik started and finished the move that led to Slovenia's goal, winning the ball back deep in his half and igniting the counter-attack that culminated in him stabbing in Elsnik's cross from the left.\n\nMitrovic's luck deserted him as the Al Hilal forward whacked the crossbar, his half-volley from Andrija Zivkovic's delivery taking a vital touch off Karnicnik.\n\nLazar Samardzic stroked wide as Serbia desperately pushed for an equaliser, their prayers answered as Jovic turned in a corner with the final act of the match.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And is a draw enough?\n\nGareth Southgate's side are top of Group C with three ahead of their clash with Denmark\n\nJude Bellingham scored the only goal of the game as England beat Serbia 1-0 last Sunday\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: What Jude Bellingham must do to elevate his game LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

Likewise, Denmark would only be able to get three more if they lost today, taking them to four in total.\n\nSo a win is enough to qualify today, however it does not necessarily confirm group winner status.\n\nFor that, they are relying on Slovenia not beating Serbia - i.e. a win for England, and a win or draw for Serbia, and Southgate and Co are through as top dogs in the group.\n\nA win for England tonight, and Slovenia failing to beat Serbia, puts England through top\n\nWhat if England draw?\n\nBut what if England draw, I hear you asking, pitchforks within reach. Well, it wouldn't actually be the end of the world.\n\nSeven points would be enough to take England through top of the group, as Denmark would only be able to muster a maximum total of five (one win, two draws), Serbia six (two wins, one defeat), while Slovenia could only get four if England beat them on Tuesday (one win, one draw, one defeat).\n\nSo if England draw with Denmark and beat Slovenia they're through top. But what if they draw tonight and lose to Slovenia? A draw certainly piles the pressure on heading into that last game.\n\nA draw tonight could leave the group looking like this:\n\nSo they wouldn't be out by any stretch, but they would need at least a draw in their final game, and hope for a better goal difference than Denmark if they beat Serbia in the final game given England and Denmark would be drawing in this eventuality, and so head to head would not matter.\n\nIf Serbia beat Slovenia\n\nEngland 4pts\n\nSerbia 3pts\n\nDenmark 2pts\n\nSlovenia 1pt\n\nAdvertisement If Slovenia beat Serbia\n\nSlovenia 4pts\n\nEngland 4pts\n\nDenmark 2pts\n\nSerbia 0pts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngland are considered the front-runners to go all the way in Germany despite not having won a tournament since 1966\n\nA draw against Denmark complicates matters, but England could still qualify top of the group\n\nWhat if England lose tonight?\n\nWell... again, although Southgate would likely begin to feel a little more heat than usual, England would still be able to go through top of the group if they can beat Slovenia.\n\nDefeat tonight and victory for Slovenia (likely the worst case scenario) puts the latter on four, and Denmark would also be on four, with whoever scores more goals tonight likely sitting top.\n\nEngland would be down on three - crucially just the one point behind - and Serbia bottom on none.\n\nTherefore, a loss tonight, but a win over Slovenia, and Denmark not beating Serbia on the final day, and England are still through on top with six points. Important to remember, even if things don't go to plan tonight.\n\nA loss tonight and against Slovenia, Slovenia beating Serbia tonight, and Denmark beating Serbia, would leave Slovenia and Denmark both on seven, England on three and Serbia on nothing, with the Three Lions relying on qualifying as a best third-placed team.\n\nIt's a lot to get your heads around, but essentially: England win tonight, they're through. England win tonight and Slovenia fail to beat Serbia, and they're through as winners.\n\nA draw tonight is not the end of the world, but they would need to beat Slovenia to be sure of going through top, while two draws would need the Three Lions requiring results to go their way, and they could potentially find themselves in a three-way fight on five points with Slovenia and Denmark.\n\nSimilarly, defeat tonight is not the end of the world - though it may probably feel like it - and England can still top the group. Two losses make things somewhat more interesting, but let's not worry about that one too much just yet.\n\nA win over Benjamin Sesko's Slovenia on Tuesday would see England go through top even if they lose to Denmark\n\nWho could England face in the Last-16?\n\nIn the spirit of getting ahead of ourselves, let's indulge in a bit of running before we can walk.\n\nShould all go to plan, England will win Group C, which draws them against the third-placed side in Groups D, E or F - at the time of writing those are Poland, Belgium and Czechia, though Austria, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Georgia are also likely contenders.\n\nCome second in the group, and that could tee up clashes with the winners of Group A, which for all intents and purposes would be Germany, who have six points, seven goals, and a whole heap of plaudits from two games. It wouldn't exactly be ideal.\n\nFinish third, and qualify as one of the four best third-placed sides, and England would take on the winners of either Group E or Group F - at the moment looking like Portugal or Belgium going of FIFA rankings, so maybe third place is a better option then second?", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

Although there might be repercussions for the team that go beyond this remarkable day. Their fans caused trouble in the second half here in Munich, pelting the Slovenia players with bottles in the second half and then throwing flares onto the pitch.\n\nOne of those flares was even lit before the equaliser had been converted, in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Perhaps the Serbian supporters could sense what was coming. More likely is that they thought they had better use the pyrotechnic while they could -- despite repeated warnings before the match that such fireworks would not be permitted.\n\nA few hours before kickoff, Serbia had threatened to quit the tournament after accusing Croatia and Albania fans of chanting \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" in Hamburg on Wednesday. When the decisive goal arrived from the head of Luka Jovic, though, not one person in Serbian red was thinking about going home. It was a goal that kept their journey alive, and they luxuriated in it.\n\nFor Slovenia, it represented the most sickening of setbacks. Seconds from victory, they had once again shown themselves to be an organised, disciplined and talented team. Now they must face England, the strongest team in the group, with only two points on the table.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic wasted a few really good chances during the game, although Jan Oblak was on hand to deny him with a couple of crucial saves.\n\nSlovenia thought they were about to get across the line, only to be denied by Luka Jovic's last-second equaliser:\n\nOn the 70-minute mark, Slovenia took the lead through right-back Zan Karnicnik:\n\nLet us go back to the two crucial moments in the game...\n\nEngland have named an unchanged line-up for their game against Denmark, which kicks off at 17.00 BST. If you want to follow all the build-up, you can go over to our live blog right here.\n\nThat was the final act of the game and Serbia escape with a point. Despair for Slovenia.\n\nSerbia are level in the dying embers of the game. They are given a late corner and Jovic heads it into the bottom corner. Heartbreak for Slovenia, Serbia keep their hopes alive.\n\nGacinovic is the latest Serbia player to be booked.\n\nUnfortunately plenty of plastic cups are being thrown onto the pitch by the Serbian fans at the end where Slovenia are defending.\n\nSerbia are having all the possession but time is running out. They do not even look like scoring here.\n\nJovic, not long after being booked, attempts an acrobatic effort but ends up being penalised.\n\nIt is tense in Munich as we approach the 90-minute mark. This current scoreline has huge ramifications for both sides.\n\nThe corner is sent in and Oblak punches it to the edge of the box. The shot is fired back in by Ilic but it is blocked.\n\nBirmancevic is fouled on the left-hand side and this is a good chance for Serbia to whip it into the box.\n\nIt is sent in and Oblak, rather unconvincingly, gets a hand on it but it ends up going behind for a corner. The delivery is sent in but it goes behind for another corner...\n\nSamardzic has only just come on and he comes close to getting Serbia level. He dribbles across the box and eventually gets his shot away. He drags it slightly too much and the chance goes begging.\n\nThe goalscorer Karnicnik is full of confidence and tries to find the far corner, but his shot goes narrowly wide.\n\nTime is running out for Serbia as we head into the final 10 minutes. As it stands they are facing two straight defeats to start the tournament.\n\nTadic finds Milinkovi&cacute;-Savi&cacute;, whose header goes wide. Serbia appeal for a corner and the replays show it should have been but a goal-kick is given.\n\nSerbia have a free-kick in a central position, around 25 yards out. Their captain Tadic will take...\n\nMitrovic hits the bar! We were wondering how Serbia would respond and they are nearly immediately level. Mitrovic volleys a cross first time and it comes crashing back off the bar. How has Mitrovic not scored today?\n\nFinally the breakthrough and it is Slovenia who get it. The cross is sent in from the left by Elsnik and Karnicnik is on hand to tap it home at the far stick. 1-0 and the Slovenian fans are sent into a state of delirium.\n\nFabulous goal! Half of the Allianz Arena is bouncing. It's a big ground, this, and it's rocking.\n\nZan Karnicnik started the move near his own corner flag, winning the ball deep in his own half, and just kept running. The Serbian defenders were so worried about the two strikers that they forgot about the right-back at the back post.\n\nKarnicnik has then just prevented a certain goal by deflecting Mitrovic's close-range effort onto the bar. What a few minutes for him.\n\nStojanovic goes down on the right-hand side of the box after contact with Pavlovic but the referee is having none of it. Stojanovic looks perplexed but no penalty is coming his way.\n\nMitrovic volleys one from the edge of the box but he cannot keep his effort down and it goes flying over the bar.\n\nAs against England, Serbia took their time to warm up today. They produced a truly dreadful start to this game, but now they are the better team in Munich.\n\nSlovenia will be thankful for the brilliance of Jan Oblak in goal. There is a reason the Atletico Madrid is regarded as one of the finest goalkeepers in the world, and he demonstrated all of his shot-stopping ability when denying Mitrovic shortly after the break.\n\nSerbia are learning what Denmark realised earlier in the tournament: Slovenia are a tough nut to crack.\n\nSesko comes close to giving Slovenia the lead. He cuts onto his right foot and curls one from around 25 yards out. Rajkovic gets his hand to do it to tip it over the bar for a Slovenia corner. They try a fancy routine but Serbia manage to clear their lines.\n\nFulham midfielder Lukic is booked for a body-check on Stojnovic.\n\nVery nearly an own goal by Bijol. Gacinovic, who only came on at half-time, sends in a dangerous cross the left and Bijol swings his foot towards it. He slices his attempted clearance and it nearly ends up in his own net but goes just past the far post.\n\nMoments later Tadic sends in a dangerous cross, which finds Mitrovic. His header takes a deflection and goes behind for another Serbia corner.\n\nSlovenia were the better side in the first half but Serbia have certainly started the second half more brightly.\n\nBig chance for Mitrovic right at the start of the second half. He plays a one-two with Tadic and drives into the box. He tries to lift it over Oblak but the Atletico keeper is quick off his line and makes the save to deny the former Fulham striker. Mitrovic has now had a couple of big chances in this game.\n\nWe are back under way in Munich. It remains goalless but still 45 minutes ahead so hopefully we will see goals in this second half.\n\nAhead of England's match against Denmark at 17.00 BST, which you can follow all the build-up to here, as it stands England would remain top, one point above Slovenia.\n\nI can't shake the feeling that Slovenia might live to regret their missed chances in this first half... they have had four good opportunities now, but the momentum of the game is beginning to swing away from them. After a dreadful start, Serbia are creating chances of their own. The match is coming alive.\n\nThere is the whistle and we are all square at the break in Munich.\n\nWe have one added minute and Serbia have a late corner. After the corner is taken short, Mitrovic is found at the far post but his header goes wide. That should be it for the first half.\n\nIt is end-to-end at the moment. At one end Lukic has a shot blocked and then Slovenia race up the other end and have a corner of their own.\n\nThe delivery is sent in by Gnezda Cerin but it is punched away.\n\nBig chance for Serbia. Mitrovic has a great chance to give Serbia the lead. Zivkovic sends in a cross from the right all the way to the far post, where Mitrovic is too strong for his marker. Oblak though is quick to get out and make the save to deny Serbia.\n\nIt looks like it would have been ruled out anyway as Zivkovic was offside before he sent the cross in.\n\nSerbia have a free-kick in a central position around 25 yards which Vlahovic takes, but he hits it straight into the wall.\n\nSlovenia hit the post. Elsnik gets a little lucky that a failed one-two comes straight back to him. He goes past a defender and then hits a powerful shot, which comes back off the post.\n\nThen it comes to Sesko, who tries to curl one into the top corner but misses the target.\n\nNot long after Vlahovic wants a free-kick just outside the box, Serbia have a corner. Tadic whips in a great delivery and it comes to the far post. Mitrovic stoops down to get his head on it but it loops over the bar. There were appeals for handball but those were waved away.\n\nChance for Serbia and their best and only chance so far. Ilic sends in a cross from the left and Vlahovic does well to stoop down to get his head on it. It is a decent effort but straight at Oblak and a goalkeeper of that calibre will not let that in.\n\nWe have the first yellow card of the game and it goes to Serbia. Mladenovic goes sliding in on Karnicnik and the referee is left in no doubt.\n\nSlovenia are the better team here, dominating the ball and creating the only clear chances so far. Serbia are really struggling to get a foothold in the game and their front three appear totally undecided on how to press. What should their shape be? Who should be marking who? I get the impression that they don't really know.\n\nSlovenia have a corner on the left, which will be taken by Gnezda Cerin. They take it short and eventually Janza sends it in but the delivery is too loopy and it is an easy catch for Rajkovic.\n\nJanza, Slovenia's goalscorer in their opening game, sends in a dangerous cross from the left which just evades his teammates in the centre. Rajkovic just got his fingertips to it to push it away from goal.\n\nThe ball is played over the top of the Serbian defence and they do not deal with it with any conviction. In the end Rajkovic just about snaffles it but that was a nervy moment for Serbia.\n\nFirst big chance of the match and it falls Slovenia's way. Sesko's cushioned header just outside the box finds Mlakar, who drives into the box and shoots powerfully towards goal. Rajkovic is on hand to make the save to deny Slovenia.\n\nGnezda Cerin has the first effort of the match. Serbia lose possession in their own half and Gnezda Cerin shoots from distance but it is straight at Rajkovic.\n\nIt is certainly noisy in Munich this afternoon. Plenty of hissing when Slovenia have possession.\n\nWe are under way in Munich.\n\nBoth sides have emerged from the tunnel in Munich and it is time for the national anthems.\n\nSerbia: Rajkovic; Veljkovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Zivkovic, Ilic, Lukic, Mladenovic; Tadic; Vlahovic, Mitrovic.\n\nSubstitutes: Stojic, Maksimovic, Gudelj, Jovic, Kostic, Petrovic, Babic, Mijailovic, Ratkov, Samardzic, S Milinkovic-Savic, Gacinovic, V Milinkovic-Savic, Spajic, Birmancevic.\n\nSlovenia: Oblak; Karnicnik, Drkusic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko.\n\nSubstitutes: Balkovec, Blazic, Stankovic, Verbic, Lovric, Belec, Kurtic, Horvat, Vekic, Vipotnik, Celar, Brekalo, Zugelj, Zeljkovic, Ilicic.\n\nSlovenia have more points on the board than Serbia after the first round of matches but this feels more like a must-win game for them than it does for Aleksandar Mitrovic and the boys in red. With England to come in their final group game, you would think this is Slovenia's best chance of winning a match. (Or is that English arrogance speaking?)\n\nSerbia, meanwhile, face Denmark in their final group game. They really cannot lose this one, but a draw might not be disastrous for Dragan Stojkovic's team.\n\nAway from the permutations, this should be a fun battle of the big strikers. Both teams play with two centre-forwards and all four of those players are powerful units. For Serbia it is Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic. For Slovenia it is Andraz Sporar and Benjamin Sesko, the supremely talented 21-year-old.\n\nSesko twice went close to scoring sensational long-range efforts against Denmark. Perhaps he will have more luck today.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic. The goals have still continued despite swapping the Premier League for the Saudi Pro League and he will be expected to deliver for his country this summer. With 39 goals in 43 matches for club and country this season, you would not bet against him.\n\nSerbia play in a 3-4-2-1 formation with Mitrovic the focal point in attack and Dusan Tadic and Fulham's Sasa Lukic just in behind. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic brings the physicality from midfield with the pace coming from Filip Kostic in a make-shift wing-back position.\n\nTheir chances of getting out of the group will depend on their final match against Denmark and with them falling short on the biggest stage in their recent history, it could be more of the same. Group stage.\n\nHaving already caught the attention of Premier League sides, including Arsenal, with his performances for RB Leipzig, all eyes will be on how far striker Benjamin Sesko, 20, can carry Slovenia after scoring five goals in nine matches during qualifying.\n\nThroughout qualifying Slovenia fielded a standard 4-4-2 formation with target-man Andraz Sporar complimenting Sesko's raw pace and direct style. Expect them to be strong on the counter and successful in a low block.\n\nAfter finishing only second to Denmark on head-to-head in qualifying, Kek will fancy his side's chances of escaping the group but Serbia's attack should be enough to see them finish last. Group stage.\n\nBetting on the game? Take a look at these Euros betting offers and free bets.\n\nAhead of today's game, the Head of the Serbian FA has said his team will refuse to remain at the tournament unless the Croatian and Albanian FAs are punished after accusing the Croatia and Albania fans of chanting \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" in Hamburg yesterday.\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to our live blog from day seven at Euro 2024. Munich is the stage as Slovenia take on Serbia in the second round of group-stage games in Group C.\n\nSerbia were beaten 1-0 by England in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday night. Slovenia manager Dragan Stojkovic believes his side showed too much respect to England on Sunday.\n\n\"Against England we started playing with too much respect for them, like they came from another planet. It should not be like that. We played better against them later in the match and that's how we'll play against Slovenia.\"\n\nSlovenia fell behind to Denmark but equalised through Erik Janza with just over ten minutes to go to take a point from their opening game. With four of the third-placed teams going through into the knockout stages, every point is vital and the door is open. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, who has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs, will lead the line for Slovenia, with Atletico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak another key figure for them.\n\nSlovenia are looking to build on the point against Denmark and manager Matjaz Kek is hoping his side can show what they are made of against Serbia this afternoon.\n\n\"This team will grow from minute to minute in these surroundings. It's too optimistic to expect too much from this team, bigger teams have failed. We all want to achieve a positive result and we want to prove tomorrow that we deserve to be here, that we qualified for Germany on merit.\"\n\nSix of the previous eight matches between Slovenia and Serbia in all competitions have ended in a draw, with each side winning once apiece in the other two matches. The two sides last met in the Uefa Nations League, in June 2022, with Serbia winning 4-1 in Belgrade before a 2-2 draw in Ljubljana a week later.\n\nTeam news to follow shortly.", "source": {"uri":

It took a fair while for the Group C encounter between Slovenia and Serbia in Munich today (Thursday) to ignite, but it eventually delivered the now-customary drama.\n\nAs they were against England, Serbia were subdued in the first half, with Slovenia the more aggressive and impressive side. What chances Serbia did create were invariably squandered by Aleksandar Mitrovic, which almost proved costly when Zan Karnicnik put Slovenia 1-0 up with 20 minutes to go. But a last-gasp equaliser from Luka Jovic -- his first international goal since 2022 -- saved a point for Serbia and leaves Group C wide open before England play Denmark later today.\n\nHere, Seb Stafford-Bloor and Peter Rutzler break down some of the talking points from the game.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic does not have much to prove in a Serbia shirt. He is the country's all-time record goalscorer, and it is his goals that have taken Serbia to major tournaments. But against Slovenia, he could not find his midas touch.\n\nSix chances were passed up against Slovenia. The best of which came just before half-time, when Andrija Zivkovic, a fellow graduate from Partizan Belgrade, picked him out at the back post with a well-flighted cross. Instead of shooting first time, he opted to take a touch, narrowing his angle to shoot against Jan Oblak, who saved well.\n\nThat lack of sharpness and acting on instinct would tell the story of his afternoon. Mitrovic had a quiet game against England on matchday one, but the return of captain Dusan Tadic was always likely to produce better opportunities for him. The pair have a good relationship and understanding, and that came to the fore in the second half. Tadic picked out Mitrovic twice for good chances; the first saw Mitrovic break through on goal, only to be denied by Oblak again. Then, shortly afterwards, Tadiz fizzed a perfect cross onto Mitrovic's forehead, but he could not find the target.\n\nThe ball simply would not go in for him and that was underlined when his volley was blocked by Slovenia scorer Karnicnik onto the bar on 72 minutes.\n\nSerbia needed to win against Slovenia. But despite their attacking riches, which also included Dusan Vlahovic and substitute Luka Jovic, they simply could not find a route to goal. Their overall play has improved in the second half but they were poor in the final third. They either lacked composure in front of goal -- notably Mitrovic -- or with the final pass, until a late, late equaliser from Jovic broke Slovenian hearts.\n\nBenjamin Sesko's rumoured valuation and the clubs who expressed an interest in him earlier in the summer reflected his potential more than his current status in the game. Sesko is going to be a wonderful player, but he is not quite there yet.\n\nHis role in this Slovenian team was a reminder that he is still the type of forward who needs service, and who does not have the all-round game yet to force his will on games. Behind him, his teammates' ball-movement was frequently good, especially in the first half. Serbia had difficulty shutting off the right-sided channel in their own half, and yet passing options towards Sesko were typically closed off, and the crosses that did arrow towards the box were not able to find him in any space.\n\nFor now, he remains a system player -- and that is interesting in itself. Going between RB Leipzig's ultra-quick 4-2-2-2, with its quick, vertical actions, and Slovenia's more cautious 4-4-2 shows him in a different light.\n\nHe was good at Allianz Arena and worked extremely hard. Late in the first half, he dropped deep to receive a pass out of defence which, inevitably, led to him being clattered from behind. It was typical of a blue-collared performance and reflective of his tactical responsibility. It came at a moment when his defenders needed relief and he put himself in position to provide it.\n\nBut his best moment came from a counter-attack just before the hour, when he was part of a three-on-three breakaway. The move ended with his curling shot being tipped over the bar, but as a sequence it was extremely \"RB\" and it suited him.\n\nSo, Sesko is excellent, but -- internationally at least -- he's still not quite able to define the games in which he plays.\n\nSeb Stafford-Bloor\n\nThere were worrying signs for Serbia long before they fell behind. In the first half, Slovenia had plenty of joy moving the ball through the midfield, and the amount of space they were able to find was suggestive of a technical problem.\n\nAs was the Serbian body language. More than once in the first half, their players remonstrated with one another, in an attempt to clarify positioning issues or demand changes to the rhythm of their passing.\n\nDusan Tadic was especially active. When Slovenia hit the post before half time, he marched back among his defenders, pointing and gesticulating, and trying to better organise the team around him.\n\nOne of the stranger spectacles of the afternoon was seeing that drama unfold while, whenever he got the chance in his technical area, head coach Dragan Stojkovic, who is one of the finest Serbian players of all time, but less loved as a manager, did the occasional trick with the ball.\n\nIt was all quite odd. It was also fitting that when Slovenia's goal arrived, courtesy of a lovely flowing move through the middle of the pitch, it owed much to the absence of Serbian players who were not where they should have been and a lack of resistance through the middle of the pitch.\n\nSerbia, it seems, are a team that only seem to function in the second half.\n\nTheir first half display against Slovenia was reminiscent of their showing against England on matchday one. For 30 minutes, England looked like worldbeaters and Serbia were comprehensively outplayed. Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic lamented afterwards that his side gave England too much respect in their 1-0 defeat. \"Like they came from another planet,\" he said. In the second half, they pushed England back and ultimately, Gareth Southgate's side had to hang on for the win.\n\nWith Slovenia essentially a must-win game, the expectation was that Serbia would start the game far more positively but in the end, Stojkovic's side produced a repeat performance. They were far too passive in the first half, dropping into a 5-4-1 defensive shape and applying very little pressure off the ball. Slovenia, meanwhile, had better control of the game, and they condensed central areas smartly while finding joy on the overlap -- particularly as Dusan Vlahovic and Dusan Tadic were tasked with covering those wide positions when out of possession.\n\nBut just like against England, Serbia improved after the break and while they left it late, and after a flurry of missed chances, they did merit their point.\n\nIf they want to progress however, they need to be consistent for 90 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "more@nytimes.com", "name": "more", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sebastian_stafford_bloor@nytimes.com", "name": "Sebastian Stafford-Bloor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du\u0161an_Tadi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Half-time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Partizan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FK Partizan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/20110804/GettyImages-2157842963-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-02-02", "textStart": 3440, "textEnd": 3447}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Here\u00b4s what to know about the match:\n\n- Slovenia will be hopeful of recording its first-ever group stage win to leave it with a good chance of making the knockout stages for the first time.\n\n- Serbia has advanced out of the group before but when it was competing as Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro. This is its first European Championship as an independent nation.\n\n- The two teams met at Euro 2000 - the last time either qualified - with 10-man Yugoslavia fighting back from three goals down to draw 3-3. Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u00b4c was a substitute during that match.\n\n- Neither coach has reported any injury concerns.\n\n- There has been little to choose between the teams over the years with six of the eight matches they've played ending in a draw. They have one win apiece.\n\nSlovenia's head coach Matjaz Kek listens to his team national anthem just ahead of the start of the Group C match between Slovenia and Denmark at the Euro 2024 soccer tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, Sunday, June 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)\n\n- Slovenia is on a seven-match unbeaten run that included a surprise 2-0 win over Portugal in a friendly international in March.\n\n- \"We\u00b4re going to do whatever we can against Slovenia, we have to win that. I congratulate all the players (after the England match), there are no frustrations apart from the result. I don\u00b4t like losing but it\u00b4s part of the job.\" Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u00b4c.\n\n- \"Many of my players have never played in such a big competition. When we saw something was possible (against Denmark), they started playing.\" Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek.\n\n- \" How we start is important and we want to set the tone from the beginning. We are the tallest team at the Euro and we need to be even more dangerous from set-pieces.\" Serbia defender Nikola Milenkovi\u00b4c.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024\n\nSerbia's head coach Dragan Stojkovic, left, gestures as England's Bukayo Saka, second right, fights for the ball with Serbia's Strahinja Pavlovic, right, and Serbia's Filip Mladenovic during a Group C match between Serbia and England at the Euro 2024 soccer tournament in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, Sunday, June 16, 2024.

Channel, start time and how to watch Euro 2024 fixture online tomorrow", "body": "Slovenia and Serbia face off in a crucial Euro 2024 match as both look to consolidate their positions in Group C.\n\nSlovenia drew 1-1 in an impressive performance against Denmark in their opening match, with Erik Janza scoring an equaliser late on after Christian Eriksen had scored a dream opener three years after suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020.\n\nThat result put them one point above Serbia, who lost 1-0 in a tense encounter against England in Gelsenkirchen. They recovered well after a poor first half, but couldn't find an equaliser despite great efforts from Dusan Vlahovic and accomplished performances from Mladenovic, Kostic and others.\n\nThat results means that Slovenia, Serbia and Denmark all sit within one point of each other in Group C, making every result, and potentially every goal, vitally important as they battle to see who finishes second and third.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group C fixture.\n\nWhen is Slovenia v Serbia?\n\nThe match will kick off at 2pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nSlovenia v Serbia will be shown live on ITV 1 and ITV X with coverage starting at 1pm. You can find a full list of which channel is showing each match here.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market. Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nSlovenia have no fresh injury concerns after their opening game, so expect a similar line-up to the one that started their draw against Denmark.\n\nBenjamin Sesko remains the talisman, with Oblak the undroppable 'keeper and goalscorer Janza likely to keep his place at left-back.\n\nFor Serbia, winger Filip Kostic limped off in the first half of the loss against England, so he will be a doubt, but there are no other injury concerns.\n\nSerbia's defence, especially Pavlovic, were run ragged at times in the first half against England, and though they recovered well, that may be the area in which changes are made. Players such as Milinkovic-Savic, Vlahovic and Mitrovic remain undroppable, though Tadic might come in to the starting side against a weaker opposition, and Mladenovic impressed during his cameo after replacing Kostic.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nSerbia: Rajkovic; Veljkovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Zivkovic, Lukic, Gudelj, Kostic; Vlahovic, Milinkovic-Savic; Mitrovic.\n\nSlovenia: Oblak; Karnicnik, Drkusic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko.\n\nBoth sides performed well in parts of their opening matches, with Serbia unlucky to not get the equaliser against England and Slovenia performing well in the second half of their draw against Denmark. Nevertheless, Serbia have far more star quality in their ranks, both in attack and midfield, so they should grab a vital three points.

Both teams must play a must-win game to keep themselves alive in the competition and are separated by just a point in the points table.\n\nWith the memory of a loss against Denmark still fresh, Slovenia is gearing up for a crucial match. Erik Janza has kept his team's hopes alive after scoring in the 77th minute in a game mostly dominated by the Danish.\n\nSlovenia haven't played in the European Championship since 2000, and their draw against Denmark in Stuttgart was their first participation in a major tournament since the 2010 World Cup. Currently, Slovenia stand 57th in the Fifa rankings and is yet to win a European Championship game. They arrive in this tournament unbeaten from seven international games in all competitions but have just registered one win in these seven matches.\n\nSerbia lost their previous game against England 1-0. England threatened Serbia's defence from the early minutes of the match, and though Serbia played a solid game, they were dominated by England throughout the game.\n\nSerbia were a much better side in the second half and managed to put England under pressure. However, they still lacked a cutting edge in the final third, registering just one of their six shots on target. As a free nation, this is Serbia's first time playing in this competition. Their defeat on Match Day 1 means they must register one win from their next two games to give them an outside chance to qualify for knockouts.\n\nSerbia will consider this fixture against Slovenia a must-win before facing Denmark in their final Group C fixture. Serbia's last two games against Slovenia have resulted in a 4-1 win and a 2-2 draw, which means they will head into Thursday's game with more confidence.\n\nSlovenia manager Matjaz Kek may keep an unchanged lineup for their Thursday game. The previous game's goalscorer, Janza, will feature as the left-back and will be joined by Jaka Bijol, Vanja Drkusic and Zan Karnicnik as the back four, giving solid support to Atletico Madrid goalkeeper and team captain Jan Oblak.\n\nAdam Gnezda Cerin and Tim Max Elsnik will again feature in the centre-midfield, with Petar Stojanovic and Jan Mlakar expected to continue their role in the Flank. There are rumours that Jasmin Kurtic, with his 92-cap appearance for the team, will also look to push for his selection.\n\nBenjamin Sesko, who has scored 11 goals in 30 international appearances for the team, will be joined in front by Andraz Sporar.\n\nIn the Serbian camp, Filip Kostic has been ruled out for the rest of the Euro 2024 after sustaining a knee injury in their game against England. Filip Mladenovic is likely to replace him as the left wing-back. Sasa Lukic of Fulham and Nemanja Gudel of Sevilla are expected to continue in the centre-midfield. This may change if Dragan Stojkovi\u0107 decides to move Sergej Milinkovic-Savic into a deeper role, having previously started as a number 10.\n\nThis could consequently open the door for playmaker Dusan Tadic, who featured against England as a substitute. The Serbian captain will play behind strikers Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic if the Serbian captain returns to the starting lineup.\n\nSlovenia and Serbia have won a game against each other and played one draw. Both are balanced in their competition against each other. Slovenia looked in better form in their clash against Denmark. They also have a point to their name in the Group C points table. Serbia, though, have played more dominating games against Slovenia in the last two games these teams locked horns. Both these teams will hope to give themselves a chance to qualify for the knockouts.\n\nSlovenia: Oblak; Karnicnik, Blazic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Gnezda Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko\n\nSerbia possible: V.

For many the match was over but for us it was not,\" said Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic.\n\nSlovenia are on two points from two games in Group C going into their clash with England on Tuesday, while Serbia have one point ahead of their final match in the section against Denmark.\n\n\"Sport in general and football can be cruel but I believe karma will do its part for this team,\" said Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek.\n\nSerbia boss Stojkovic, who felt his team showed England \"too much respect\" in their opening 1-0 defeat, recalled captain Dusan Tadic in one of three changes, with Filip Kostic ruled out due to injury.\n\nA former international midfielder, Stojkovic incidentally played in Yugoslavia's 3-3 draw with Slovenia in the group stage at Euro 2000, Slovenia's only other appearance at the tournament.\n\nBut it was Slovenia, coming off a creditable 1-1 draw against Euro 2020 semi-finalists Denmark in their first game, who created the early chances.\n\nAdam Gnezda Cerin drove straight at Predrag Rajkovic from distance before the Serbia goalkeeper used his legs to save well from Jan Mlakar.\n\nAfter mustering a solitary shot on target against England, Serbia's strike pair of Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic both went close.\n\nVlahovic's diving header drew an easy save from Jan Oblak, with Mitrovic unable to connect with Tadic's teasing corner yards out as he grappled with a defender.\n\nElsnik hits upright\n\nTimi Max Elsnik rattled the post after skipping his way into the Serbia area following a favourable bounce off an opponent and Benjamin Sesko scooped over the rebound.\n\nOblak, who produced a crucial stop to keep Slovenia in the game before they equalised against Denmark, pulled off another similar save just before half-time to deny Mitrovic from inside the six-yard box.\n\nMitrovic again found his route to goal blocked by Oblak minutes into the second half, with Slovenia defender Jaka Bijol lucky not to slice a cross into his own net.\n\nA header from Mitrovic deflected just over as Serbia started to impose themselves on the game, but Sesko kept Rajkovic busy with a curling attempt.\n\nKarnicnik started and finished the move that led to Slovenia's goal, winning the ball back deep in his half and igniting the counter-attack that culminated in him stabbing in Elsnik's cross from the left.\n\nMitrovic's luck deserted him as the Al Hilal forward whacked the crossbar, his half-volley from Andrija Zivkovic's delivery taking a vital touch off Karnicnik.\n\nLazar Samardzic stroked wide as Serbia desperately pushed for an equaliser, their prayers answered as Jovic turned in a corner with the final act of the match.", "source": {"uri": "e.vnexpress.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "VnExpress International \u2013

Neither nation won their opening game with Matjaz Kek's men holding Denmark to a 1-1 draw and Dragan Stojkovic's side narrowly going down 1-0 to England. With the Three Lions and the Danes now meeting, this is a golden chance for one of these two to steal a march on a potential second place finish with their fate in their hands for the third and final games.\n\nThis is Slovenia's first Euro since 2000 when they won admirers for their swashbuckling style of play which saw them garner two points from a possible nine and their only FIFA World Cup since then was back in 2010. Erik Janza's deflected effort saved a point for Kek and his players but Benjamin Sesko was inches away from scoring a spectacular winning goal which would have also secured a first-ever Euro win for Slovenia. These two shared a pulsating 3-3 draw back in 2000 when Serbia was still playing as Yugoslavia and this Slovenian outfit is unbeaten in seven international games across all competitions.\n\nThis is Serbia's first Euro as an independent nation and Stojkovic will be confident that his players can take care of Slovenia and pick up three points based on their improvement against England after going behind to Jude Bellingham's solitary goal. Factoring in former appearances as Yugoslavia as well as Serbia and Montenegro, Serbia have just one win from 12 Euro games. At least one win from these two remaining games and a minimum of four points will likely be needed to advance in second place so this will be considered a must-win game.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Slovenia and Serbia both have a big chance to pick up some vital points with England last for Kek's side and Denmark for Stojkovic's team. A win for Slovenia could have huge ramifications for not just Serbia but also the Danes while Serbia will fancy themselves to get at least a point against Denmark if they win this one.\n\nTeam news\n\nSlovenia: Kek is unlikely to change his starting XI with Janza continuing at left-back alongside Jaka Bijol, Vanja Drkusic and Zan Karnicnik in defense. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak is genuine quality between the sticks while Adam Gnezda Cerin and Timi Max Elsnik will anchor the midfield although 92-cap Jasmin Kurtic could push to be included. Petar Stojanovic and Jan Mlakar should provide the width again with star man Benjamin Sesko up top with Andraz Sporar and Zan Celar as well as Zan Vipotnik on the bench.\n\nPossible Slovenia XI: Oblak; Karnicnik, Blazic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Gnezda Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko.\n\nSerbia: Filip Kostic's Euro is over after a knee injury vs. England so Filip Mladenovic will come in. Sasa Lukic and Nemanja Gudelj should be the central midfield pairing unless Sergej Milinkovic-Savic goes deeper. If that is the case, Dusan Tadic could return behind Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic leading the line.\n\nPossible Serbia XI: V. Milinkovic-Savic; Veljkovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Zivkovic, S. Milinkovic-Savic, Gudelj, Mladenovic; Tadic; Vlahovic, Mitrovic.\n\nPrediction\n\nSlovenia's opener was a game of two halves while Serbia looked better after going behind but the goal threat of Benjamin Sesko is particularly hot right now. If Stojkovic's men are true to their Euro form, they could struggle again here which should favor Kek's side.

We are the tallest team at the EURO, and we need to be even more dangerous from set-pieces.\"\n\nSerbia scored 15 goals in qualifying for UEFA Euro 2024 with five of those coming from headers.\n\n\"They have some great individual players, a very compact team and they are really dangerous on the break so we, and especially in the defenders, need to be focused on that,\" said Milenkovic.\n\nSlovenia bounced back after conceding a 17th-minute goal to Denmark's Christian Eriksen to earn a 1-1 draw in their first game of the competition.\n\nErik Janza blasted home the equalizing marker, with the help of a deflection, to send Slovenia home with a point.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a tough match,\" said Janza after the draw. \"We had some problems in the first half but later we managed to pull together and get this draw. When the ball came to me, I just closed my eyes and kicked with all the power I've got. Soon another difficult match awaits us, but we have an open path.\"\n\nSlovenia is still looking for their first victory ever at the European Championship. They posted two draws and a loss at UEFA Euro 2020, their only other trip to the tournament.\n\n\"Many of my players have never played such a big competition,\" said Slovenia head coach Matjaz Kek. \"When we saw something was possible today, they started playing. I think we will learn from this. When this team plays their second or third big tournament, they will be much stronger from the outset.\"\n\nThe teams met twice during the 2022-23 UEFA Nations League, playing to a 2-2 draw in Slovenia and with Serbia earning a 4-1 victory on home soil.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\u201323_UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022\u201323 UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Group_C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Euro 2020 Group C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/6/19/erik-janza-1-2137079-1718835325051.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Serbia gave England a scare in their opening match. Slovenia is making just their second trip to the Euro tournament and has Denmark's number after finishing above them in their qualifying group. Serbia has fallen off over the past few years, failing to make the tournament in 2021 and finishing second to Hungary in qualifying. It is time to continue our Euro 2024 odds series with a Slovenia-Serbia prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nSlovenia's opening game started poorly when Christian Eriksen opened the scoring 17 minutes into the game. Slovenia held on for the remainder of the game, refusing to fall out of their structure until it paid off with a 77th-minute goal from Erik Janza. They are now in the driver's seat to guarantee advancement to the knockout stage if they can upset Serbia in this game.\n\nSerbia allowed an early 13th-minute header from Jude Bellingham, which looked to be the beginning of an onslaught on the weak Serbian backline. Serbia didn't back down, as they out-chanced England for the remainder of the game and nearly split the time of possession.\n\nSerbia relies on high chaos and events in their matchups to steal victories. The Serbians will sacrifice defensive play to increase their offensive output, but it doesn't always work out. They averaged just 1.51 expected goals/90 in qualifying. Benjamin Sesko could have a field day against Serbia, as the RB Leipzig striker has 11 goals in his last 13 matches before the tournament began. Serbia allows the second-most counterattacking shots/90, and their chaotic style could free up Sesko.\n\nWhy Serbia Will Win\n\nSerbia has a distinct advantage they can exploit against Slovenia when looking at the analytics from qualifying. Slovenia's defense struggled to defend balls coming into the box, allowing 5.35 accurate crosses/90, the second-highest mark in the field. Serbia didn't have much success offensively in qualifying, but one area they excelled was with crosses, as they had the second-most accurate crosses and third-best completion rate.\n\nSerbia is one of the weakest defensive teams in the tournament, as they get exposed by teams in transition. They allowed the second-most counterattacking shots/90 in qualifying. Slovenia has a good striker in Benjamin Sesko, but they don't have a great transition offense. Slovenia is more effective from set pieces against a weak qualifying group. The Serbians are more experienced and equipped to gameplan against the set pieces.\n\nFinal Slovenia-Serbia Prediction & Pick\n\nSerbia's performance against England gave no reason to believe they can't defeat Slovenia handily in this game. Serbia deserved to draw England at the very least and have a lot of edges over Slovenia. The biggest is their ability to generate offense from crosses. Slovenia's defense is one of the worst in the field at allowing accurate crosses into the box, while Serbia is one of the best at crossing. Serbia will struggle to score against teams who defend the air well like we saw when they couldn't find the equalizer against England, but that won't be the case here.\n\nClick here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_duffett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nate Duffett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_qualifying_Group_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_piece_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Set piece (football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Slovenia-vs.-Serbia-2024-Euros-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The game is scheduled to commence at 3 p.m.local time (1300 GMT).\n\nSlovenia is eager to secure their maiden group stage victory and progress to the knockout rounds for the first time in their history. Conversely, Serbia, participating independently in a European Championship for the first time, aims to emulate their past successes when competing as Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nInterestingly, the two teams faced each other at Euro 2000, where 10-man Yugoslavia staged a remarkable comeback from three goals down to draw 3-3 against Slovenia. Serbia's current coach, Dragan Stojkovi\u0107, was a substitute in that unforgettable match.\n\nBoth teams are reported to be free of injury concerns heading into the game. Historically, Slovenia and Serbia have been evenly matched, with six of their eight encounters resulting in draws, and each team claiming one victory.\n\nSlovenia comes into the match riding a seven-game unbeaten run, which includes a notable 2-0 victory over Portugal in a friendly international in March.\n\nSlovenia vs Serbia match details\n\nWhen will Slovenia vs Serbia start?\n\nThe UEFA European Championship 2024 Group A match between Slovenia vs Serbia is set for June 19, Wednesday.\n\nWhen and where to watch Slovenia vs Serbia in India?\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2024 match will take place at Cologne Stadium in Germany and is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 PM (Thursday) IST.

In a tournament of late drama there have been few moments quite as significant as the 96th minute strike that took the Serbs from the precipice of elimination -- they might have been knocked out even before their final group game -- to knowing that a win against Denmark in their final round of games would almost certainly be enough to reach the knockout rounds.\n\nThursday's later games see reruns of both of the Euro 2020 semifinals. Up first England will be bidding to put together an improved performance that ends with the same result as their Group C opener while Denmark are chasing their first win of the competition. Today's headline act might be the most exciting of the group stages as holders Italy face a Spanish side who hit a rich vein of form in their opening win over Croatia.\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Euro 2024 scores for Thursday\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovenia 1, Serbia 1England vs. Denmark, 12 p.m.Spain vs. Italy, 3 p.m.Slovenia 1, Serbia 1: Jovic saves Serbs at the last\n\nWith 95 and a half minutes played, Serbia were staring at what might have been the swiftest of eliminations from Euro 2024. Then, with the final touch of the game, Jovic saved them. The AC Milan striker was one of a string of forwards hurled on at the death as Dragan Stojkovic desperately tried to avoid a defeat to Slovenia that would have meant qualification hopes slipping out of the hands of Serbia, considered by many a dark horse to make a major impact on the tournament a week ago. They might still be able to even if they likely need to beat Denmark in their final game.\n\nJovic's late equaliser was harsh on Slovenia and in particular Zan Karnicnik, whose 69th minute goal seemed to have earned them a first win at the European Championships. The Celje right back's goal was the moment of outstanding individual quality in a game light on much in that regard, the move beginning with Karnicnik himself stealing possession before flying forward to apply the finishing touch to the counter, slotting Timi Max Elsnik's cross beyond a helpless Predrag Rajkovic.\n\nHaving hurtled up the pitch in pursuit of a crucial goal, Karnicnik might have been entitled to put up his feet for a moment or two. Happily for Slovenia he did not and moments later he was on hand to get the feintest of deflections onto Aleksandar Mitrovic's first time volley, taking the Al Hilal striker's effort against the crossbar. That was to be the best chance of many Mitrovic spurned in a match similar to their defeat to England, one where Serbia saw plenty of the ball but only translated that into overwhelming pressure on Jan Oblak's goal in the last seconds.\n\nThe Atletico Madrid shot stopper, so authoritative for the preceding 95 minutes, seemed blown backwards by the wave of Serbian bodies in his penalty area as Jovic rose to head Ivan Ilic's corner downwards, Oblak never getting near to laying a glove on the ball.\n\nGroup B outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nSpain\n\n0\n\n3\n\nItaly\n\n0\n\n3\n\nAlbania\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n4\n\nCroatia\n\n1\n\n-3\n\nA draw between Albania and Croatia yesterday ultimately suited neither side, even if the former were in jubilant mood after Klaus Gjasula's late equaliser. Whichever of Spain and Italy emerges victorious will qualify in first place, setting up a tie with one of the third place qualifiers from elsewhere. For the losers, even a point in their final match would likely be enough. A draw for the two past champions this evening and both would be exceedingly well placed to reach the last 16.\n\nGroup C outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nEngland\n\n0\n\nSlovenia\n\n0\n\nDenmark\n\n0\n\n4\n\nSerbia\n\n-1\n\nEngland can qualify as Group C winners with a win against Denmark, one which would be welcomed by Slovenia, particularly if it meant Gareth Southgate plays a weakened side for the final group game. Denmark would take top spot with a win while a draw would leave them with work still to do. Lose and their final group game with Serbia could be a cracker; win and either side would accrue the four point that has always been enough to reach the knockout stages since the championships expanded to 24 team in Euro 2016.\n\nWhat happened on Wednesday\n\nDay six of the tournament brought its first guaranteed qualifiers with Germany assuring themselves of their passage to the last 16 with a solid 2-0 win over Hungary. Switzerland haven't quite guaranteed a spot after their 1-1 draw with Scotland but it is highly unlikely that the four points they have already accrued won't be enough, whether they finish third or second. The Scots and Hungary could well be playing off for third in Stuttgart on Sunday. Meanwhile in Group B Croatia and Albania shared their first points of the tournament, a thrilling game where Gjasula went from the villain whose own goal had doomed his nation to defeat only for him to net in the 96th minute.\n\nFriday's fixtures\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovakia vs. Ukraine, 9 a.m. (preview)\n\nPoland vs. Austria, 12 p.m. (preview)\n\nNetherlands vs. France, 3 p.m. (preview)", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_benge@cbssports.com", "name": "James Benge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragan Stojkovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Slovenia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Serbia, bottom with one point, face Denmark next.

Oblak darted off his goalline to again thwart Mitrovic, who then headed narrowly over as Dragan Stojkovic's side upped the tempo.\n\nSesko eased the pressure on Slovenia with a curling effort that was superbly saved by Rajkovic, but Serbia continued to look the more threatening.\n\nMitrovic miscued another effort on goal before Serbia were stunned in the 68th minute.\n\nKarnicnik began a sweeping counter down the right and after spraying the ball wide he continued his run to guide home Elsnik's pinpoint cross at the far post.\n\nHaving opened the scoring, Karnicnik then got a vital foot on the ball to deflect Mitrovic's half-volley onto the crossbar as Serbia looked to respond.\n\nSubstitute Sergej Milinkovic-Savic headed wide, but as the clock ticked into the fifth minute of time added on, second half substitute Jovic headed an equaliser from Ivan Ilic's superb corner.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Goals Shared in Munich  | Goal.com US", "body": "Our soccer betting expert offers his Slovenia vs Serbia predictions and betting tips ahead of their Euros clash from the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nBoth teams will be hoping to get their first victory on the board at Euro 2024, with Slovenia bidding to build on their 1-1 draw with Denmark and Serbia out to avenge their narrow 1-0 loss to England.\n\nGiven the desperation for both to claim victory, this should be an entertaining watch and there is plenty of attacking quality on the pitch with Slovenia spearheaded by Leipzig livewire Benjamin Sesko and Serbia boasting the services of Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nWith a showdown against England to come, Slovenia's qualification hopes may rest on this fixture, while Serbia are looking to hit back following a 1-0 loss to the Three Lions in their Group C curtain-raiser.\n\nA goal could soon see this contest spark into life and, therefore, both teams to score looks to represent some value.\n\nThese two will have a decent understanding of one another, having met in the Nations League two years ago, and they were both lively affairs with Serbia winning 4-1 at home and the pair playing out a 2-2 draw in Slovenia.\n\nSlovenia's 1-1 draw with Denmark in their Group C opener means both teams have scored in six of their last eight matches while Serbia have managed only two clean sheets in their last 13 internationals.\n\nSerbia boast plenty of firepower with Mitrovic, who netted 28 goals in as many games in his debut season in Saudi Arabia, and Juventus' Vlahovic, while Slovenia have unearthed a potential striking star in Sesko.\n\nSesko has been grabbing plenty of attention from some of Europe's elite following his breakthrough at Leipzig, where he netted 18 goals in 42 appearances last season.\n\nThe 21-year-old has made a strong start to his international career, too, firing home 11 goals in his opening 30 caps and he looks a nice price to make his presence felt against Serbia.\n\nSesko was on target as a teenager when these two sides clashed in the Nations League two summers ago and, having hit the woodwork against Denmark, he may be able to silence the Serbs.", "source": {"uri": "goal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Goal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_evans@goal.com", "name": "Matthew Evans", "type": "author",

Slovenia have drawn their opening two matches and are also likely to need a win - against England - if they are to advance.\n\nSlovenia bossed the early stages, Adam Cerin firing a drive straight at Predrag Rajkovic with the Serbia goalkeeper also called on to repel a Jan Mlakar effort.\n\nIt took Serbia 26 minutes to conjure up anything going forward and, even then, Jan Oblak made a routine save from a Dusan Vlahovic header.\n\nSlovenia continued to look the more likely side to make the breakthrough and they were denied by the woodwork after 37 minutes. Elsnik capitalised on a one-two with a Serbia defender to weave his way through only to see his shot crash back off the right-hand post with Benjamin Sesko wastefully firing the rebound over the bar.\n\nKnowing a win would give their qualification hopes a major shot in the arm, Dragon Stojkovic's Serbia started the second period on the front foot with Mitrovic at the heart of the action.\n\nThe former Fulham striker saw a shot saved by Oblak before he headed over and then saw an another effort clear the bar.\n\nIn between, the hitherto quiet Sesko led a counter attack which culminated in the in-demand RB Leipzig striker curling a shot that required an acrobatic save from Rajkovic.\n\nIt appeared the game was heading towards the first goalless stalemate at Euro 2024 when Slovenia took the lead with Karnicnik starting and finishing the move.\n\nThe right-back led the charge, picking out Elsnik on the left-flank before continuing his run into the box and then stealing in at the far post to convert the cross ahead of substitute Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.\n\nKarnicnik then showed his prowess at the other end with a crucial block that diverted Mitrovic's shot onto the bar with Oblak beaten.\n\nThe Celje defender was enjoying his afternoon and he came close to adding another goal with a right-footed drive that flew past Rajkovic's right-hand post.\n\nSerbia poured forward in the latter stages but Oblak was not called into any meaningful action until he had two scoop the ball out of his net.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_fisher@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Jon Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Earlier in the week, the Football Association of Serbia had been charged by Uefa for inappropriate behaviour by their fans during the clash with England. They then threatened to pull out of the Euros and accused Croatia and Albania fans of hateful chanting. It was a lot of noise but not for the right reasons.\n\nOn the pitch, Serbia lost their opener to England, one of the tournament favourites, but the character they showed to not concede in the second half would have given them confidence. And before kickoff against Slovenia, a message from tennis legend Novak Djokovic, the most famous Serbian athlete, was played on the big screen inside the Allianz Arena in Munich to provide the final bit of motivation.\n\nAll of it resulted in an inspired performance by Serbia as they scored in the 95th minute to snatch a 1-1 draw with Slovenia. Luka Jovic's header into the bottom corner, which was the final play of the match, ensured the Eagles remained in contention for a round of 16 berth. Slovenia's players and fans were left with a look of disbelief. They gave it their all but it wasn't enough as their opponents simply refused to accept defeat.\n\nSlovenia, who themselves scored a late equaliser in their opening game against Denmark, began aggressively and dominated most of the first half. Jan Mlakar forced an early save from Predrag Rajkovic, before Timi Max Elsnik hit the post with a powerful shot.\n\nBut Serbia continued to endure the waves of attacks and finally created a chance of their own in the 42nd minute as Aleksandar Mitrovic managed to poke a shot on target.\n\nThe start of the second half, though, was a different story as Serbia created three chances within the first five minutes. Mitrovic was denied from close range again by Atletico Madrid 'keeper Jan Oblak. Jaka Bijol then nearly miscued a clearance into his own goal, before Mitrovic headed another chance just over.\n\nHowever, Slovenia didn't take too long to earn back the momentum. Benjamin Sesko hit a fine curling shot from distance but Rajkovic was up to the task and produced an equally impressive save.\n\nFinally, in the 69th minute, the deadlock was broken thanks to a stunning effort by Zan Karnicnik. The right-back picked up the ball from deep in his own half and cut in to make a powerful run down the field. He then found Elsnik on the left wing who played a well-weighted pass to the far corner where Karnicnik had reached to finish off the clinical move. Minutes later, Karnicnik produced another heroic effort to deflect Mitrovic's shot onto the post from inside the six-yard box.\n\nEven as Slovenia's fans rejoiced in the stands in the anticipation of a first-ever victory at the Euros, Serbia kept believing and hunting for an equaliser. And they finally found one in the most dramatic fashion as Jovic slotted home the ball from Ivan Ilic's corner to close out the match.

What Jude Bellingham must do to elevate his game\n\nIt feels like England can't spend more than three seconds ahead in a tournament match before someone starts shouting 'It's coming home!'.\n\nAs a nation without the tournament pedigree historically to necessarily justify consistently being regarded as favourites we do seem extremely quick to pull the trigger on that particular chant.\n\nHowever, whether it be poorly-aimed attempts at manifesting our destiny, mindless optimism or unconscious muscle memory, we are notoriously quick to sing our own praises.\n\nIn fact, the only thing England fans seem to do with greater zeal is, paradoxically, jump on the bandwagon of slamming our own team at the slightest hint of adversity.\n\nHowever, before we get to talk of football coming home, we have the important business of actually making it out the group first - so what needs to go England's way tonight for the Three Lions to join Germany in the second round? And is a draw enough?\n\nGareth Southgate's side are top of Group C with three ahead of their clash with Denmark\n\nJude Bellingham scored the only goal of the game as England beat Serbia 1-0 last Sunday\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: What Jude Bellingham must do to elevate his game LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring Play on Apple Spotify What if England win?\n\nEngland beat Serbia 1-0 as we know, Jude Bellingham thumping home the only goal of the game with his increasingly marketable head to give the Three Lions the perfect start.\n\nWhilst earlier that day, Denmark were held to a perhaps surprise 1-1 draw by Slovenia with Jan Oblak, Benjamin Sesko and Co impressing on their first tournament appearance in 14 years.\n\nToday Slovenia and Serbia played out a 1-1 draw, with AC Milan's Luka Jovic discovering the back of the net right at the death with 95th-minute equaliser.\n\nAs such that leaves the group looking like this:\n\nEngland 3pts (GD +1)Slovenia 2pts (GD 0)Denmark 1pt (GD 0) Serbia 0pts (GD -1).\n\nTherefore, as you'd imagine, a win puts England through regardless of results; their six points would be unassailable by more than one team, even if they did lose to Slovenia next week.\n\nSerbia could get a maximum of six points still, and so could Slovenia, but crucially they play one another today, meaning only one of them can actually do so. Likewise, Denmark would only be able to get three more if they lost today, taking them to four in total.\n\nSo a win is enough to qualify today, and it would also confirm their status as group winner.\n\nA win for England tonight puts England through to the last-16 top of Group C\n\nWhat if England draw?\n\nBut what if England draw, I hear you asking, pitchforks within reach. Well, it wouldn't actually be the end of the world.\n\nSeven points would be enough to take England through top of the group, as Denmark would only be able to muster a maximum total of five (one win, two draws), Serbia six (two wins, one defeat), while Slovenia could only get four if England beat them on Tuesday (one win, one draw, one defeat).\n\nSo if England draw with Denmark and beat Slovenia they're through top. But what if they draw tonight and lose to Slovenia? A draw certainly piles the pressure on heading into that last game.\n\nA draw tonight could leave the group looking like this:\n\nEngland would still remain top if today's game against Denmark ended as a tie. However they would need a draw or win in their final game to progress to the next stage.\n\nIf England loss to Serbia in their final group game, they would need Denmark to lose or draw against Serbia in their final game.\n\nEngland are considered the front-runners to go all the way in Germany despite not having won a tournament since 1966\n\nA draw against Denmark complicates matters, but England could still qualify top of the group\n\nWhat if England lose tonight?\n\nWell... again, although Southgate would likely begin to feel a little more heat than usual, England would still be able to go through top of the group if they can beat Slovenia.\n\nDefeat tonight would see Gareth Southgate's men fall to second in the group standings - a point behind Denmark - and one point above Slovenia.\n\nTherefore, a loss tonight, but a win over Slovenia on the final day, and England are still through on top with six points. Important to remember, even if things don't go to plan tonight.\n\nIt's a lot to get your heads around, but essentially: England win tonight, they're through. England win tonight and Slovenia fail to beat Serbia, and they're through as winners.\n\nA draw tonight is not the end of the world, but they would need to beat Slovenia to be sure of going through top, while two draws would need the Three Lions requiring results to go their way, and they could potentially find themselves in a three-way fight on five points with Slovenia and Denmark.\n\nSimilarly, defeat tonight is not the end of the world - though it may probably feel like it - and England can still top the group. Two losses make things somewhat more interesting, but let's not worry about that one too much just yet.\n\nIf Denmark and England draw\n\nEngland 4pts\n\nDenmark 3pts\n\nSlovenia 2pts\n\nSerbia 0pts\n\nAdvertisement If Denmark beat England\n\nDenmark 4pts\n\nEngland 3pts\n\nSlovenia 2pts\n\nSerbia 0pts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA win over Benjamin Sesko's Slovenia on Tuesday would see England go through top even if they lose to Denmark\n\nWho could England face in the Last-16?\n\nIn the spirit of getting ahead of ourselves, let's indulge in a bit of running before we can walk.\n\nShould all go to plan, England will win Group C, which draws them against the third-placed side in Groups D, E or F - at the time of writing those are Poland, Belgium and Czechia, though Austria, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Georgia are also likely contenders.\n\nCome second in the group, and that could tee up clashes with the winners of Group A, which for all intents and purposes would be Germany, who have six points, seven goals, and a whole heap of plaudits from two games. It wouldn't exactly be ideal.\n\nFinish third, and qualify as one of the four best third-placed sides, and England would take on the winners of either Group E or Group F - at the moment looking like Portugal or Belgium going of FIFA rankings, so maybe third place is a better option then second?", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Both teams seek to build on their opening performances: Slovenia securing a hard-fought draw against Denmark, and Serbia narrowly falling to England.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Matja\u017e Kek, Slovenia showcased resilience against Denmark, rallying late to salvage a point with Erik Janza's deflected strike.\n\nMeanwhile, Serbia, led by Dragan Stojkovi\u0107, demonstrated their mettle despite a narrow defeat to England. The tactical switch to a 5-3-2 formation in the second half highlighted their adaptability and offensive potential, spearheaded by Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107 and Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107.\n\nProbable Lineups for Slovenia vs Serbia\n\nThe probable lineup for Slovenia in the \"system of play.\"\n\nThe probable lineup for Serbia in the \"system of play.\"\n\nPlenty of goals in the Balkans derby\n\nThe clash promises intriguing battles across the pitch. Slovenia's defensive organisation, marshalled by veterans like Jaka Bijol and the ever-reliable Jan Oblak in goal, will be crucial in containing Serbia's dynamic attacking threats.\n\nOn the flip side, Serbia's robust midfield duo of Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107 and Nemanja Gudelj will aim to dictate the play and provide service to their potent strike force.\n\nThe matchup between Slovenia's rising star \u0160e\u0161ko and Serbia's defensive stalwarts, Milenkovi\u0107 and Pavlovi\u0107, will also be pivotal. \u0160e\u0161ko's ability to exploit spaces and create scoring opportunities could pose problems for Serbia's backline, while Mitrovi\u0107 and Vlahovi\u0107 will seek to capitalise on any defensive lapses from Slovenia.\n\nFollowing the initial game at Euro 2024, both coaches, Kek and Stojkovi\u0107, have emphasised the importance of tactical discipline and seizing key moments in their preparations. Reflecting on Slovenia's resilience against Denmark, Kek highlighted the team's growing confidence and unity, aiming to capitalise on set-pieces and counter-attacks against Serbia's aggressive style.\n\nOn the other hand, Stojkovi\u0107 stressed Serbia's need for clinical finishing and defensive solidity to secure their first win of the tournament. With key players like Dusan Tadic likely to feature prominently, Serbia will aim to convert their attacking prowess into a crucial win against their neighbours.\n\nSlovenia's compact defensive setup and Serbia's attacking firepower suggest a balanced encounter. However, Serbia's depth and experience at international level may give them a slight edge, particularly in exploiting set-piece opportunities and defensive transitions.\n\nWith qualification hopes hanging in the balance, expect a tense and fiercely competitive affair as both nations strive to take a significant step towards the knockout stages.\n\nSlovenia have returned to the Euros 24 years after their first appearance, but can't be underestimated. Buoyed by their solid defensive setup and the promising form of Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko upfront, they fully deserved the 1-1 draw against Denmark and aim to capitalise on their momentum.\n\nWith talents like Andra\u017e \u0160porar and Jan Oblak's commanding presence in goal, the Slovenians can certainly pose a challenge.\n\nGiven the attacking talent on display from both sides and their ambitions to secure a crucial victory, betting on goals seems reasonable. Slovenia will want to build on their resilience shown against Denmark, while Serbia will be eager to convert their chances into goals after a promising display in the second half against England.\n\nWith both teams likely to adopt an open approach, there could be opportunities for multiple goals at the Allianz Arena.", "source": {"uri": "goal.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Manager Dragan Stojkovic and his players are under pressure to deliver, so the quality attackers on the team should take center stage, as I explain in my Slovenia vs. Serbia prediction and Euro 2024 picks.\n\nSlovenia vs Serbia picks, predictions, and betting tips\n\nSlovenia had 11 attempts against Denmark, and they only scored once. But had Andra\u017e \u0160porar and Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko been more clinical in front of goal, the score could have been much different.\n\n\u0160e\u0161ko showed at national and club levels that he can be dangerous in front of any defense. He comes to Euro 2024 after netting 14 times in the Bundesliga last season for Leipzig. \u0160e\u0161ko is fresh from signing a new contract with the German club, but that shouldn't keep the Premier League spenders away for too long. Before he penned a new deal with Leipzig, \u0160e\u0161ko had been a target for both Arsenal and Chelsea.\n\nThe 20-year-old is one of the high-profile names expected to shine Halland-style at the top of European football in the years to come. He was ever-present in Slovenia's counters against Denmark. Manager Matja\u017e Kek hopes to see him deliver in front of a Serbian defense which has shown many liabilities over the past few years.\n\nSlovenia have only failed to score in one of their last 21 international games. Serbia have only kept two clean sheets in their previous 15 clashes at the Euros. None of these 15 matches finished goalless.\n\nWhen you think about Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107, Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107, Luka Jovi\u0107, Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107, and Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107, who are all expected to be involved in this matchup, you see plenty of creativity and goals on Serbia's behalf. Slovenia and Serbia have met eight times so far, with a victory each and six draws in their previous encounters. At Euro 2000, they were part of the same group, and their spectacular clash ended in a 3-3 draw.\n\nSlovenia and Serbia will both look to win and an open game is expected. A bet on both to score (-122 at Betano) is worth a proper look.\n\nSlovenia vs Serbia same-game parlay (SGP)\n\n\u0160e\u0161ko can profit from Serbia's defensive problems to capitalize in Slovenia's favor. Serbia conceded against weaker opposition throughout the qualifiers. Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Lithuania all found the net when playing the Serbs. Even teams ranked way below Serbia in the FIFA rankings like Jordan and Bahrain managed to penetrate their defense in friendlies. \u0160e\u0161ko, Slovenia's danger provider, will have the mission to hurt Serbia, so him shooting at least twice on goal looks like a good option.\n\nThe referee chosen to lead Slovenia vs. Serbia will be Romanian official Istvan Kovacs. Kovacs is renowned for having a limited tolerance when it comes to sanctioning players during games. In each of his previous eight matches in charge, he showed at least five yellow cards. Slovenia vs. Serbia is not expected to be a soft match, so Kovacs can surely see himself challenged by the occasion.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"},

Munich is the stage as Slovenia take on Serbia in the second round of group-stage games in Group C.\n\nSerbia were beaten 1-0 by England in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday night. Slovenia manager Dragan Stojkovic believes his side showed too much respect to England on Sunday.\n\n\"Against England we started playing with too much respect for them, like they came from another planet. It should not be like that. We played better against them later in the match and that's how we'll play against Slovenia.\"\n\nSlovenia fell behind to Denmark but equalised through Erik Janza with just over ten minutes to go to take a point from their opening game. With four of the third-placed teams going through into the knockout stages, every point is vital and the door is open. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, who has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs, will lead the line for Slovenia, with Atletico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak another key figure for them.\n\nSlovenia are looking to build on the point against Denmark and manager Matjaz Kek is hoping his side can show what they are made of against Serbia this afternoon.\n\n\"This team will grow from minute to minute in these surroundings. It's too optimistic to expect too much from this team, bigger teams have failed. We all want to achieve a positive result and we want to prove tomorrow that we deserve to be here, that we qualified for Germany on merit.\"\n\nSix of the previous eight matches between Slovenia and Serbia in all competitions have ended in a draw, with each side winning once apiece in the other two matches. The two sides last met in the Uefa Nations League, in June 2022, with Serbia winning 4-1 in Belgrade before a 2-2 draw in Ljubljana a week later.\n\nTeam news to follow shortly.", "source": {"uri":

Munich on Thursday afternoon, as Slovenia take on Serbia.\n\nBoth nations, who failed to win their opening group matches, are separated by just one point in the current standings and know that victory here would significantly boost their chances of reaching the knockout rounds.\n\nWe say: Slovenia 1-1 Serbia\n\nSix of the last eight meetings between these two nations have ended as draw, and although both teams will be pushing for a victory on Thursday, a closely-fought contest could be on the cards in Munich.\n\nBoth nations possess star strikers that have the capabilities to cause problems on their day, but whether their threat is enough to power their side to three crucial points remains to be seen.\n\n> Click here to read our full preview for this match\n\n> How Serbia could

attacking players at their disposal to cause England one or two problems, but if the Three Lions can defend with the same resilience that got them over the line versus Serbia and Southgate gets his final-third stars to click, then they should find a way to claim another narrow victory and secure their place in the last 16.\n\n> Click here to read our full preview for this match\n\n> How England

Morten Hjulmand's fine low drive earned the Danes a point but they could have got more from an opponent who seemed insistent on handing them possession with the sloppiest play this side has delivered in several tournaments.\n\nEarlier in the day Luka Jovic's last gasp header earned Serbia a priceless point in the same group, their 1-1 draw with Slovenia keeping hopes alive heading into the final round of fixtures. In a tournament of late drama there have been few moments quite as significant as the 96th minute strike that took the Serbs from the precipice of elimination -- they might have been knocked out even before their final group game -- to knowing that a win against Denmark in their final round of games would almost certainly be enough to reach the knockout rounds.\n\nToday's headline act might be the most exciting of the group stages as holders Italy face a Spanish side who hit a rich vein of form in their opening win over Croatia.\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Euro 2024 scores for Thursday\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovenia 1, Serbia 1England 1, Denmark 1Spain vs. Italy, 3 p.m.England 1, Denmark 1: Stale draw keeps Three Lions top\n\nIf you didn't see this game, don't worry, if you've watched much of England at a major tournament during Gareth Southgate's tenure, you've already seen it. A bright start, a nicely constructed early goal and an insistence that what they have they hold. This time the Three Lions clean sheet was sullied, a point that keeps them top of Group C likely to do little to quell the grumbles over how this galaxy of stars has been arranged.\n\nAs had been the case against Serbia, nothing quite clicked for anywhere near as long as England might like it to. In the one instance where a few players were on the same wavelength, they scored. Kyle Walker showed a burst belying his 34 years to beat Viktor Kristiansen to a through ball in behind, his low cross deflecting twice to land into the path of Kane for a bundled finish.\n\nThe pitch in Frankfurt was hardly conducive to free-flowing football but the game was there for England to control. Instead they did just what they had done against Serbia, dropping deep to defend their own penalty area for the next 72 minutes. They do that as well as any international side, it's just not a particularly shrewd tactic when you are one shot away from a problem. That came when possession was conceded sloppily from a throw in, Denmark moving the ball to Hjulmand, whose low strike snapped off Jordan Pickford's near post and in.\n\nEngland never roused themselves from that setback. Indeed their trajectory from then on was largely downwards. Southgate changed what he could, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka all sacrificed to bring greater depth to proceedings. Bar a brief flurry from Ollie Watksin and Conor Gallagher, England got steadily worse, sloppy errors at the back handing late half openings to the Danes. Group C may still be theirs to win but there is work to do for England to convince a skeptical public back home that they are on a tournament-winning trajectory.\n\nSlovenia 1, Serbia 1: Jovic saves Serbs at the last\n\nWith 95 and a half minutes played, Serbia were staring at what might have been the swiftest of eliminations from Euro 2024. Then, with the final touch of the game, Jovic saved them. The AC Milan striker was one of a string of forwards hurled on at the death as Dragan Stojkovic desperately tried to avoid a defeat to Slovenia that would have meant qualification hopes slipping out of the hands of Serbia, considered by many a dark horse to make a major impact on the tournament a week ago. They might still be able to even if they likely need to beat Denmark in their final game.\n\nJovic's late equaliser was harsh on Slovenia and in particular Zan Karnicnik, whose 69th minute goal seemed to have earned them a first win at the European Championships. The Celje right back's goal was the moment of outstanding individual quality in a game light on much in that regard, the move beginning with Karnicnik himself stealing possession before flying forward to apply the finishing touch to the counter, slotting Timi Max Elsnik's cross beyond a helpless Predrag Rajkovic.\n\nHaving hurtled up the pitch in pursuit of a crucial goal, Karnicnik might have been entitled to put up his feet for a moment or two. Happily for Slovenia he did not and moments later he was on hand to get the feintest of deflections onto Aleksandar Mitrovic's first time volley, taking the Al Hilal striker's effort against the crossbar. That was to be the best chance of many Mitrovic spurned in a match similar to their defeat to England, one where Serbia saw plenty of the ball but only translated that into overwhelming pressure on Jan Oblak's goal in the last seconds.\n\nThe Atletico Madrid shot stopper, so authoritative for the preceding 95 minutes, seemed blown backwards by the wave of Serbian bodies in his penalty area as Jovic rose to head Ivan Ilic's corner downwards, Oblak never getting near to laying a glove on the ball.\n\nGroup B outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nSpain\n\n0\n\n3\n\nItaly\n\n0\n\n3\n\nAlbania\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n4\n\nCroatia\n\n1\n\n-3\n\nA draw between Albania and Croatia yesterday ultimately suited neither side, even if the former were in jubilant mood after Klaus Gjasula's late equaliser. Whichever of Spain and Italy emerges victorious will qualify in first place, setting up a tie with one of the third place qualifiers from elsewhere. For the losers, even a point in their final match would likely be enough. A draw for the two past champions this evening and both would be exceedingly well placed to reach the last 16.\n\nGroup C outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nEngland\n\n1\n\n4\n\nSlovenia\n\n0\n\nDenmark\n\n0\n\n4\n\nSerbia\n\n-1\n\nA win for England over Slovenia would guarantee top spot for Southgate's side, who cannot finish lower than third in Group C and are therefore likely to have already qualified. If Denmark beat Serbia they will also qualify while their opponents must win to reach the knockout stages.\n\nWhat happened on Wednesday\n\nDay six of the tournament brought its first guaranteed qualifiers with Germany assuring themselves of their passage to the last 16 with a solid 2-0 win over Hungary. Switzerland haven't quite guaranteed a spot after their 1-1 draw with Scotland but it is highly unlikely that the four points they have already accrued won't be enough, whether they finish third or second. The Scots and Hungary could well be playing off for third in Stuttgart on Sunday. Meanwhile in Group B Croatia and Albania shared their first points of the tournament, a thrilling game where Gjasula went from the villain whose own goal had doomed his nation to defeat only for him to net in the 96th minute.\n\nFriday's fixtures\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovakia vs. Ukraine, 9 a.m. (preview)\n\nPoland vs. Austria, 12 p.m. (preview)\n\nNetherlands vs. France, 3 p.m. (preview)",

Meanwhile, England had somewhat of a disappointing victory against Serbia. It is time to continue our Euro 2024 odds series with a Denmark-England prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nChristian Eriksen scored the opening goal for Denmark 17 minutes into their game against Slovenia. Denmark looked good in the first half, but Slovenia took control in the second and equalized the match. Denmark could be in trouble with upcoming games against England and Serbia, as a singular draw won't get them into the knockout stage field.\n\nEngland will not be happy about their tournament opening game against Serbia. They expected to roll over this group on the way to the knockout stage, but Serbia gave them everything they could handle in a 1-0 victory. The good news for England is that Serbia should be their toughest test.\n\nThere are a lot of questions surrounding England after their opening match. Most pundits expected them to dominate Serbia, but the opposite occurred. The game was pretty even in possession, and Serbia out-chanced England 6-5. Serbia plays a high-event strategy, which seemed to confuse England and may be the only question about Denmark's chances in this game.\n\nIt's hard to see Denmark playing that style well enough against England to stay in the game. They'll need to play their game and hope England makes one or two mistakes to steal a victory.\n\nWhy England Will Win\n\nDenmark is a better team when their opponents are playing passively and they can play with a lot more possession. Just because they play better, doesn't mean it's a perfect formula, as Denmark controlled their tournament opener but still only managed to get a 1-1 draw. It would always be much harder for Denmark against teams like England and Serbia.\n\nSet pieces are one of Denmark's biggest strengths, as they get the second-most shots off set pieces in the field. However, England is the best defensive team in the tournament and allowed the fewest shots per set piece in qualifying.\n\nOne of Denmark's strengths is pressing to kickstart a counterattack when they lose the ball. England also has an answer for them in this area, as they allowed the sixth-fewest shots off counterattacks.\n\nFinal Denmark-England Prediction & Pick\n\nEngland can contend with most of Denmark's strengths. Denmark can be successful with teams playing passively since they can exploit them on the counterattack. When teams like England take the field with them, they can't generate scoring chances nearly as much.\n\nThe issue for Denmark is they barely have any success against the passive teams. They are long removed from their trip to the semifinals of Euro 2021, as they only tied Slovenia in the opening game and lost to teams like Kazakhstan and Northern Ireland.\n\nDenmark gets too much credit for past successes. England can't be happy with their performance against Serbia, and this could be a game where they run away with the victory to prove a point. The narrative around England will be that they are losing form in a significant tournament again, and it'll be up to them to prove everyone wrong.\n\nClick here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_duffett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nate Duffett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Denmark-vs.-England-2024-Euros-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

We've had a lot of players that hadn't played 90 minutes for a long time.\n\n\"We expended a lot of energy in that first half. I knew that we would dip. And it was a good moment to bring Conor [Gallagher] into the game, who can get up to the ball and provide that bit more defensive solidity at that time.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot of new players, young players, so the team that started was a very experienced team in terms of international and club bar Marc, really, who had a brilliant game.\n\n\"So we're just going to have to assess as we go from game to game.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_penn@thesun.ie", "name": "Matt Penn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dylan_terry@thesun.ie", "name": "Dylan Terry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Wind", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Jensen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathias Jensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/RB-GROUP-C-denmarkvengland-team-preview_OP_cb4e4a.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

For many the match was over but for us it was not,\u201d Stojkovic told reporters.\n\n\u201cOur stats are much better, from chances created to shots on target. But goals are the ones that count. It is important that we secured that draw, even though the starting line-up shows that our idea was to win and to score goals \u2013 to play attractive, attacking football.\u201d\n\nClear favourites heading into the game, Serbia refused to accept a shock loss to Slovenia. While not the win he had wanted, Stojkovic declared himself satisfied.\n\n\u201cThe number of opportunities we created \u2013 ball possessions, shots on goal \u2013 we want an offensive game, we want to create opportunities.

I\u2019m not quite sure how [Aleksandar] Mitrovic\u2019s chances didn\u2019t turn into a goal,\u201d the coach said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 like boring football. I want to see my team attack, create chances, I want to see Serbia with full determination. Can we score? I think yes. But sometimes you have to be lucky also. I am very satisfied with the performance, because to create seven, eight or nine occasions with big chances to score \u2013 this is something that is very important.\u201d\n\nSerbia captain Dusan Tadic was less upbeat.\n\n\u201c[I have] mixed feelings. We wanted three points. Slovenia had more initiative. We have missed too many [chances] for our standards,\u201d he told Serbian television.\n\nStojkovic is expecting an open game against the Danes.\n\n\u201cWe know how they play,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also drew 1-1 with the Slovenians, they are not invincible, but they are strong and of good quality.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the head of the Serbian football association threatened to pull the team out of the Euro 2024 over chants made during Wednesday\u2019s draw between Albania and Croatia.\n\nJovan Surbatovic \u2013 the General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) \u2013 told Serbian broadcaster RTS the country demanded action from authorities over remarks made during the match, including the chant: \u201cKill, kill, kill the Serb.\u201d\n\nSurbatovic told RTS the FSS would seek sanctions from Uefa \u201ceven at the cost of not continuing the competition\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic said the issue was \u201cnot important\u201d after his side\u2019s 1-1 draw with Slovenia to stay in contention for the next round.\n\n\u201cPlease ask me about the game. For me this is not important, I\u2019m just focusing on the game,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t read anything. Believe me or not, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nSerbia has had tense relations with both Albania and Croatia in past decades.\n\nIn the 1990s, a string of wars broke out across the former Yugoslavia that saw bloody fighting in Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia.\n\nMany blamed late Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for instigating the conflicts.\n\nSerbia also fought a war against ethnic Albanian insurgents in the breakaway province of Kosovo in the late 1990s, which triggered a Nato intervention in the conflict.\n\nSerbia are competing in their first European Championship since the

This is Serbia's first European Championship as an independent nation, although the team has advanced out of the group stage under previous iterations as Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nHistorically, there's been little to separate these teams: six of their eight previous encounters have ended in a draw, with one win apiece. Slovenia is on a seven-match unbeaten streak, including a surprising 2-0 victory over Portugal in March. Neither team reported any injury concerns ahead of this closely watched showdown, where key players from both sides aim to set the tone early in the match.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UTC+2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia and Montenegro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_09_14_29_047616.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Morten Hjulmand's fine low drive earned the Danes a point but they could have got more from an opponent who seemed insistent on handing them possession with the sloppiest play this side has delivered in several tournaments.\n\nEarlier in the day Luka Jovic's last gasp header earned Serbia a priceless point in the same group, their 1-1 draw with Slovenia keeping hopes alive heading into the final round of fixtures. In a tournament of late drama there have been few moments quite as significant as the 96th minute strike that took the Serbs from the precipice of elimination -- they might have been knocked out even before their final group game -- to knowing that a win against Denmark in their final round of games would almost certainly be enough to reach the knockout rounds.\n\nIn the day's late game, Spain topped Italy 1-0 on an own goal to clinch a spot in the round of 16.\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Euro 2024 scores for Thursday\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovenia 1, Serbia 1England 1, Denmark 1Spain 1, Italy 0Spain 1, Italy 0: Own goal strikes again\n\nThe most anticipated group stage match of the competition was decided on an own goal, with Riccardo Calafiori's mistake in the 55th minute offering Spain the 1-0 edge over Italy.\n\nThe victors were dominant from start to finish, holding on to nearly 60% of the ball and taking 20 shots while limiting Italy to just four. May wondered how long Italy would be able to resist Spain's pressure, and though Gianluigi Donnarumma made eight changes, things took a turn for the worse pretty quickly in the second half. Nico Williams' cross led Alvaro Morata to flick the ball slightly with his head and as it landed towards the far post, a running Calafiori accidentally directed it into his own net.\n\nWhile Spain are through to the next round with a game to spare, it is not all good news -- Rodri picked up his second yellow card of the competition, meaning he will miss their Group B finale against Albania on Monday.\n\nEngland 1, Denmark 1: Stale draw keeps Three Lions top\n\nIf you didn't see this game, don't worry, if you've watched much of England at a major tournament during Gareth Southgate's tenure, you've already seen it. A bright start, a nicely constructed early goal and an insistence that what they have they hold. This time the Three Lions clean sheet was sullied, a point that keeps them top of Group C likely to do little to quell the grumbles over how this galaxy of stars has been arranged.\n\nAs had been the case against Serbia, nothing quite clicked for anywhere near as long as England might like it to. In the one instance where a few players were on the same wavelength, they scored. Kyle Walker showed a burst belying his 34 years to beat Viktor Kristiansen to a through ball in behind, his low cross deflecting twice to land into the path of Kane for a bundled finish.\n\nThe pitch in Frankfurt was hardly conducive to free-flowing football but the game was there for England to control. Instead they did just what they had done against Serbia, dropping deep to defend their own penalty area for the next 72 minutes. They do that as well as any international side, it's just not a particularly shrewd tactic when you are one shot away from a problem. That came when possession was conceded sloppily from a throw in, Denmark moving the ball to Hjulmand, whose low strike snapped off Jordan Pickford's near post and in.\n\nEngland never roused themselves from that setback. Indeed their trajectory from then on was largely downwards. Southgate changed what he could, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka all sacrificed to bring greater depth to proceedings. Bar a brief flurry from Ollie Watksin and Conor Gallagher, England got steadily worse, sloppy errors at the back handing late half openings to the Danes. Group C may still be theirs to win but there is work to do for England to convince a skeptical public back home that they are on a tournament-winning trajectory.\n\nSlovenia 1, Serbia 1: Jovic saves Serbs at the last\n\nWith 95 and a half minutes played, Serbia were staring at what might have been the swiftest of eliminations from Euro 2024. Then, with the final touch of the game, Jovic saved them. The AC Milan striker was one of a string of forwards hurled on at the death as Dragan Stojkovic desperately tried to avoid a defeat to Slovenia that would have meant qualification hopes slipping out of the hands of Serbia, considered by many a dark horse to make a major impact on the tournament a week ago. They might still be able to even if they likely need to beat Denmark in their final game.\n\nJovic's late equaliser was harsh on Slovenia and in particular Zan Karnicnik, whose 69th minute goal seemed to have earned them a first win at the European Championships. The Celje right back's goal was the moment of outstanding individual quality in a game light on much in that regard, the move beginning with Karnicnik himself stealing possession before flying forward to apply the finishing touch to the counter, slotting Timi Max Elsnik's cross beyond a helpless Predrag Rajkovic.\n\nHaving hurtled up the pitch in pursuit of a crucial goal, Karnicnik might have been entitled to put up his feet for a moment or two. Happily for Slovenia he did not and moments later he was on hand to get the feintest of deflections onto Aleksandar Mitrovic's first time volley, taking the Al Hilal striker's effort against the crossbar. That was to be the best chance of many Mitrovic spurned in a match similar to their defeat to England, one where Serbia saw plenty of the ball but only translated that into overwhelming pressure on Jan Oblak's goal in the last seconds.\n\nThe Atletico Madrid shot stopper, so authoritative for the preceding 95 minutes, seemed blown backwards by the wave of Serbian bodies in his penalty area as Jovic rose to head Ivan Ilic's corner downwards, Oblak never getting near to laying a glove on the ball.\n\nGroup B outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nSpain\n\n0\n\n4\n\nItaly\n\n1\n\n3\n\nAlbania\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n4\n\nCroatia\n\n1\n\n-3\n\nGroup C outlookRankTeamWDLGDPts.\n\nEngland\n\n1\n\n4\n\nSlovenia\n\n0\n\nDenmark\n\n0\n\n4\n\nSerbia\n\n-1\n\nWhat happened on Wednesday\n\nDay six of the tournament brought its first guaranteed qualifiers with Germany assuring themselves of their passage to the last 16 with a solid 2-0 win over Hungary. Switzerland haven't quite guaranteed a spot after their 1-1 draw with Scotland but it is highly unlikely that the four points they have already accrued won't be enough, whether they finish third or second. The Scots and Hungary could well be playing off for third in Stuttgart on Sunday. Meanwhile in Group B Croatia and Albania shared their first points of the tournament, a thrilling game where Gjasula went from the villain whose own goal had doomed his nation to defeat only for him to net in the 96th minute.\n\nFriday's fixtures\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovakia vs. Ukraine, 9 a.m. (preview)\n\nPoland vs. Austria, 12 p.m. (preview)\n\nNetherlands vs. France, 3 p.m. (preview)",

Sesko and Vlahovic scored a combined 30 goals in their respective domestic leagues last season and each committed 1+ fouls in their opening group stage game.\n\nMeanwhile, the price boosts are for Dusan Tadic to score or assist at 1/1, for there to be 10+ match shots on target at 2/1, and Sesko to have 2+ shots on target at 5/1.\n\nTadic had four goal involvements in Serbia's last four Euro 2024 qualification games, while Sesko had two shots on target in his last outing for RB Leipzig.\n\nLastly, the scorecast boost - which is valued at an eye-catching 33/1 - needs Aleksandar Mitrovic to score first and Serbia to win 2-1.\n\nSky Bet odds for Slovenia vs Serbia:\n\nSerbia 7/10\n\nSlovenia 15/4\n\nDraw 13/5\n\nSky Bet Featured RequestABet for Slovenia vs Serbia:\n\nBenjamin Sesko and Dusan Vlahovic to both score and commit 1+ fouls each\n\n16/1\n\nSky Bet Price Boosts for Slovenia vs Serbia:\n\nDusan Tadic to score or assist WAS 4/5 NOW 1/1\n\n10+ match shots on target WAS 5/4 NOW 2/1\n\nBenjamin Sesko to have 2+ shots on target WAS 3/1 NOW 5/1\n\nSky Bet Scorecast Boost for Slovenia vs Serbia:\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic to score first and Serbia to win 2-1\n\n33/1\n\nAll odds are correct at the time of publication", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du\u0161an_Tadi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/08/86355663-0-image-m-17_1718869620207.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

We were so close. We played very well but just couldn't manage to hold them off,\" Karnicnik said.\n\n\"They scored after many long balls, which they are very good at.

Two of the three matches feature perennially strong national teams facing off against one another and plenty of intrigue and storylines to go along with the rivalries.\n\nSlovenia and Serbia have the early match after both teams had admirable performances in their openers. Then, England takes on Denmark after the Three Lions had an unconvincing win in the opening match. If England doesn't have a better performance against Denmark, the result likely won't be the same.\n\nThe final match of the day is the clear showcase match: Spain vs. Italy. That's a meeting of two world powers that have seen plenty of one another in recent European Championships.\n\nWe're looking at what the odds predict for each match and what we're anticipating from each team.\n\nSerbia can take pride away from its defeat to England, but not points. The Serbians may have confidence they can outplay Slovenia after doing so for most of the second half against England, but the pressure is on to get a win.\n\nSlovenia was able to get a draw against Denmark, a positive result that gives the group longshots a real chance to advance. Slovenia has never made it out of the group stage of a major tournament.\n\nSerbia is favored in this match. A win would be just Serbia's fourth victory in a major tournament in the 21st century.\n\nWinning with style isn't as important as simply winning when it comes to major tournaments, but more is expected of this England team than what it showed against Serbia. The Three Lions were in control early and went ahead via Jude Bellingham, but the second half will not be one to remember. England managed just five shots against Serbia and was outshot 6-5 in that 1-0 victory.\n\nHow will this team respond? Denmark, on paper, is a tougher opponent. If England doesn't win, the concern among the English will be palpable. That said, a controlled win will quell any fears and even a draw would secure a spot in the knockout stage.\n\nThe odds actually shifted a bit with England's showing as well. The Three Lions were the tournament favorite, but they are now co-favorite with France.\n\nThis is a rematch of a semifinal from the last European Championship, which Italy won on penalties. These teams also met in the Round of 16 in 2016 (Italy won 2-0), in the final in 2012 (Spain won 4-0) and in a quarterfinal in 2008 (Spain won in penalties). This year, they meet in the group stage after both teams won their opening matches.\n\nSpain had less possession than Croatia but was clinical in its finishing in a 3-0 win. That scoreline was one of the most impressive results for a team in the first set of group matches.\n\nItaly's score was far from impressive, going down 1-0 to Albania 23 seconds into the match before winning 2-1, but it was impressive how the Azzurri responded to that early deficit. The Italians led before the match was 20 minutes old and didn't allow another shot on target the rest of the match. The Azzurri completed 93 percent of their passes, which will make for a fascinating matchup against a Spanish team that got out-possessed against Croatia.\n\nSpain opened with an edge in the odds but is not a big favorite to win this match.\n\nWhy 'provocative' flags - including Russia's - at Euro 2024 could see nations face sanctions\n\nEngland starting XI to face Denmark: Foden?

We knew Serbia were dangerous from set pieces. We perhaps lapsed in concentration, but I am nevertheless proud of the players for their incredible heart.\n\n\"We played a brave and honest game against a magnificent backdrop, which will go into the legend of Slovenian sport.\"\n\nHe turned his attentions to Tuesday night's clash with England in Cologne and said: \"We are now facing the last group game. We turn our thought toward England.\n\n\"They are clear favourites, but so were the Danes and the Serbs. So we need to lift our heads and prepare for England.\"", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoad@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Alex Hoad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Mitrovi\u0107_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Mitrovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_1884263662-768x403.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

This game likely represents the best chance for both sides to pick up a win in Group C. Ahead of the Slovenia vs Serbia game let us take a look at the Prediction for the game of underdogs.\n\nAccording to Opta supercomputer Serbia have a 49.2% chance of winning this match against Slovenia, who have a 24.3% chance. Given Serbia's squad and recent form, they are favoured to win. Our prediction is a 2-1 victory for Serbia over Slovenia.\n\nSlovenia, sit in third place in the group and has shown impressive form in the competition so far. They held Denmark to a 1-1 draw last week. Slovenia's pre-tournament form was solid, remaining unbeaten in seven games. Although they had to dig deep to maintain this run against Denmark, they managed to create two big chances despite only having 32% possession.\n\nSlovenia also displayed a good attacking record recently. They have scored an average of 1.6 goals per game in their last 10 matches, including friendlies while conceding an average of 0.8 goals. This defensive solidity could pose a challenge for Serbia, who must take risks to secure a win.\n\nSerbia find themselves at the bottom of Group C in the UEFA Euro 2024 standings . They suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat against England in their previous game, despite some resilient efforts. Serbia's performance against England was a little stale. The match had a combined expected goals (xG) of just 0.7, and only 11 shots were taken.\n\nDuring their qualifying campaign, Serbia scored an average of 1.88 goals per game and finished four points behind Hungary. However, they conceded an average of 1.12 goals in the same period and have managed only two clean sheets in their last 10 matches.\n\nOblak; Karnicnik, Drkusicm Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Cerin,

So it couldn't be any bigger,\" said Southgate of his team's objective at the competition.\n\n\"Clearly we are disappointed with the level of the two performances,\" he added after a result which followed their opening 1-0 win against Serbia.\n\n- Jovic saves Serbia -\n\nThe day's other match in Group C also ended in a 1-1 draw, as Luka Jovic snatched a point for Serbia in the 95th minute to hold Slovenia.\n\nZan Karnicnik had headed Slovenia in front 21 minutes from time in Munich.\n\nBut Serbia kept their fate of reaching the last 16 in their own hands when AC Milan striker Jovic headed in a corner with virtually the last action of the game.\n\nEngland top the group on four points, two clear of Denmark and Slovenia, and just need a draw when they face Slovenia in Cologne to be sure of qualifying.\n\nOn Friday, France take on the Netherlands in Leipzig in one of the other marquee games of the group stage.\n\nKylian Mbappe's participation in the Group D match remains uncertain after the France captain broke his nose in Les Bleus' opening 1-0 win over Austria.\n\nHowever, Didier Deschamps is hopeful of having Real Madrid's new signing available after Mbappe trained in a mask inspired by the colours of the French flag on Thursday.\n\n\"Things are progressing in the right direction enough for us to try to have him available,\" said Deschamps.\n\nPoland and Austria meet before that game in the same group in Berlin, while Friday's first match sees Slovakia play Ukraine in Group E in Duesseldorf.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nEngland's Euro 2024 opener against Serbia was a game of two very different halves.\n\nThe Three Lions dominated the first 45 minutes, taking the lead through Jude Bellingham and looking in full control right up until the referee called time on the opening period.\n\nThe objective in the second half would have been to keep Serbia at arm's length and extend their lead. That might even have allowed them to rest some of their main men in the closing stages.\n\nInstead, Serbia came out for the second half with renewed vigour and England struggled to match it. The pre-tournament favourites sank ever deeper and ceded possession ever more easily.\n\nSerbia created a few openings and, on another night, they could easily have scored from one of them. This did not look like a recipe for future success from Gareth Southgate's side, with the manager once again coming under fire after the final whistle.\n\nOf course, the most important thing was that England picked up all three points on matchday one. That 1-0 defeat of Serbia takes the pressure off ahead of this tussle with Denmark.\n\nBut there is no doubt that England fans will be looking to see more from their team in this match, which pits them against stronger opposition in Denmark.\n\nWe could see some tinkering from Southgate, who is likely to bring an end to the experiment of playing Trent Alexander-Arnold alongside Declan Rice in midfield. One of Connor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo or Adam Wharton will probably get the nod here.\n\nFurther forward England must get Harry Kane more involved in the game after a quiet night against Serbia. And they will also be looking for a bigger contribution from Phil Foden, who has flattered to deceive for much of his senior international career to date.\n\nEngland's performance in their first game was a wake-up call. Yet while it always felt a little odd that they were the outright favourites to win the trophy this summer, it is important to avoid overreacting to a sub-par showing against Serbia. England still have time to get things right.\n\nEngland will be looking to make it six points from six when they take on Denmark in Group C.\n\nDenmark will still be kicking themselves that they did not take all three points from their first game against Slovenia.\n\nChristian Eriksen gave his side the lead early on and Denmark dominated possession for most of the encounter. But they ultimately let the game drift and their failure to extend their one-goal advantage allowed Slovenia to get back into it in the second half.\n\nA 1-1 draw means Kasper Hjulmand's side have plenty of work to do. In short, they must beat one of England or Serbia to stand a realistic chance of advancing to the round of 16.\n\nDenmark pushed Southgate's side all the way in the semi-finals of Euro 2020, but they have gone backwards since then.\n\nThat is not to say they are incapable of causing England problems, and John Stones and Marc Guehi will be tested by a front two of Rasmus Hojlund and Jonas Wind. Even so, England should prove too strong.\n\n\u26bd Tip England to win at 4/6 with Betfred \u26bd\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Denmark stick with the same attack-minded formation they chose against Slovenia. Eriksen was deployed as a No.10 on matchday one behind Wind and Hojlund up top.\n\nEven if they drop Wind for another midfielder, Denmark will not be afraid of committing bodies to attack against England. There are question marks over the latter's defence and Hojlund has long encouraged his side to be proactive where possible.\n\nEqually, England will be conscious of the fact they were poor in the second half against Serbia.\n\nEven if they are in the lead on Thursday, we should see Southgate's side make more of an effort to avoid dropping too deep and allowing their opponents back into the game.\n\nAll in all, this promises to be an entertaining encounter in Group C.\n\n\u26bd Go for over 2.5 goals at 6/5 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nBellingham was England's standout performer by some distance against Serbia.\n\nHe took the game by the scruff of its neck in the first half in particular, scoring a fine header and always showing for the ball.\n\nBellingham thrived as a goalscoring attacking midfielder for Real Madrid in 2023/24 and Southgate has given him the same role at the European Championship.\n\nHe timed his run perfectly for the winning goal last time out, crashing into the box at precisely the right moment.\n\nBellingham showed in his debut season at Madrid that he can score different types of goals and he will be a threat in every match he plays at this tournament.\n\n\u26bd Back Jude Bellingham to score any time at 13/5 with talkSPORT BET \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

Zan Karnicnik's goal appeared to have sealed Slovenia's first-ever European Championship victory, only for Luka Jovic's stoppage-time header to rescue a vital point for Dragan Stojkovic's resilient Serbian side. The match, held in front of a packed Allianz Arena, was filled with tense moments and missed opportunities on both ends, underscoring the intensity and unpredictability of elite international football.\n\nThe Euro 2024 encounter started with high intensity as both sides exchanged early chances. Slovenia's Adam Cerin tested Predrag Rajkovic in the Serbian goal, while Dusan Vlahovic's diving header threatened Jan Oblak but was comfortably gathered by the Slovenian goalkeeper.\n\nSlovenia came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half when Timi Elsnik unleashed a powerful shot that rattled the post, with Benjamin Se\u0161ko narrowly missing the follow-up over the crossbar. Oblak's assured presence between the posts frustrated Serbian efforts, denying Aleksandar Mitrovic on multiple occasions.\n\nHowever, it was Slovenia who eventually found the breakthrough in the 69th minute. Zan Karnicnik capitalized on Elsnik's precise delivery, sliding the ball past Rajkovic into the far corner, sending the home crowd into jubilation.\n\nDespite the setback, Serbia rallied desperately in search of an equaliser. Mitrovic came agonizingly close with a powerful strike that ricocheted off the crossbar, leaving Dragan Stojkovic's men staring defeat in the face. Yet, in a dramatic twist deep into added time, Luka Jovic emerged as the hero for Serbia, rising high to head home and snatch a crucial point from the jaws of defeat.\n\nThe draw ensures that Serbia's Euro 2024 campaign remains alive, albeit with challenges ahead. Meanwhile, Slovenia will rue missed opportunities but take heart from a resilient performance that almost secured them a historic victory in European Championship competition.\n\nBoth teams now turn their attention to their remaining group stage fixtures, knowing that every point will be vital in their quest for progression in one of football's most prestigious tournaments.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oblak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jan Oblak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timi_Max_El\u0161nik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Timi Max El\u0161nik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j0v2sjz3wta7r9295ftttp6z/whatsapp-image-2024-06-20-at-18-58-47-1-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

After every match you lose you try to find a way to get those points and to plan for the next round,\" Kek said.\n\nEngland beat Serbia 1-0 but endured a nervy second half.\n\n\"Slovenia were not a favourite in this group. They still aren't, although we played very well against Denmark in the second half. But this momentum will have to be carried on into tomorrow's match,\" Kek said.\n\n\"I know it will be a very high hurdle and a great challenge.\"\n\nThe timing of the match with a kickoff of 1300 GMT is less than ideal, Kek said, with temperatures expected to soar to 27 degrees Celsius in Munich.\n\n\"Eleven players will not be enough because of the high tempo, because of the aggressiveness,\" he said.\n\n\"The one who will be braver, who will believe in their abilities more will have more chances to win the match. We will try to do this in our own way.\"\n\nSlovenia are participating in their second European Championship, 24 years after their first. Serbia are playing in the tournament for the first time as an independent nation.\n\n\"I want my team to have respect for the opponent. We are aware of the quality of the Serbian team, of the quality of their manager,\" Kek said. \"They haven't been at the Euros in a very long time.\"\n\nKek said the huge contingent of Slovenian fans would give the team a big confidence boost.\n\n\"I believe that this team will grow from minute to minute in such an atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nSlovenia defender Petar Stojanovic said the team would have to keep their emotions in check.\n\n\"I think this will be a phenomenal match - on the pitch, off the pitch, on the stand, outside in the streets - emotions are running high,\" he said. \"We as players have to hide those emotions. I hope we can show them after the match.\"\n\nKasper Schmeichel says Denmark are facing a better England side than the one that beat them in the Euros semi-finals three years ago - a galling loss that he insists provides no added motivation.\n\nThe Scandinavians are looking to kickstart their Euro 2024 campaign in Frankfurt having been pegged back by Slovenia as their Group C opener ended 1-1 on Sunday.\n\nEngland will seal a place in the round of 16 if they beat Denmark, having defeated Serbia 1-0 in Gelsenkirchen where man-of-the-match Jude Bellingham's early header was the difference.\n\nThe Real Madrid star has become a key player since the nations last met in the Euro 2020 semi-finals and Schmeichel believes Gareth Southgate's men have reached new heights.\n\n\"I think England were a world-class side when we met them,\" the former Leicester goalkeeper said.\n\n\"They got to the final of a major championship, so they were definitely a world-class side when we met them.\n\n\"And I think when you look at some of the additions since and the experience they've gained now over time, I think they're probably a better side now than ever, at least in the time I've been playing them against them.\n\n\"You look at then, all over the pitch they have world-class talent, so they're a very good side and we're going to have to be on top of our game to beat them.\"\n\nDenmark are hoping to avoid falling just short against England on Thursday, having lost 2-1 in extra-time when they last met under the Wembley arch in 2021.\n\nThey had taken the lead in the Euro 2020 semi-final through Mikkel Damsgaard's free-kick but Simon Kjaer's own goal took the match to extra-time, when Kane scored after Schmeichel saved his spot-kick.\n\nThere was a feeling of injustice in Denmark about the decision to award a penalty after Raheem Sterling went down but the long-serving Denmark goalkeeper says he has moved on.\n\n\"I'm not the type of person that is going to be looking back three years to a game and something that happened there to have motivation,\" Schmeichel said.\n\n\"I think the biggest motivating factor for myself is the fact we're playing another Euros with Denmark. That's certainly something we should never take for granted.\"\n\nItaly go into their encounter with Spain hoping to play as elegantly as if they were dressed in their Giorgio Armani suits but they are ready to get themselves dirty if required, according to coach Luciano Spalletti.\n\n\"We wear Giorgio Armani and Giorgio Armani is known around the whole world,\" Spalletti told reporters on Wednesday when asked if the Group B game with Spain (live on RT\u00c92/RT\u00c9 Player) would test his ability to give Italy a new identity, less than a year into the job.\n\n\"We will wear the same suit, we will try to be the same. Of course we really want to play the game our way and to measure ourselves against one of strongest teams...We will be there, well dressed but ready to get our clothes dirty if needed.\"\n\nBoth sides won their opening Euro 2024 games, Spain cruising past Croatia 3-0 while Italy had to overcome the shock of conceding the fastest goal in the history of European Championship tournaments to beat Albania 2-1.\n\nItaly are the defending European champions but they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup - their second such failure in a row - and Spalletti is building a new-look side after his predecessor Roberto Mancini walked out to coach Saudi Arabia.\n\nSpain under Luis de la Fuente are looking for revenge for their elimination by Italy at Euro 2020, the latest twist in a long European Championship history involving the two countries.\n\nThe outcome of contest in the Arena AufSchalke will be crucial in determining who comes top of what is considered the toughest group in this year's tournament, a position that will probably offer an easier tie in the first knockout round.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I think Harry only had the one 90 minutes in over a month, that was the decision that we took.\"\n\n\"A time to stay calm, reflect, try and improve for sure,\" Kane said to the BBC about the result. \"We're struggling with and without the ball, we have to go away and look at it back, the pressure in both games hasn't been quite right.\n\n\"Also with the ball, we haven't been good enough. That's the bottom line from top to bottom from me all the way to Picks (Jordan Pickford), everyone dropping below their level a bit in terms of retaining the ball and playing under pressure. It was tough out there with the heat and the pitch.\"\n\nSporting Lisbon midfielder Morten Hjulmand's strike from distance in the 34th minute earned Denmark a valuable point in Group C. The draw means England remain top with four points from their first two games. Denmark are second, with Slovenia third and Serbia in fourth. Serbia rescued a late draw against Slovenia earlier on Thursday, with Luka Jovic scoring a 95th-minute header from a corner as the game finished 1-1.\n\nDespite the disappointing result, England are still in a strong position to qualify as group leaders, having beaten Serbia 1-0 in their opening game on Sunday.

Slovenia began their Euro 2024 Group C campaign with a 1-1 draw against Denmark in Stuttgart last Sunday.\n\nSerbia, on the other hand, were narrowly defeated 1-0 by tournament favourites England last Sunday.

The two nations meet for the first time since the semi-finals of Euro 2020 when the Three Lions came from behind to win 2-1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThe Danes were held to a draw by Slovenia to open their Group C campaign, heaping the pressure on a side that impressed en route to the semi-finals at the last Euros. Jude Bellingham scored the only goal as Serbia were edged out in Gelsenkirchen, on a night where Gareth Southgate's men made an impressive start to Euro 2024.\n\nDenmark Predicted XI: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund\n\nEngland Predicted XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nMeanwhile, two heavyweights of European football, Spain and Italy, step into the ring on Thursday evening as they aim to secure a place in Euro 2024's knockout phase. Both won their opening Group B fixtures, so one more point should prove enough for the reigning champions and their Nations League nemesis to progress.\n\nWhen Spain coach Luis de la Fuente sent his side out at Berlin's Olympiastadion for their Euro 2024 opener, he could scarcely have dreamed they would return at half-time with a three-goal lead over Croatia. Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz, and Dani Carvajal all scored before the break to start the campaign with a resounding success.\n\nItaly started the defence of their title in the worst possible fashion before quickly recovering from an early blow in Saturday's Group B clash against Albania. Sassuolo's Nedim Bajrami set a new Euros record for the fastest goal ever, netting after just 23 seconds. However, Spalletti's side soon bounced back: Alessandro Bastoni levelled the scores 10 minutes later before his Inter Milan teammate Nicolo Barella put them ahead.\n\nSpain Predicted XI: Simon;

Three years after he suffered a cardiac arrest during play at the last tournament, Eriksen scored the Danes' lone goal.\n\nHe was the only Danish player to maintain his level throughout the game, however, and they conceded an equalizer in a disappointing result.\n\nREAD FULL PREVIEW | Southgate's England looks to be better against Eriksen-inspired Denmark\n\nSPAIN VS ITALY\n\nRetooled versions of Spain and Italy meet on Thursday in a highly anticipated Euro 2024 Group B encounter between the winners of three of the last four European Championships.\n\nSpain thrashed Croatia 3-0 in its opener on Saturday playing a faster, more direct approach than the possession-based \"tiki-taka\" style which saw it crowned European champion in 2008 and 2012 as well as World Cup winner in 2010.\n\nSteering clear of Italy's traditional 'defence-first' Catenaccio system, Spalletti has implemented a more attack-minded approach, which it used to great effect in beating Albania 2-1 in its opener.\n\nREAD FULL PREVIEW | New look Spain and Italy meet in battle of play styles\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)\n\nLatest on SportstarWest Indies vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Chase

The Three Lions escaped with a point, sending them top of Group C ahead of Denmark.\n\nEngland, Denmark and Slovenia can all stop top the group on the final matchday next Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_schofield@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Will Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Warnock", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017dan_Karni\u010dnik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u017dan Karni\u010dnik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33075688.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Slovenia-v-Serbia-Group-C-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 251}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Find out how that plays into a Morten Hjulmand prop in our Euro 2024 betting picks.\n\nThings are starting to get tasty in the second round of Euro 2024 games and we have an important Group C matchup on Thursday in Denmark vs. England.\n\nThe Danes drew to Slovenia in their opener and need to pick up points but now face the tournament favorites in England, who beat Serbia 1-0 in the first game.\n\nSo get stuck into these Denmark vs. England predictions and take a look at our Euro 2024 picks.\n\nThursday's game isn't quite in must-win territory for either team, but it would help immensely.\n\nDenmark drew 1-1 against Slovenia in a game where they were favorites. England beat Serbia 1-0, although it was far from inspiring. The question is: What can we learn from those two games to help us ahead of the sides meeting on Thursday?\n\nThe answer to that revolves around Jude Bellingham. The England ace scored the only goal on Sunday and looked every bit the player that's won La Liga and the Champions League this year. He looked dangerous on the ball, admittedly more so in the first half, and the Serbians were terrified of him. They solved the problem of his talents by continually fouling him.\n\nWe saw Bellingham fouled four times by Serbia, but in truth it probably should have been more. Serbian defenders would go in harder on him and look to make a statement but got away with it on a number of occasions before the ref began to act. Nobody on the pitch was fouled more than him yet he still put up an impressive performance with a Man of the Match result. However, we have seen the blueprint on how to beat him, by kicking lumps out of him every time.\n\nThat brings us to Denmark and finding the player most likely to do that in their lineup, and that should be Morten Hjulmand. The 24-year old started alongside Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in their midfield against Slovenia but it was the Sporting Lisbon player who sat deepest, protecting the Denmark defense, and he even picked up a booking in the process.\n\nA look at his most recent season playing in Portugal shows a player well versed in fouling, averaging 1.4 fouls per game and picking up a staggering 12 cards in 30 games. He's a player who'll likely get stuck into England and in particular Bellingham on Thursday, with Bellingham operating in his section of the pitch. At +180, we're getting a good price on Hjulmand picking up his second card of the tournament as Denmark try to stop England's danger man.\n\nWe've already spoken about the threat that Bellingham can offer England and how rival teams are fearful about him. His 13th-minute header on Sunday was only his fourth England goal in 30 games for his country but he's very much England's most dangerous player alongside Harry Kane.\n\nBellingham's now playing in the same advanced role for England that he has done for Real Madrid in this past season, where he's scored 19 goals in 28 La Liga games for Los Blancos and another four in the Champions League. Playing higher up the pitch makes it easier for him to get involved in attacking transitions, and he often finds himself making runs into the box to create chances. He'll continue to be a major goal threat here.\n\nIn addition to our best bet, we're also going to back England to win. They weren't exceptional against Serbia by any means, but they were very professional and in the second half you got the feeling that they could have attacked more if they'd wanted to.\n\nIt was a pragmatic display which probably sets the tone for England's tournament; keep it tight at the back and protect a weak backline. That should help us land not only England winning, but also Under 2.5 goals here.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/8ac1ada0-91e1-41c1-8468-4713b6e52ea1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

ahead of the Danes, and will secure top spot with victory over Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Southgate's misfiring team, in which right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold's deployment as a

effort, but AC Milan striker Jovic headed home a corner in the fifth minute of added time.\n\nIt proved a better point for Slovenia than it did for the Serbians and they face England knowing victory will see them through.\n\nFrance superstar Kylian Mbappe is facing a race against time to be fit for Friday's Group D clash with the Netherlands.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who broke his nose during the 1-0

The Bologna defender performed admirably throughout and was the unlucky fall guy for Williams' magic.\n\nMuch of the chat around Spain's attack has been about the 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, and for good reason, but tonight his \"older\" counterpart showed that he is the potential ace in the Spanish pack.\n\nLuka Jovi\u0107 might feel hard done by, given his last-gasp equaliser, but Morten Hjulmand's stunning strike against England was something to behold.\n\nHarry Kane's wayward pass inside saw the ball eventually come to the Danish midfielder but the England captain couldn't have guessed what would happen next, nor could anyone in truth. After all, the Sporting midfielder had only scored five times in his entire career and never before for his country.\n\nHe unleashed a thunderbolt from 30 yards out that flew past Jordan Pickford, clipped the post and nestled in the net. Denmark were more than worthy of their point, and what a way to get it.\n\nThe goal, on top of an overall excellent display, will do little to quieten the rumours linking the 24-year-old with a move to one of Europe's biggest clubs this summer.\n\nThe joy and despair as Group C took a late twist.\n\nThe defending champions looked anything but that tonight, as they somehow only lost 1-0.\n\nDespite their questionable displays, England are almost assured of a spot in the last 16 and will top the group with a win against Slovenia, who need a result of their own.\n\nSerbia will need to defeat Denmark to qualify but the Danes could come second with a third draw as Group C goes to the wire.\n\nSpain are through after their win against Italy and will top the group if they avoid defeat against Albania. The Azzuri will likely require a point against Croatia to ensure their defence of the title is extended.\n\nAfter another disjointed performance from his side, England manager Gareth Southgate was honest when he said: \"We struggled to have control in the game, and it lead to an anxious performance. That has to be better if want to go further in the tournament.\"\n\nHis captain Harry Kane added: \"There are no easy games in major tournament football, and I think that's showing. For sure, we've got levels we can reach. It's time to stay calm, a time to reflect and regroup. Step by step, we will get there.\"\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand was understandably happy with his side's showing.\n\n\"We played a good match where we thought we could win. Against England, there was plenty of expression, fire and passion from the players. We are exactly where we need to be in this match, where we delivered for 90 minutes.\"\n\nAfter his side saved themselves with a late goal, Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovi\u0107 was feeling proud.\n\n\"We never gave up, we believed in ourselves until the end. We created so many chances but simply could not score for more than 90 minutes. But we didn't stop, we didn't want to accept losing to Slovenia, and it paid off in the end.\"\n\nFriday marks a week of EURO 2024 action and brings us another three games of huge intrigue.\n\nThe day starts with Ukraine looking to bounce back from their humbling by Romania against Slovakia, who will be feeling confident after their shock win over Belgium.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

Matja\u017e Kek's Slovenia drew with Denmark in the opening fixture and sits in third place in Group C with one point while Serbia went down by a Jude Bellingham goal in their game with England, which set a record for the least shots attempted ever in the history of the Euros.\n\nMoving on at 7 p.m. things start to get more interesting as group favourites Denmark and England clash for a chance to seal their qualification to the round of 16. It will be a re-match of the Euro 2020 semi-finals.\n\nDespite their winning start, England is under pressure, as their performances of late have not been convincing. Manager Gareth Southgate is under fire for his perceived conservative tactics. Critics say that his alleged risk-aversion is preventing him from taking England to the next step after reaching the final and semi-finals of the Euro and the World Cup, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile in Group B, heavyweights Spain and Italy can book their place in the last 16 with a win in the international derby that starts at 10 p.m. La Roja smashed Croatia 3-0 in their opening game with a performance that started raising suspicions that they could be one of the favourites to lift the trophy. Italy on the other hand, achieved a nervy win against hard-fighting Albania, which scored the quickest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds.\n\nAll games will be broadcast live on CyBC and CyBC HD.", "source": {"uri": "in-cyprus.philenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "in-cyprus.philenews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stelios_marathovouniotis@in-cyprus.philenews.com", "name": "Stelios Marathovouniotis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matja\u017e_Kek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matja\u017e Kek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jude-bellingham-england-euro.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661679", "eventUri": "eng-9661679", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 134, "textEnd": 141}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

Most notably, it was an anonymous outing from all three of Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka. The goal itself came from a deflected cross and an instinctive run by Bellingham, otherwise England created virtually nothing the other 89 minutes (0.28 xG).\n\nChristian Eriksen provided the moment of the tournament just 17 minutes into Denmark's 1-1 draw with Slovenia, scoring the opening goal three years and four days after he collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest during the Danes' opening game of EURO 2020. Much like England's opener, it was a tale of two halves with Denmark dominating the opening 45 minutes before struggling (and ultimately failing) to hold on to a narrow lead late. Slovenia racked up all of 0.06 xG on three shots (all from 25 yards or more) in the first half and followed it up with 1.04 xG on eight shots (six from inside 10 yards) after the restart. It tracks with the early trend of teams being rewarded for being aggressive and taking risks, and the opposite has certainly proven true as well.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's run in midfield could to come to an end after just one game, as he struggled both in possession and defensively, and the side was instantly improved when Conor Gallagher came on to replace him after 70 minutes. Whether or not Alexander-Arnold falls back into contention at right back, where Kyle Walker started the opener and did yeoman's work from end line to end line. The other spot where a change could be made, pending fitness, is left back. Kieran Trippier played there against Serbia as Luke Shaw makes his way back from the calf injury that ended his season for Manchester United back in February. Southgate has said that Shaw could be available during the group stage, but Man United boss Erik ten Hag believes the round of 16 is a more realistic target.\n\nDenmark can defend and they're able to hold possession better than Serbia, but they will also find it difficult to create chances and England will come out with an intensity that was missing in the opener.

We do not give up and will not give up. We believed all the way until the end and the result came as a reward for believing.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Serbian FA released a statement - which they are now expected to retract - condemning UEFA's failure to punish Albania and Croatia supporters for anti-Serb chants in Hamburg.\n\nThey claim both sets of fans were singing: \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" during the second half of Wednesday's pulsating 2-2 thriller.\n\nSerbia's general secretary Jovan Surbatovic said: \"What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition.\"\n\nHead coach Stojkovic refused to be drawn on the saga, claiming he wasn't aware of the statement.\n\nHe added: \"Please, ask me something about the game. It's not my intention to talk about this, it's not important. Honestly speaking I didn't read anything. Believe it or not but I didn't.\"\n\nSerbia had been left to rue so many opportunities when Slovenia took the lead on 69 minutes. Timi Max Elsnik, who fired against the woodwork in the first half, sent a dangerous ball flying across the face of goal for right-back Zan Karnicnik to turn home.\n\nBut Serbia continued to create chances at will. Mitrovic and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic couldn't buy a goal despite hitting a combined 58 for their respective clubs this season.\n\nMitrovic had nodded one wide of the mark at the back post before Jan Oblak made two top stops either side of half time to deny the ex-Fulham frontman.\n\nThen Jovic showed his team-mates how it was done, glancing home from a corner to break Slovenian hearts as Matjaz Kek's troops collapsed to their knees in despair.\n\nKlaus Gjasula's 95th-minute equaliser for Albania against Croatia was the latest goal in European Championships history but that record barely lasted 24 hours.\n\nStojkovic continued: \"I am still not sure how Mitrovic's chances didn't turn into a goal but in these situations you need a bit of luck. Luka Jovic is a player that can turn any opportunity into a goal, that's why we refreshed the attacking formation.\n\n\"I would have been really dissatisfied if we completed the match with all those shots and no goal.

Rice was probably England's best player in terms of his all-round performance.\n\n\"That says it all about the performance, when your best player is a defensive midfielder against Serbia. Foden, Saka and Kane were quiet. They weren't good enough - they didn't do enough.\n\n\"I know that some of England's big players are coming into the tournament after a long season, and it can be difficult to make your mark in the opening game of a tournament. The most important thing is to win the opening game, and sometimes players are scared to not lose the first game.\n\n\"That is what happened and it contributed to England's performance. For England, the victory will build confidence and the second game will be better because of it. I think England were a bit scared (to lose) against Serbia.\n\n\"Now they have the three points on the board, I expect them to look much better against Denmark.\" England boss Gareth Southgate, however, was not concerned by the performance and believes their second half dip was down to the fact several players were undercooked heading into the tournament.\n\n\"I thought physically we had players that needed the game,\" Southgate said. \"We've had a lot of players that hadn't played 90 minutes for a long time. We expended a lot of energy in that first half.\n\n\"I knew that we would dip. And it was a good moment to bring Conor [Gallagher] into the game, who can get up to the ball and provide that bit more defensive solidity at that time.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot of new players, young players, so the team that started was a very experienced team in terms of international and club bar Marc, really, who had a brilliant game.

The RB Leipzig striker played 76 minutes for Slovenia against Serbia, and despite having two touches in the box and one big chance, the final product was zero goals. At least teammate Zan Karnicnik managed to hit the goal, making it 1-0 for Slovenia, and Sesko and Co. seemed destined to reach the next round. But instead, Luka Jovi\u0107 scored with the game's final touch to make it 1-1.\n\nThe result means that Slovenia now need to beat England in the final game of the group stage to advance. \"It is very frustrating,\" Slovenia playmaker Timi Max Elsnik said. \"We thought we were qualified, and then it was gone in a blink of an eye.\" Slovenia are at the tournament for the first time in 24 years and despite having a young and exciting squad, the lack of experience perhaps showed in that moment. That lack of experience might also be a factor in why Sesko hasn't scored yet at the Euros despite having several chances.\n\nIt wasn't for a lack of moments, either. Although Sesko has a relatively low combined xG of 0.5 from the two games against Serbia and Slovenia, there were moments when the 21-year-old came close. What is missing for Sesko to finally get his first goal at Euro 2024 and perhaps help his team secure a win and passage to the next round? \"A bit of luck,\" Elsnik said. \"Everything is so close. He hit the post against Denmark today. He had a great shot, but the keeper made an amazing safe.\"\n\nSesko for Slovenia: \"We aren't Leipzig\" - \"He is our main guy\"\n\nAnother factor is that Sesko plays a different role for Slovenia than he does for his club team, Leipzig. \"He is doing a lot for this team; we aren't Leipzig and attacking 70% of the time,\" Elsnik said. \"So, he is losing a lot of energy in defense. We need him as he is sacrificing himself a little bit. He is trying his best also when we don't have good solutions. He makes bad balls look like good balls.\"\n\nAlthough, like Slovenia, RB Leipzig often play on the counter as well, there are some differences. Except for perhaps Bayern Munich and Leverkusen, Leipzig go into every Bundesliga game as the favorite. That means that despite a counter-pressing system, the attacking line is pushed further forward, which means Sesko has to cover less ground for Leipzig than Slovenia. Hence, the striker, who recently renewed his contract with the Red Bulls, ending speculations about a transfer to the Premier League, is playing a different role for his country.\n\nDespite that, Elsnik is certain that the goals will come for Sesko. \"I think he is close to the first goal,\" the midfielder said. \"He is still young and will get goals. Whether it is against England or in future European Championships.

The president hailed the church for the role the church played during the Tropical Cyclone Freddy whereby the church built 21 houses. Bishop Richard Allen founded the church in 1816Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States of America, and was brought into the country by Reverend Hannock Msokera in 1924. Allen formed the church by gathering together five African American congregations of the previously established Methodist Episcopal Church with the hope of escaping the discrimination that was commonplace in society, including churches. The church is already operating 26 primary schools and two secondary schools in Malawi which is a significant contribution to Malawi. It is also believed that African Methodist Episcopal Church through Reverend Msokera also contributed to the education of Malawi\u2019s first President Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda.

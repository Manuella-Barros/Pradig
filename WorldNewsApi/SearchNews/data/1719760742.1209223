{"id": 225019078, "title": "Greece &#8211; Offering Electric Vehicle Subsidies &#8211; Won\u2019t Allow Some on Ferries", "text": "ATHENS \u2013 While even state subsidies to buy electric cars haven\u2019t worked because they are still too expensive, those in Greece who have them \u2013 or hybrids with high-voltage battery charge levels more than 40 percent \u2013 won\u2019t be allowed on ferry boats. That\u2019s under a new regulation from the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy which means that vehicles that don\u2019t comply can\u2019t be put on board the boats that are the only way to get them to islands. In what it said was a \u201cbizarre\u201d measure, the site AutoEvolution pointed out the barrier for electric vehicle users which means those charged up over the 40 percent limit will be prohibited from ferries. If the car owners keep the batteries below a 40 percent charge \u2013 it wasn\u2019t said how that would be measured at ports \u2013 then they run the risk of not finding charging stations on islands where they are going. The site said that was done for safety measures although fires on Greek ferry boats have been attributed to gasoline powered vehicles on board. The site said that the ministry\u2019s decision \u201cmeans that anti-EV propaganda prevailed over facts.\u201d It added the ruling was \u201cbased on the assumption that electric vehicles are dangerous\u201d although the site said statistics have found that electric cars are 16 times less likely to catch fire compared to combustion engines, although extinguishing a fire caused by an electric vehicle requires expertise. Greece also has only about 2,000 charging stations, few on islands, so landing on one without a fully charged battery or being able to recharge it means the car couldn\u2019t be moved back off the island onto a ferry. \u201cDraining the battery while the car is parked is quite hard, so your best bet is driving. Now imagine the effect of dozens of EVs driving around the port just to drain the battery so they can continue their journey over the sea,\u201d the site said. Drivers of vehicles using alternative fuels like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) also face restrictions as their tanks can\u2019t be filled more than 50 percent of capacity.", "summary": "<p>ATHENS &#8211;\u00a0While even state subsidies to buy electric cars haven&#8217;t worked because they are still too expensive, those in Greece&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/greece-offering-electric-vehicle-subsidies-wont-allow-some-on-ferries/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Greece &#8211; Offering Electric Vehicle Subsidies &#8211; Won\u2019t Allow Some on Ferries</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/greece-offering-electric-vehicle-subsidies-wont-allow-some-on-ferries/\">Greece &#8211; Offering Electric Vehicle Subsidies &#8211; Won\u2019t Allow Some on Ferries</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/greece-offering-electric-vehicle-subsidies-wont-allow-some-on-ferries/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6161151-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:52:08", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.545}

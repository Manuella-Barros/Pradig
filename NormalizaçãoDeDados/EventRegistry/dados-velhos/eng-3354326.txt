endangered whales.\n\nThe speed limit was capped at 10 knots (11.5 miles, 18.5 kilometers) per hour -- about half the average current speeds -- in areas where whales have been reported.\n\nThe move follows two months that saw an average of one North Atlantic right whale per week found dead in the shipping channel, which connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA decomposed whale carcass was also recovered off the coast of the US state of Massachusetts this week, bringing the whale death toll in the northeastern coastal region that includes the US and Canada to twelve.\n\nPreliminary examinations of the carcasses found evidence that the endangered marine mammals died of blunt trauma, likely from collisions with vessels. Some showed signs of having been tangled up in fishing nets.\n\nA necropsy report will be released next month, said Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc.\n\nFederal officials hope limiting boat speeds will allow whales time to get out of the way of vessels and, if they fail to, limit injuries.\n\n\"We are taking the situation of endangered species very seriously,\" Transport Minister Marc Garneau told journalists.\n\n\"We know that an unprecedented number of right whales are currently in Canadian waters and that makes them vulnerable to navigation. They may have been hit by ship,\" he said.\n\n\"We are taking steps to reduce the risks of other deaths in that area.

She said the Martha's Vineyard Landbank Commission sent photos to NOAA Fisheries which confirmed it was a North Atlantic right whale.\n\nStory continues below\n\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare, located on Cape Cod, Mass., is performing a necropsy Wednesday to determine what caused the death of another endangered right whale.

In an email, she said final results of the necropsy report have not been received but the initial analysis was the death was due to the whale being struck by a vessel.\n\nIFAW to perform necropsy in coordination with @NOAA on male right whale off Martha's Vineyard. pic.twitter.com/55EWUmrPr6\n\n-- IFAW (@action4ifaw) August 9, 2017\n\nDFO Minister Dominic LeBlanc said last week it's believed 80 to 100 right whales are currently in the gulf and the DFO says in total, there are approximately only 525 right whales in the world.\n\nVarious precautions have also been taken as a result of the deaths, including asking mariners to slow their ships to 10 knots when passing through the areas and limiting the amount of rope they have on the water. LeBlanc said collisions with ships and fishing gear entanglements are major threats to the whales.\n\nDuring one entanglement last month, however, a veteran fisherman from Campobello, N.B. was killed while freeing a whale.\n\nThis incident prompted Canada and the United States to temporarily suspend efforts to rescue entangled whales.\n\nWATCH: The International Fund for Animal Welfare explains how the Campobello Whale Rescue Team untangled a right whale in the Bay of Fundy.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Canadian efforts to disentangle right whales remain unauthorized but Goebel said Wednesday that disentanglements of other whales have been authorized once again in the U.S. The rescue for right whales can take place as well, but NOAA asks rescuers to check with them first and each will be looked at on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"Right whales are extremely powerful and therefore somewhat dangerous when you're doing disentanglement,\" Goebel said.\n\nAuthorization of disentanglements came after U.S. officials conducted an investigation of what happened to fisherman Joe Howlett took place, and following a review of safety protocols, it was determined safe for responders to respond to other whales.\n\nShe said Canada and the U.S. are staying in constant communication about the issue.\n\nREAD MORE: Ottawa will do what is needed to protect 'majestic' right whales, minister says\n\nThe right whale that was found in Martha's Vineyard is \"very decomposed\", but there is no indication yet on how the whale died.\n\nGoebel added the NOAA Fisheries ask people out on the water in an area right whales have been seen to go slow.", "timeCrawl": "19:34:00", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-09", "textStart": 1926, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1940}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8259871", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

With just over 500 animals left, any decrease in the population is not a good sign for the species. Unfortunately, since June, ten whale carcasses have been found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where the whales spend their summers. This is an unprecedented number of dead whales, the likes of which haven't been seen since whaling was outlawed in 1986, according to marine biologist Tonya Wimmer. Researchers know of only three calves born this summer, so these losses could be catastrophic to the population.\n\nWhat's worse is that examinations of the whales show that the majority of the deaths were due to human activity. The Gulf is a high-traffic area with large vessels either passing through or fishing. Most of these whales suffered blunt-force trauma from either ships or human equipment. One whale died from chronic entanglement-having a piece of fishing equipment stuck on it for too long.\n\nDetangling has been put on hold indefinitely by the government for the safety of rescuers and researchers. This means that any whales currently suffering from being enmeshed in ropes or nets will have to stay that way until the ban is lifted.\n\nWell, that all sounds mighty disheartening, what's the good news? The good news is: the government is finally doing something about it. On Friday, Transport Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard announced a temporary mandatory slow-down order for vessels 20 meters or more in length in the area. Those who don't abide by the speed limit-which will be enforced both by sea and air-will face fines of up to $25,000. The order will remain in place until the whales migrate to Georgia and Florida waters for the winter. The government is also asking smaller vessels to slow down voluntarily when passing through the Gulf.\n\nThe positive side to the fact that these whale deaths are the result of human activity is that it means it's within our power to stop them. Unfortunately, the whale population has a slow growth-rate so it will take decades for it to recover from its endangered status, but we can make sure fewer die of unnatural causes. Researchers are looking into stopping entanglements before they occur by experimenting with rope-less fishing-a practice they use to protect marine life in Australia.\n\nWe need more permanent protections than the temporary slow-down though, especially in the Gulf of St. Lawrence area. This summer, there are five times the usual number of right whales in the Gulf and scientists don't see that number decreasing next year. They suggest climate change is to blame-that the food supply in other areas has been depleted, forcing them to seek out new sources. Hopefully, the order-and implementing it every year-will protect the right whale population enough for us to see it grow.", "timeCrawl": "20:40:00", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8697696", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Three whales died from blunt force trauma consistent with being struck by a large vessel and one was entangled in fishing nets.\n\nWimmer said reducing ship speeds can improve the chance of survival for the whales.

Lawrence?\n\nRight whales have been featured in the news a lot lately because of an unprecedented number of deaths in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nKim Davies, a post-doctoral fellow in Dalhousie University's department of oceanography, said that the dwindling population has been a source of worry for years.\n\n\"This year is just, I don't know, it comes on after we've been concerned about right whales since about 2010,\" she said.\n\n\"So just to have this happen now, after concern for so long is really disheartening.\"\n\nDavies said that right whales are unique among baleen whales in several ways, some of which could be contributing to the deaths.\n\nDiet is one key difference according to Davies.\n\nRight whales eat one specific type of zooplankton called calanus, a marine copepod, and they only eat it at a particular time in the organisms life-cycle.\n\nThe calanus feed through the winter and early spring, then go into hibernation and by mid-summer are accumulating in basins throughout the North Atlantic.\n\nRight whales' diets consist solely of the calanus, whereas other baleen whales eat it as well as small fish and other types of zooplankton.\n\nDavies said that right whales are \"morphologically and physiologically\" designed to feed on the calanus.\n\n\"Unlike most other things in the ocean, they're actually able to digest this fat that's inside of this particular life stage of their food,\" Davies said.\n\nRight whales also forage for food differently than other baleen whales through ram-filter-feeding.\n\nDavies said they have two rows of baleen, what she described as a bristle-like filter in their mouths, the front row with a gap, and the back row with two gaps.\n\n\"They can just skim through the water and ... water will come in through the gap in the front and go out through the gaps in the back,\" she said.\n\nThis offers them a unique way of feeding without having to slow down.\n\n\"They can continuously swim and just filter, filter, filter that water without ever having to do any gulping or anything like that.\"\n\n\"So that allows them to dive down to 200 metres and essentially open their mouths and swim without losing any power.\"\n\n\"It's a totally different way of feeding ... like a lawnmower.\"\n\nDavies said their uniquely particular eating habits bring them to the specific areas where the calanus congregate.\n\nThe basins where calanus collect become feeding points for the right whale community.\n\nBecause they are looking for these very specific zooplankton at a particular time in their life-cycle, the right whales are looking for areas of ocean which are supportive of a calanus population.\n\n\"Those conditions do not occur everywhere there's very particular oceanographic conditions that aggregate their food,\" she said.\n\n\"To expend all that energy and dive down to 200 metres and you know filter out all that food and stuff, it takes a tremendous amount of energy so they are looking for really highly concentrated patches of their food.\"\n\nThe way right whales feed, what they eat, and where they have to go to find calanus may be a contributing factor in the deaths in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nDavies said that calanus collect in shallower waters, which bring the whales within 100 kilometres of the coast.\n\nThese are busier areas of the water which are also more dangerous for them.\n\n\"They're the same areas where there's all different kinds of industrial activities,\" she said.\n\n\"All different kinds of fisheries go on in these areas, there are shipping lanes, habitual traffic patterns, there's large vessels, there's smaller vessels.\"\n\nFor this reason, she said, right whales have been referred to as \"the urban whale.\"\n\nDavies said that there are a number of contributing factors into the high number of right whale deaths.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet that is going to answer the question of why all these right whales are dying this year,\" she said.\n\n\"The last several years have been bad for right whales.\"\n\nDavies said that fewer calves are being born each year, which could indicate a stress of some kind on the population.\n\nShe also said that there has been a substantial decline in sightings in their usual habitats, which suggests that the food supply in those areas is insufficient.\n\n\"These are all potentially mitigating factors that are contributing to reduced health in the population,\" she said.\n\nThis reduced health could be another factor in the die-off.\n\n\"A combination of the health of the population, the fact that they're migrating widely in search of food, and I don't know potentially other factors that we haven't thought of yet,\" said Davies.\n\nShe said that right whales have encountered fishing gear and ships for years but their reduced health could make them \"more susceptible to mortality if they do encounter a threat.\"\n\n\"So why all the deaths this year? I can't help but think that the health of the population may have something to do with it.\"\n\n\"It's unprecedented, it's unique and I don't why they're all dying.\"", "timeCrawl": "11:33:00", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "7961215", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "id": 213, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 3}}

(Credit: ABC licensed)\n\nIt's been a bumper baby season off Victoria's south-western coastline, with a fourth southern right whale calf born at the traditional whale nursery at Warrnambool.\n\nWhile it's good news, there's still a long way to go before the mammal can be taken off the critically endangered list -- with an estimated 3,500 left worldwide.\n\nThere were concerns last year when no females returned on their three-year breeding cycle to calve at Warrnambool's Logans Beach, but the sight of a fourth calf frolicking with its mother has renewed confidence for the future of the species.\n\n\"This year, they've really made up for it,\" Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning senior biodiversity officer Mandy Watson said.\n\nThe last big calving season was in 2013. The record number of calves born at Logans Beach is six baby whales in 2009.\n\nSouthern right whale populations were nearly wiped out by extensive whaling in the 1800s. The species is prized for its blubber and baleen.\n\nAbout 300 individual whales are now found around the south east of Australia, compared to a population of up to 30,000 humpback whales on both the east and west coasts.\n\nSmall groups have also been spotted at other locations along the coast including Portland, Port Fairy and Western Port Bay.\n\n\"We've got a really small population compared to humpback whales, so they've got a really long way to go before they're recovered from commercial whaling,\" Ms Watson said.\n\n\"There would have been tens of thousands of these whales historically before they were hunted, so we're really a long way from that.\"\n\nResearchers are conducting a crowd-sourced identification program for the southern right whale population.\n\n\"We can track individual whales because of the pattern of skin markings on their heads and every individual whale is born with its own unique pattern,\" Ms Watson said.\n\n\"We can photograph them and we use those images of the head to track individuals and I have a catalogue of about 300 whales.\"\n\nBut officials are warning people not to get too close, with fines being issued for people flying drones within 500 metres of the whales.\n\nThe buzzing from drone motors has the potential to cause distress to noise-sensitive whales.\n\nCapturing images of the whales and their calves has become a labour of love for Chris Farrell.\n\nHe has thousands of aerial photographs, using a long telephoto lens to capture the magnificent mammals from a fixed-wing aircraft at a safe distance so as not to disturb the whales.\n\n\"When you're in the plane, I can see everything that's going on,\" Mr Farrell said.\n\n\"I'm witnessing their private life ... when you see the calves playing with their mothers, they're actually quite relaxed.\n\n\"It's not work, it is a passion and I want to help with such a critically endangered species.\"", "timeCrawl": "23:46:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8292613", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

mandatory slowdown for vessels of 20 metres or more in length to address the deaths of North Atlantic right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, CBC News has learned.\n\nMinister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard Dominic LeBlanc and Minister of Transport Marc Garneau are scheduled to hold a news conference at the Pointe-du-Ch\u00eane Wharf in southeastern New Brunswick at 10:30 a.m. AT to announce the new temporary measures.\n\nThe slowdown will affect vessels travelling in the western Gulf of St. Lawrence, from the Quebec north shore to just north of Prince Edward Island.\n\nThe measure will be enforced by Transport Canada inspectors and the Canadian Coast Guard's Marine Communications and Traffic Services.\n\nVessels that don't comply face an Administrative Monetary Penalty of $6,000 to $25,000. The measure will be enforced until the whales have migrated from the areas of concern.\n\nSources also say Ottawa will \"continue to consider all options\" to help prevent future whale deaths.\n\nTen of the endangered whales have died in the gulf since June 7. Two others have washed up dead in the Masshachusetts area in recent weeks.\n\nPreliminary necropsy reports on some of the gulf deaths suggest ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement are possible causes.\n\nLast week, LeBlanc pledged the federal government would do whatever it takes to prevent further deaths of the \"iconic animals\" in the busy gulf, which connects central and Eastern Canada to international shipping markets.\n\n\"Every option to protect right whales is on the table,\" the minister had said, citing changes to shipping lanes, increased aerial surveillance, remote-controlled acoustic equipment, or changes to fishing gear among the possibilities.\n\nOnly about 500 right whales are left in the world, according to fisheries officials.\n\nMarine mammal experts have called on the government to take immediate steps to prevent further deaths.\n\nLeBlanc has said the two federal departments are working closely together and with some of the best scientists in the world to address the \"serious and troubling situation\" that poses a threat to Canada's global reputation.\n\nHe expects a final report by mid-September, he had said.\n\nSome steps already taken by Fisheries and Oceans Canada have included closing the snow crab fishery early in some parts of the gulf and asking boats to voluntarily slow down along the Laurentian Channel in shipping lanes between the Magdalen Islands and the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula. Lower boat speeds give whales a better chance of surviving an impact.\n\nThe department has also asked commercial fishermen to watch for whales and report any sightings.", "timeCrawl": "10:06:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-06-07", "textStart": 1200, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1206}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8586188", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "id": 449, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 17}}

vessels of 20 metres or more in length to protect the population of endangered North Atlantic right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, federal officials announced today.\n\nThe announcement by Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Fisheries and Oceans Minister Dominic LeBlanc comes following the deaths of ten of the endangered whales in the gulf since early June. Two others have washed up dead in the Massachusetts area in recent weeks.\n\nPreliminary necropsy reports on some of the gulf deaths suggest ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement are possible causes.\n\n\"In recent months an alarming number of deaths involving North Atlantic right whales have captivated the imagination of Canadians and people around the world,\" LeBlanc said at a joint press conference in Sh\u00e9diac, New Brunswick. \"This endangered species of marine mammal needs protection and the Government of Canada and Canadians will do what we have to do to ensure not only the protection of North Atlantic right whales but also the recovery of this species as well.\"\n\nThere are only about 500 hundred right whales left in the world and research shows that for an unknown reason a large part of them - anywhere between 80 and 100 mammals - have migrated to the Gulf of St. Lawrence this summer, LeBlanc said.\n\nThe area has an intense commercial fishery and is a busy transport corridor for maritime shipping, he said.\n\n\"In our efforts to do everything possible to prevent further whale deaths, our government is today implementing a temporary mandatory slow down for vessels of 20 metres or more in length,\" Garneau said. \"Speed must be reduced to a maximum of 10 knots when travelling in the western Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Quebec north shore to just north of Prince Edward Island. This temporary measure is effective immediately.\"\n\nTransport Canada inspectors, with assistance from the Canadian Coast Guard's Marine Communications and Traffic Services, will enforce this precautionary measure until the whales have migrated from the areas of concern, Garneau said.\n\nFailure to comply will result in a penalty of up to $25,000, he said.\n\nThe government has also taken measures to limit potential hazards to the whale population posed by the region's fishery industry, LeBlanc said.\n\n\"To help prevent entanglements, the Snow Crab Fishing Area 12 in the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was closed, and other fixed gear fisheries such as rock and toad crab fisheries have either been restricted to fish in shallow water or have had a delayed opening,\" LeBlanc said. \"Future fisheries decisions relating to the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence will take the presence of North Atlantic right whales into account.\"\n\nMonitoring and enforcement of new measures will continue with Transport Canada's National Aerial Surveillance Program and Fisheries and Oceans surveillance overflights to aid these new measures, Garneau said.\n\nThe Shipping Federation of Canada (SFC), an industry group that represents the ocean-going flying-flag shipping industry which carries the majority of Canadian exports and imports, said while it supports the government's efforts to protect the endangered whale population, it wants to make sure the measures do not unduly hurt the industry.\n\nThe shipping industry has been quite active on those issues both for the North Atlantic right whale, the belugas and the Southern Resident killer whales off the Pacific Coast, said Sonia Simard, the SFC's director of legislative and environmental affairs.\n\n\"Now, it's an issue with the size and location of the area,\" Simard told RCI. \"We understand the situation is critical and the need to take precautionary action. Now we need to seat down and ensure that this precautionary measure is well-targeted as much as possible so that it delivers on the conservation objective while minimizing the impact on shipping.\"\n\nThe mandatory slowdown could have serious consequences for the shipping industry and the Canadian economy, Simard warned.\n\nFor example, a container vessel usually travels at speeds between 18 and 20 knots, Simard said.\n\n\"The container vessels are like your bus,\" Simard said. \"They have a very tight schedule to make.\"\n\nSlowing down to 10 knots would add anywhere between five and eight hours to the vessel's journey to the Port of Montreal, she said.\n\nFor bulk carrying vessels, which usually go slower than container ships, the slowdown could add three to five hours to their journey, Simard said.\n\n\"In navigation time is of the essence,\" she said. \"When you look at adding time to a voyage, that means additional costs for ship owners and on the other hand it could have an impact on the overall efficiency of the shipping corridors and the competitiveness of Canada versus other ports.\"", "timeCrawl": "17:17:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8669013", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

as it tries to protect right whales who frequent the waters.\n\nTen of the endangered mammals have died in the gulf since early June -- at least some after colliding with ships.\n\nFisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Transport Minister Marc Garneau went to Pointe-du-Chene, N.B., Friday to announce immediate temporary measures aimed at preventing further whale deaths.\n\nGarneau said vessels of 20 metres or more will be required to slow to 10 knots -- or about 19 kilometres per hour -- while travelling in the western Gulf of St. Lawrence, from the Quebec north shore to just north of Prince Edward Island. The limits of that zone are subject to change, he said.\n\n\"These are reasonable measures to accomplish something very important,\" Garneau said. \"I think that Canadians and the shipping industry and the fishing industry recognize that this is something most unusual and we need to take measures.\"\n\nThe measure will be enforced by Transport Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard. Ships that don't comply with the speed limit will be subject to a financial penalty of up to $25,000.\n\nSmaller ships are being asked to voluntarily abide by the speed limit, which will remain in place until the whales have migrated from the areas of the gulf that pose the most concern.\n\nThe measure was designed in consultation with the fishing and shipping industries, who Garneau said have for the most part embraced the conservation effort.\n\n\"We do realize that there is some impact, but I think the marine industry also recognizes that we are trying to achieve something extremely important,\" he said.\n\nGarneau said cruising speeds typically hover around 15 knots, on average, but faster vessels can reach up to 25 knots.\n\nThe speed limit is meant to reduce the frequency and fatality of ship strikes, he said.\n\nFederal officials did their \"homework\" before deciding on the measure, the minister said, including working with their U.S. counterparts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which implemented similar speed restrictions in right whale habitats in 2010.\n\nLeBlanc said the federal government has spent around $360,000 on performing necropsies, akin to animal autopsies, on six whale carcasses. He said the full results of these examinations are expected to be released next month.\n\nEarly findings suggest some of the whales died of either entanglements with fishing gear, or from blunt trauma caused by ship collisions.\n\nIt's believed 80 to 100 right whales are currently in the gulf, LeBlanc said, and scientists expect the mammals to migrate south some time this fall.\n\nThe Fisheries Department has already taken steps to prevent further deaths, including shortening the snow crab season and asking fishermen in the gulf to report any whale sightings.\n\nLeBlanc said the existing measures will be continuously reviewed based on aerial surveillance of the whales' migration patterns. He said further steps may include temporary fishery closures, changes to fishing gear, and shipping lane adjustments.\n\nThe speed restrictions could lead to up to seven-hour delays for some voyages, according to the Ottawa-based Chamber of Marine Commerce, but president Bruce Burrows said industry stakeholders are committed to protecting marine life.\n\n\"These recent whale deaths are deeply troubling for our members too,\" Burrows said in a statement. \"It's critical that industry and government continue to work closely together to develop solutions based on strong science that both protect marine wildlife and minimize economic impacts.\"\n\nThe chamber, which represents around 130 marine industry stakeholders, said ship owners are assessing how the measure will affect deliveries and passenger trips along Quebec's north shore.\n\nBurrows said ship owners have hewed to voluntary protection measures when possible and urged the federal government to \"accelerate\" its analysis of the right whale deaths.\n\nA spokesperson for Oceanex, a Newfoundland-based shipping company, declined to comment on the matter Friday. But Oceanex's Sid Hynes told CBC last week that speed reductions could have \"huge\" financial consequences for his fleet -- and that cost would be passed on to consumers.\n\nMoira Brown, a right whale expert with the Canadian Whale Institute, said compliance will be key to preventing further losses, but industry has proved to be a willing partner in the past.\n\n\"There's a very positive reaction on the part of some (ship owners), and I've heard some things about feeling it was going to cost more money,\" Brown said in an interview. \"It's going to take a little time to get used to this idea and adjust their voyage planning in order to compensate for it.\"\n\nIn a statement, the World Wildlife Fund Canada called the speed restriction a \"good start,\" but said making the measure permanent is one of many steps Ottawa must take to reverse the endangered species' decline.\n\nIt's estimated there are only about 500 North Atlantic right whales alive.", "timeCrawl": "21:11:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8702074", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Three whales died from blunt force trauma consistent with being struck by a large vessel and one was entangled in fishing nets.\n\nWimmer said reducing ship speeds can improve the chance of survival for the whales. The whales can weigh up to 96,000 kilograms (105.8 tons).\n\nThe order will be enforced by Transport Canada inspectors and the Canadian Coast Guard. It is effective immediately and will be lifted once the whales have migrated from the area, usually by the time of the northern winter.

dead this summer, although the others were found in Canadian waters.\n\nThe latest dead whale was discovered Tuesday, floating offshore near the town of Edgartown, said Jennifer Goebel, a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe agency also found a right whale in U.S. waters this spring. Goebel said that on average, the agency finds about three of the endangered animals dead every year, she said Wednesday.\n\nStaff at the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank alerted the agency to the most recent death, she said.\n\n\"We confirmed that is was a North Atlantic right whale with advanced decomposition,\" said Goebel.\n\nShe said the degree of decomposition indicated the whale had been in the water for some time.\n\nA necropsy started Wednesday, but Goebel said it will likely take months to find a cause of death.\n\nCollisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear are suspected in the earlier whale deaths.\n\n\"As far as we know, they're all part of the one North Atlantic right whale population,\" Goebel said.\n\nFewer than 500 North Atlantic right whales remain.\n\nIn June, six right whales were discovered floating dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Necropsy reports suggest some of the whales died from ship strikes and fishing-gear entanglement.\n\nLeBlanc said he's mulled changes in fishing gear, including ensuring fishermen leave a \"minimum amount of rope\" floating on the surface.\n\n\"If you put your crab trap in 200 feet of water, maybe you don't need 350 feet of rope because 150 feet of that will be floating across the surface,\" he said.\n\nWhen whales eat plankton floating on the surface, there's a risk they'll get caught in the rope.\n\n\"In deeper water ... where there are so many right whales, that represents a real threat,\" LeBlanc said.\n\nBut some fishermen say longer lines are necessary to make sure balloon and buoy markers, which are connected by rope to the traps, remain on the surface in strong currents.\n\n\"Once the tide gets going, the tide will suck your balloon under, your rope will be underwater and you won't be able to get your balloon back,\" said Gregory Walters, who fishes lobster out of the Port Maitland area north of Yarmouth, N.S.\n\n\"If them people shorten the ropes, they won't be able to get their gear back.\"\n\nSusan Beaton agrees. She fishes lobster near Antigonish, N.S., and runs a Facebook page called The Gulf Area Fishing News, which has more than 6,000 members.\n\nShe said fishermen use \"the amount of rope that is prudent for the fishery we're conducting.\"\n\n\"We don't use miles of extra rope. I mean, that's a cost factor, right?\" she said.\n\nBeaton said Maine has implemented some measures to try to reduce whale entanglements, including using brightly colour rope and breakaway gear, which has weak points that will snap if too much pressure is exerted. She suggested increasing monitoring of whales to help prevent their deaths.\n\nForcing fishermen to use shorter ropes would have an economic impact, Walters said.\n\n\"It'd probably keep you in real, real shallow water and then once it gets cold, there's no lobsters in shallow water so you wouldn't make any money.\"\n\nBeaton said she's worried a decision will be made too hastily.\n\n\"Changes may come into play that are completely unnecessary because next year the whales are somewhere else.\"\n\nColin Sproul of the Bay of Fundy Inshore Fishermen's Association said it's important the Department of Fisheries and Oceans knows for sure what's causing the deaths before making changes.\n\n\"Of the 10 whales, I think one has been attributed to an entanglement,\" he said. \"The rest are ship strikes or blunt force trauma or unknowns.\"\n\nHe said when fishing rope is left behind floating on the water, it's often because shipping traffic has accidentally cut the lines.\n\n\"Everyone has responsibility in this. It's not just fishermen,\" Sproul said. \"It's all too easy to blame it on fishermen. We're the easiest industry to control. Have they stopping shipping traffic in the gulf to protect these whales? ... No.\"\n\nThe federal government closed the snow crab fishery two days early in response to the whale deaths. It has also asked mariners to slow down in the area.\n\nA group of scientists is working to come up with recommendations, and LeBlanc said he expects to receive a report by mid-September.", "timeCrawl": "19:04:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-06-07", "textStart": 541, "amb": false, "textEnd": 547}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8044497", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "id": 106, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "id": 991, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 11}}

It would be far more effective to remove the possibility of inflicting permanent damage on the ecosystem they depend on for their very existence.'\n\nThe federal government is making a lot of the right noises in promising to do all it can to prevent more deaths among right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc vowed last week to bring \"absolutely every protection to bear\" to safeguard this rare and precious species.\n\nYet at the same time the government is undermining its own good intentions by opening the way for what scientists and environmentalists fear could be an even more devastating blow to the whales and to hundreds of other species of marine wildlife that live in the Gulf.\n\nBarely six weeks ago, the government released regulations that would allow exploration for oil and gas in most of an area that has been designated as a marine protection area in the Laurentian Channel, where the Gulf meets the Atlantic Ocean. It's a key migratory pathway for whales and other endangered species.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Ottawa extended an oil and gas exploration licence granted to Corridor Resources Inc. of Halifax, keeping alive the possibility that the Gulf could be opened up to offshore drilling.\n\nOf course, the deaths of 10 right whales in recent weeks can't be blamed on oil and gas exploration that hasn't yet happened. Scientists aren't sure why so many of the whales have been found dead, but it appears that some were hit by ships and others were tangled up in fishing gear.\n\nThere are only about 525 of these whales in the entire world, so finding 10 of them dead in such a short period has set off alarms for those who care about the species' survival.\n\nLeBlanc promises to gather more information and his department has already taken steps to minimize the chance that fishing boats will collide with whales. It is also asking ship operators to reduce the speed of their vessels in parts of the Gulf where whales are frequently sighted, and may reroute shipping lanes away from their feeding grounds.\n\nThose are all positive steps to minimize losses among a vulnerable population of animals that can grow up to 18 metres long. A similar program to save right whales in the Bay of Fundy successfully reduced deaths there a number of years ago.\n\nAt the same time, though, Ottawa is easing the way as pressure builds to open the Gulf to oil and gas exploration - a move that would disrupt marine life of all kinds and inevitably lead to more shipping activity, further putting the whales at risk.\n\nThis is a very bad idea. The Gulf of St. Lawrence is the world's biggest estuary, touching on five provinces and providing habitat for some 2,000 marine species.\n\nIt's a semi-enclosed area, meaning the damage from any spill would not easily dissipate, fouling the water and shores for years on end. That would be a disaster for lucrative lobster, crab and other fisheries, and for the region's tourism industry.\n\nAnd even short of a spill, the seismic method used to explore for oil and gas carries its own risks. It would involve sending sound waves into layers of underwater rock to determine the best spot for drilling. Scientists warn that can seriously disrupt fish and marine mammals.\n\nThe Harper government opened the door for possible offshore drilling in the Gulf in its 2012 budget, which included a measure that underlined the area's energy potential and made it easier for oil companies to explore for petroleum resources.\n\nThe Trudeau government has let the process continue by permitting exploration in most of the new marine protection area and allowing a federal-provincial regulator, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, to extend the exploration licence for Coastal Resources for a further four years.\n\nIt's not clear when or if actual exploration might start, but the potential is there: the federal government estimates the Gulf basin contains as much as 39 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.5 billion barrels of oil.\n\nOttawa should put an end to this. It should follow the example of Quebec, which recently cancelled plans for oil and gas exploration on Anticosti Island in the Gulf.\n\nIt's all very well for LeBlanc to talk about protecting right whales from immediate harm. It would be far more effective to remove the possibility of inflicting permanent damage on the ecosystem they depend on for their very existence.", "timeCrawl": "21:34:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-07", "id": "7859280", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "id": 38, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "id": 90, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "id": 649, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

whale, and followed it for four hours until they tracked a couple of them down.\n\nA research vessel in the Bering Sea spotted two critically endangered North Pacific right whales recently, an animal so rare that researchers can go years without seeing them. The vessel photographed two of the whales over the weekend and even got a biopsy sample from one of them, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced.\n\nResearchers on the Yushin Maru 2 spotted the whales as they participated in the Pacific Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research program, and used an acoustic recorder to find the faint calls of a right whale east of Bristol Bay in Alaska. The calls were between 10 and 32 miles away, prompting the ship to head toward them.\n\nFour and a half hours later, they were able to spot the elusive creatures.\n\nHere is what NOAA says about these rare animals on their website.\n\nWith as few as 400 remaining, NOAA Fisheries is dedicated to the conservation and recovery of North Atlantic right whales. Right whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Their two greatest threats are entanglement in fixed fishing gear and vessel strikes.\n\nEach fall, right whales travel more than 1,000 miles from their feeding grounds off Canada and New England to the warm coastal waters of South Carolina, Georgia and northeastern Florida. These southern waters are the only known calving area for the species; an area where they give birth and nurse their young.\n\nInteractive map of North Atlantic right whale sightings contributed to the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. Click on the whale tail icon for more information on each sighting. Use the + and - to zoom in and out. When using this map to view current sightings please keep in mind:\n\nBecause whales swim continuously, exact locations are obsolete within minutes of a sighting.\n\nA specific date or date range may contain few or no sightings. This does not mean right whales were not present. The majority of the North Atlantic right whale population lives along the U.S. eastern seaboard for much of the year, but effort to find them is typically limited to seasonal whale watches or researchers dedicated to locating seasonal habitats. The whereabouts of most of the individuals in the population is unknown for much of the year.\n\nRight whales are likely to be present within Seasonal and Dynamic Management Areas even if no sightings are illustrated.\n\nMariners are urged to use caution and proceed at safe speeds in areas where right whales occur. U.S. Law (50CF 224.105) prohibits operating vessels 65 feet (19.8 meters) or greater in excess of 10 knots in Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs) along the U.S. east coast. Mariners are also requested to route around voluntary speed reduction zones (Dynamic Management Areas -- DMAs) or transit through them at 10 knots or less. Approaching right whales closer than 500 yards is a violation of federal and state law. Please report all right whale sightings from Virginia to Maine to 866-755-6622, and from Florida to North Carolina to 877-WHALE-HELP. Right whale sightings in any location may also be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard via channel 16 or through the WhaleAlert iPhone/iPad app.", "timeCrawl": "23:14:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8717409", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "id": 616, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

For the past few weeks, at least 50 to 75 humpback whales have been gorging on krill and anchovies in the Monterey Bay, delighting boaters and whale-watching groups.\n\nTheir feeding frenzy is often visible from shore, from Monterey to Santa Cruz, at hot spots such as Aptos' Seacliff State Beach and Marina Beach, as well as the Santa Cruz, Monterey and Moss Landing harbors.\n\nRio del Mar resident Rachel Birns said she's seen humpbacks from her deck overlooking Beer Can Beach every day since July.\n\n\"Every day, I'm like, are they going to leave? And every day they're still here,\" said Birns, who said she checks for them every morning.\n\n\"You just keep looking and you'll see one. You'll see a blow and then sometimes they're breaching. Like, I just had a late lunch and my husband goes, 'They're breaching,' so I ran outside,\" she said.\n\nSanta Cruz resident and retiree Steve Lawson kayaks the waters between Capitola and Santa Cruz about five days a week.\n\n\"What can I say, it's consistent,\" said Lawson. \"That is, I'm generally seeing one or two whales a day.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, he saw a humpback with a distinctive curled dorsal fin, which some call \"Captain Hook,\" a quarter mile offshore Santa Cruz's Main Beach, where he sometimes sees humpbacks feed. He also often sees humpbacks feeding near Live Oak's Corcoran Lagoon and Moran Lake, he said.\n\nThe humpbacks near shore are following their food: anchovies, said Kate Cummings, naturalist and captain at Blue Ocean Whale Watching, a Moss Landing-based company.\n\n\"It's not unusual, just very awesome,\" Cummings said in an email to the Sentinel.\n\n\"Humpback whales are in the Monterey Bay throughout the spring, summer and fall to feed, but their proximity to shore makes their presence more obvious to people,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nJim Harvey, director of the Moss Landing Marine Labs, said around June or July is when humpbacks switch their diet, from krill to anchovies.\n\n\"This is pretty standard fare for this time of year,\" Harvey said. \"We usually get a fair amount of whale activity early, as in April, May, June -- mostly concentrating (feeding) on krill.\"\n\nThe krill draws both humpback and blue whales.\n\nAs the season progresses and the krill are \"mowed down,\" the humpbacks switch to anchovies and sardines, which brings the whales closer to shore, Harvey said.\n\nHumpback whales have become a common sight in the Monterey Bay from May to November. What's more rare are the blue, minke and fin whales that have been spotted in deeper waters in recent weeks, said Nancy Black, captain and owner of Monterey Bay Whale Watch, a Monterey Harbor-based company.\n\nStrong northwest winds this spring and early summer have created perfect conditions for krill, since winds generate an upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean's depths. About a week ago, the winds stopped and the waters calmed. The krill have begun to accumulate, and so have the whales, Black said.\n\n\"We're seeing blue whales on our trips every day in Monterey. They're in the bay, on the edge of the canyon, scattered wide. Most of the whale watching trips are seeing blue whales on most of the trips now, because they're fairly numerous (there),\" Black said.\n\nBlue whales are endangered, and tourists fly from all over to the Monterey Bay hoping to see them, Black said.\n\nShe has seen fin whales -- the second largest whale, next to the blue whale -- as well as the much smaller minke whales in the Monterey Bay recently. And on Sunday, she thinks she saw a sei whale, which is the third largest whale, around 20 miles offshore.\n\n\"The diversity right now is pretty amazing, to have a chance to see at least three different species of large whales,\" Black said. \"I wouldn't say you're going to see all three for sure on your trip, but they're out there and conditions are great right now.\"", "timeCrawl": "13:30:00", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moss Landing, California"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8406100", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

bitter Armageddon jokes.\n\nDisbelief turned to deep concern and then faded to a sense of futility as Canadian politicians attempted to make sense of Donald Trump's tweet-war with North Korea this week.\n\nThe nuclear antagonism, punctuated by vicious and public Republican bickering that filled the American airwaves, was a stark reminder to the many Canadian officials engaged on the NAFTA file that Ottawa's sharp focus on the trade talks starting Wednesday is not shared by the White House.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of high-stakes Twitter, Canadian politics were notable this week for action on whales, border crossers, and private heath care.\n\nHere are three ways politics touched us recently:\n\nWHALE-WATCHING\n\nThere are only about 500 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and 10 of them have been found dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the past two months, alarming conservationists, the fishing industry and the federal government.\n\nSo on Friday, Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Transport Minister Marc Garneau announced some interim measures aimed at protecting the 18-metre-long mammals - even though no one knows for sure why they are dying in this particular area.\n\nSince they seem to be dying of blunt trauma from swimming into boats, ships are now having to cut their speed as they pass through part of the Gulf, until the whales' migration is finished.\n\nAnd because the whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear, the government has also shut down parts of the snow crab fishery and restricted other types of fishing.\n\nThe story is not over. Researchers are still looking into why and how so many whales are dying, and there may be more protective steps to come.\n\nEnvironmentalists want the government to take a closer look at oil and gas activity in the area, to see if the whales' habitat or stamina is being hurt.\n\nBORDER-WATCHING\n\nWith hundreds of migrants crossing illegally into Quebec over the past few weeks and straining provincial resources for processing and accommodation, the federal government has subtly changed its tone - and now its policy approach - in how it deals with the border-crossers.\n\nThe government has decided to dedicate 20 extra officials to focusing solely on handling their applications for asylum, hoping to take care of the paperwork before camping out at Olympic Stadium in the summer turns into desperation in winter.\n\nThere is mounting pressure on the federal government to ensure that a relatively welcoming atmosphere in Montreal does not turn sour.\n\nPremier Philippe Couillard lashed out this week at political opponent Francois Legault, leader of the Coalition Avenir Quebec, for stirring up negative sentiment around the asylum seekers.\n\nPRIVATE CLINIC-WATCHING\n\nFederal Health Minister Jane Philpott is eyeing yet another province for its flirtations with private health care.\n\nOver the past year, she has taken on Quebec for its user fees and Saskatchewan for its private MRI scans.\n\nNow, the federal government is working with the provincial government in British Columbia to look at extra-billing practices at three clinics.\n\nThe Canada Health Act prohibits extra billing for services that are considered medically necessary. Provinces risk having some of their federal health transfers clawed back if they contravene the act.\n\nDriving the crackdown is a concern that private health care will disadvantage those who don't have extra money to pay for the care they need.", "timeCrawl": "21:01:00", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 65, "amb": false, "textEnd": 80}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8700729", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It's an important step. But temporary measures such as these are not enough to reverse the decline of these whales.\n\nWe need to ensure permanent, meaningful protections for the vital habitat of North Atlantic right whales and other vulnerable marine wildlife. The government is planning to create a marine protected area (MPA) around the Laurentian Channel, where North Atlantic right whales are known to frequent. But proposed regulations will still allow oil and gas drilling and seismic blasts in 80 per cent of the MPA. These activities threaten whales and other wildlife. An oil spill would be even more devastating.\n\nWe also need to understand why ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement have contributed to the sharp spike in whales deaths this year, with at least 12 having perished from a population estimated to number only about 500. For example, lack of sufficient food or poisoning from ingesting toxic substances in the ocean risk leaving the whales diminished, disoriented and less able to avoid dangerous ships and harmful fishing gear. We need a better understanding to take more appropriate measures based on the best available science.\"\n\nAbout World Wildlife Fund Canada\n\nWWF-Canada creates solutions to the environmental challenges that matter most for Canadians. We work in places that are unique and ecologically important, so that nature, wildlife and people thrive together. Because we are all wildlife.

nothing left to do except crack bitter Armageddon jokes.\n\nDisbelief turned to deep concern and then faded to a sense of futility as Canadian politicians attempted to make sense of Donald Trump's tweet-war with North Korea this week.\n\nThe nuclear antagonism, punctuated by vicious and public Republican bickering that filled the American airwaves, was a stark reminder to the many Canadian officials engaged on the NAFTA file that Ottawa's sharp focus on the trade talks starting Wednesday is not shared by the White House.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of high-stakes Twitter, Canadian politics were notable this week for action on whales, border crossers, and private heath care.\n\nHere are three ways politics touched us recently:\n\nWHALE-WATCHING\n\nThere are only about 500 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and 10 of them have been found dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the past two months, alarming conservationists, the fishing industry and the federal government.\n\nSo on Friday, Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Transport Minister Marc Garneau announced some interim measures aimed at protecting the 18-metre-long mammals -- even though no one knows for sure why they are dying in this particular area.\n\nSince they seem to be dying of blunt trauma from swimming into boats, ships are now having to cut their speed as they pass through part of the Gulf, until the whales' migration is finished.\n\nAnd because the whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear, the government has also shut down parts of the snow crab fishery and restricted other types of fishing.\n\nThe story is not over. Researchers are still looking into why and how so many whales are dying, and there may be more protective steps to come.\n\nEnvironmentalists want the government to take a closer look at oil and gas activity in the area, to see if the whales' habitat or stamina is being hurt.\n\nBORDER-WATCHING\n\nWith hundreds of migrants crossing illegally into Quebec over the past few weeks and straining provincial resources for processing and accommodation, the federal government has subtly changed its tone -- and now its policy approach -- in how it deals with the border-crossers.\n\nThe government has decided to dedicate 20 extra officials to focusing solely on handling their applications for asylum, hoping to take care of the paperwork before camping out at Olympic Stadium in the summer turns into desperation in winter.\n\nThere is mounting pressure on the federal government to ensure that a relatively welcoming atmosphere in Montreal does not turn sour.\n\nPremier Philippe Couillard lashed out this week at political opponent Francois Legault, leader of the Coalition Avenir Quebec, for stirring up negative sentiment around the asylum seekers.\n\nPRIVATE CLINIC-WATCHING\n\nFederal Health Minister Jane Philpott is eyeing yet another province for its flirtations with private health care.\n\nOver the past year, she has taken on Quebec for its user fees and Saskatchewan for its private MRI scans.\n\nNow, the federal government is working with the provincial government in British Columbia to look at extra-billing practices at three clinics.\n\nThe Canada Health Act prohibits extra billing for services that are considered medically necessary.

as Canadian politicians attempted to make sense of Donald Trump's tweet-war with North Korea this week.\n\nThe nuclear antagonism, punctuated by vicious and public Republican bickering that filled the American airwaves, was a stark reminder to the many Canadian officials engaged on the NAFTA file that Ottawa's sharp focus on the trade talks starting Wednesday is not shared by the White House.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of high-stakes Twitter, Canadian politics were notable this week for action on whales, border crossers, and private heath care.\n\nHere are three ways politics touched us recently:\n\nWHALE-WATCHING\n\nThere are only about 500 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and 10 of them have been found dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the past two months, alarming conservationists, the fishing industry and the federal government.\n\nSo on Friday, Fisheries Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Transport Minister Marc Garneau announced some interim measures aimed at protecting the 18-metre-long mammals -- even though no one knows for sure why they are dying in this particular area.\n\nSince they seem to be dying of blunt trauma from swimming into boats, ships are now having to cut their speed as they pass through part of the Gulf, until the whales' migration is finished.\n\nAnd because the whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear, the government has also shut down parts of the snow crab fishery and restricted other types of fishing.\n\nThe story is not over. Researchers are still looking into why and how so many whales are dying, and there may be more protective steps to come.\n\nEnvironmentalists want the government to take a closer look at oil and gas activity in the area, to see if the whales' habitat or stamina is being hurt.\n\nBORDER-WATCHING\n\nWith hundreds of migrants crossing illegally into Quebec over the past few weeks and straining provincial resources for processing and accommodation, the federal government has subtly changed its tone -- and now its policy approach -- in how it deals with the border-crossers.\n\nThe government has decided to dedicate 20 extra officials to focusing solely on handling their applications for asylum, hoping to take care of the paperwork before camping out at Olympic Stadium in the summer turns into desperation in winter.\n\nThere is mounting pressure on the federal government to ensure that a relatively welcoming atmosphere in Montreal does not turn sour.\n\nPremier Philippe Couillard lashed out this week at political opponent Francois Legault, leader of the Coalition Avenir Quebec, for stirring up negative sentiment around the asylum seekers.\n\nPRIVATE CLINIC-WATCHING\n\nFederal Health Minister Jane Philpott is eyeing yet another province for its flirtations with private health care.\n\nOver the past year, she has taken on Quebec for its user fees and Saskatchewan for its private MRI scans.\n\nNow, the federal government is working with the provincial government in British Columbia to look at extra-billing practices at three clinics.\n\nThe Canada Health Act prohibits extra billing for services that are considered medically necessary. Provinces risk having some of their federal health transfers clawed back if they contravene the act.\n\nDriving the crackdown is a concern that private health care will disadvantage those who don't have extra money to pay for the care they need.", "timeCrawl": "20:40:00", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8697734", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

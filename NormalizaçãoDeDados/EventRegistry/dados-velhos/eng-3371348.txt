A third of the victims are children. Many of the victims were too mangled and decomposed to be identified.\n\nThousands have lost their homes in impoverished, low-lying areas of Freetown and surrounding communities.\n\nWith more rain forecast for the coming week, further mudslides are possible. The Office of National Security said a crack has opened on the side of a mountain where residents were told to evacuate.\n\nThe main focus is getting people away from areas still under threat, Zuliatu Cooper, the deputy minister of health and sanitation, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The rains are still pending and there is a possibility that we will have another incident,\" he said. \"We would rather have structures falling down without people in them.\"\n\nThe mudslides tore apart multistory concrete homes, with their metal reinforcements tangled like threads. On the same hillsides that were stripped bare, fully intact homes stood nearby, with untouched, lush vegetation.\n\nWorkers searching for bodies picked their way through the debris that included the remnants of daily lives: stools, abandoned shoes.\n\nGrieving survivors said they were haunted by thoughts of dead relatives.\n\n\"Last night, I could not sleep,\" said Tenneh Bull, who lost a daughter. \"Even now I'm still thinking of her; thoughts of her death is lingering.\"\n\nSierra Leone has pleaded for international assistance, while Amnesty International issued a statement accusing the government of failing to learn from similar incidents.\n\n\"Due to a lack of regulation and insufficient consideration for minimum standards and environmental laws, millions of Sierra Leoneans are living in dangerously vulnerable homes,\" said Makmid Kamara, the group's deputy director of global issues.\n\nMany poor areas around Freetown are near sea level and lack good drainage systems, which makes flooding worse during the rainy season. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction in hilltop areas. Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is another leading contributor to flooding and mudslides.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9751176", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Threat looms of more mudslides in Sierra Leone amid mass burial - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60108991/60108991.jpg?875331", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "204", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Freetown"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "77013", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown", "label": {"eng": "Freetown"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Health"}, "id": "302504", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "302660", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "id": "303240", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flood"}, "id": "303248", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "id": "304754", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pathology"}, "id": "304855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concrete"}, "id": "305900", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vegetation"}, "id": "306740", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mudslide"}, "id": "306777", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudslide"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}, "id": "306866", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wet season"}, "id": "306936", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "id": "306965", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}, "id": "312271", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}, "id": "314599", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Debris"}, "id": "318622", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris"}, {"label": {"eng": "Johnny Paul Koroma"}, "id": "477496", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Paul_Koroma"}, {"label": {"eng": "West African Ebola virus epidemic"}, "id": "1273410", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 933, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1182, "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards"}], "time": "18:14:00"}

Workers struggled in the thick mud and debris of smashed homes looking for more bodies, picking their way through stools, shoes and other remnants of daily life.\n\nThe government hired 600 gravediggers for individual burials taking place in a cemetery that already holds victims of the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak which killed thousands in the West African nation.\n\n\"We all share the agony which has befallen the nation,\" President Ernest Bai Koroma told mourners at the cemetery.\n\n\"They had their hopes and aspirations, a bright future -- like the six innocent children who went to study in the home of one of their brightest colleagues, like the young man who was due to get married tomorrow, like the husband who has worked so hard to get his family a new home and had just moved them to this new and lovely home,\" he said.\n\nDr. Owiss Koroma, the government's chief pathologist, said the confirmed death toll from the mudslide and flooding was at least 350, a third of them children. The bodies of many victims were too mangled and decomposed to be identified.\n\n\"I lost my sister and mother. The water took away my mother and sister and they have buried them today. That's why we are here, to mourn and go back home,\" said Zainab Kargbo, who was among those at the cemetery.\n\nThousands lost their homes in poor, low-lying areas of Freetown and surrounding communities.\n\nWith more rain forecast for the coming week, further mudslides were a threat. The Office of National Security warned people of the danger from the newly opened crack on the side of a mountain and urged residents to evacuate.\n\nThe main focus is getting people away from areas still under threat, Zuliatu Cooper, the deputy minister of health and sanitation, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The rains are still pending and there is a possibility that we will have another incident,\" he said. \"We would rather have structures falling down without people in them.\"\n\nThe mudslides tore apart multistory concrete homes, leaving their metal reinforcements tangled like threads.

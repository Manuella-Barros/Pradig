Bianca was the first guesser, but she was eliminated when she incorrectly guessed that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker. Bianca was revealed to be journalist and broadcaster Robin Roberts' niece.\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 has 11 mystery celebrity relative contestants competing for the $100,000 grand prize, and there have been some incredible reveals so far. Hosted by Kevin and Franklin Jonas, Claim to Fame seasons 1 and 2 had some very exciting competitors. They included relatives of actors, singers, athletes, and politicians.\n\nClaim to Fame season 1 featured winner Loreal Chanel Palmer, known as L.C. on the show, who was revealed to be Keke Palmer's sister, and runner-up Logan Crosby, who's Jason Aldean's cousin. Claim to Fame season 2 starred winner Gabriel Cannon, Nick Cannon's brother, and runner-up Jerrica Monay Brooks, who was known as Monay on the show, who was J.B. Smoove's daughter. Claim to Fame season 3 also has had some shocking reveals.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nBianca Is Robin Roberts' Niece\n\nBianca Was Chosen To Be The First Guesser\n\nDuring Claim to Fame season 3 episode 1, Bianca was revealed to be Bianca Roberts, the niece of Peabody Award-winning journalist and broadcaster, Robin Roberts. During the Claim to Fame season 3 Two Truths and a Lie game, Bianca revealed that her celebrity relative had won a Peabody Award. Her fellow contestants didn't know what a Peabody Award was. The award is given for excellence in broadcasting. In a Claim to Fame Instagram post, her other two statements were that her relative was her aunt and an actress. The actress part was the lie.\n\nAfter the Claim to Fame season 3 talent show, in which Bianca danced with a gymnastics ribbon and painted a picture, she and her fellow contestant Miguel placed last, while Gracie Lou won. This meant that either Bianca or Miguel would be the guesser. Bianca thought that she had enough votes to avoid becoming the guesser, but Miguel worked hard to convince his fellow competitors to vote for her instead of him. When Bianca was chosen, she incorrectly guessed that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker, so she was eliminated.\n\nWhen Robin was revealed to Bianca's celebrity relative, Bianca explained that she's her youngest auntie. She said that she loves her and she's amazing. Bianca added that Robin has fought through so many trials and tribulations, and she's out there still fighting. Bianca admitted that she never in a million years imagined that she'd be the first one out of the competition, but she thought that her aunt Robin would be super proud of her.\n\nRelated\n\nClaim To Fame Season 3 Promo Teases Contestant Whose Identity Has Already Been Spoiled By Fans\n\nThe identities of the Claim to Fame season 3 contestants are top secret, but some fans already know who one of the celebrity relatives is.\n\nWho's Still Competing On Claim To Fame Season 3?\n\nThere Are 10 Celebrity Relatives Left In The Competition\n\nThere are ten contestants left in Claim to Fame season 3. They include Adam, Danny, Dedrick, Gracie Lou, Hud, Jill, Mackenzie, Miguel, Naomi, and Shane. It'll be very exciting to see which celebrity relative is revealed next, either through a correct or incorrect guess.\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 already has a major twist because the Clue Wall isn't constantly available to the contestants. In episode 1, it was locked, and the competitors could only view it after Franklin unlocked it. It's going to be thrilling to see what else Claim to Fame season 3 has in store for its contestants viewers. It's already shaping up to be the best season yet.\n\nClaim to Fame airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\n\nSource: Claim to Fame/Instagram, Claim to Fame/Instagram\n\nClaim To Fame\n\nClaim to Fame is a reality television competition series that brings together lesser-known celebrity relatives.

When that guess was wrong, it was revealed that Bianca is the niece of Good Morning America's host Robin Roberts.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_huff@fresnobee.com", "name": "Matthew Huff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherlock Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peabody Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forest Whitaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/tjjuw6/picture289952604/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2f6ab893-c2c1-4b12-9b88-abe77367f78c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723224", "eventUri": "eng-9723224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Very quickly, alliances began to form between the 11 contestants as they tried to suss each other out, and when Bianca and Miguel found themselves in the bottom two and in the vote for the night's guesser, tensions got even higher.\n\nBianca was one of the few to form a guess about a fellow contestant's celebrity relative's identity, drawing an early conclusion that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker due to his looks and certain information from the Clue Wall. Miguel, on the other hand, had no idea of anyone's relative and instead ran (literally ran) throughout the house begging for supporters to vote Bianca in instead of him.\n\nMiguel's strategy worked, and, unfortunately, Bianca's guess about Shane was incorrect, sending her home first. Her exit as the first eliminee was a lot more graceful than what we saw last season, but when TV Insider caught up with Bianca, she revealed why she sympathizes with Carly Reeves now.\n\nWhat drew you to Claim to Fame?\n\nBianca Roberts: Well, I got an invitation on Instagram from someone who was just saying, \"Hey, would you be interested in being on a reality show?\" And I thought it was a joke. I thought it was some kind of scam at first, and then they told me to go check out Claim to Fame and see what I thought about it. And when I saw it, and I realized it wasn't like some cheesy dating show or anything like that, I was like, \"Yeah, I would definitely be interested in doing this.\"\n\nWhen you played the game, you showed some journalism chops, even though your background is real estate. Did you think that might give away your celebrity relative?\n\nI didn't think so at all. I went into it just thinking no one is going to figure out who I'm related to. There's like no way.\n\nDid you have any clue about Gracie Lou's identity? I know you two were close.\n\nRelated\n\nExplore the 'Claim to Fame' Season 3 Clue Wall\n\nI didn't have any clue. And we were really close. That's the first one that it was like, \"She's my BFF.\" And I had no idea, none at all.\n\nWere you surprised that Miguel's Hail Mary to win over voters worked? And what was your reaction to how emotional he was?\n\nYou know what? I wasn't surprised, and that should have been my strategy, looking back on it, to really kind of push for, \"Please, you know, keep me on the show,\" that kind of thing. But I'm such a laid-back person, and I'm very just go with the flow, and I was like, whatever will be, will be. I'm not going to grovel and do all of that. And if it meant that much to him, that's the way it needed to play out.\n\nHow confident did you feel when you were going into your guess-off against Shane?\n\nOh, I wasn't confident at all. I knew I was just throwing something against the wall. I mean, the previous [season] where Tom Hanks' niece had a total meltdown and freaked out, was like, \"I was only here for three days!\" I could totally see why she would have reacted that way because at that point, there's really no information on anyone, so anyone could have just guessed anything. There's not enough time to figure out clues. There's not enough information provided for you to know anything. So I knew I was just throwing a Hail Mary.\n\nDisney/Chris Willard\n\nDo you think that since you had talked about your theory that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker, he might've heard about that and encouraged the vote for you to be the guesser?\n\nProbably. I mean, I would think that would be a smart move on his part, if he was like, \"Oh yeah, let's go ahead and make her guess because I know she's totally off base.\" But again, when I look back on it, I just know that anyone could have been up there, and whoever was up there would have guessed wrong because there was no information on anyone.\n\nLast season, the contestants formed a group chat after filming. Is that the case with the Season 3 cast?\n\nAbsolutely, we're all besties. We all have a group chat. We're like talking about everything all day. We are super excited for the premiere. Can't wait.\n\nLastly, since your time was limited on this season, is there anything you want people to know that maybe didn't come through on screen?\n\nI want people to know -- I don't know how it comes across, because I haven't seen it myself, any edits or anything, so I really don't know how it played off -- that if I seem like closed-off and dry or boring, I'm really not like that in real life. If I come off like, \"Man, she barely said two words,\" I just want them to know that's not like who I actually am. And there was a point there that I had fallen in the background and broke one of my nails, and it was bleeding, so I was out of some of the time of filming for a little bit while I got treated.

THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FROM CLAIM TO FAME SEASON 3!\n\nSummary\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 contestant Naomi's clues point to actress Molly Ringwald being her cousin. References to the Brat Back and the Breakfast Club indicate that Naomi might be related to Molly. Naomi's relative won a Young Artist Award just like Molly did in 1985.\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 contestant Naomi is hiding her identity from her fellow competitors, but a clue from the Wine Room pulled by Gracie Lou might help them figure out who she is. Hosted by Kevin and Franklin Jonas, Claim to Fame season 3 features 11 celebrity relatives competing for a $100,000 grand prize. With new twists, including a more challenging talent show which required the contestants to perform three talents instead of one and a locked Clue Wall, the game is as challenging as ever.\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 revealed the identity of Bianca in episode 1. She's Peabody Award-winning journalist and broadcaster Robin Roberts' niece. As the season progresses, it'll be exciting to see if Gracie Lou and her fellow contestants will be able to completely decipher Naomi's clue. Here are the clues that prove who Naomi's celebrity relative is.\n\nRelated\n\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\n\nNaomi's Claim To Fame Season 2 Clues\n\nNaomi's Wine Room Clue Gave Away Some Crucial Information\n\nDuring the Claim to Fame season 3 premiere, the contestants played the traditional Two Truths and a Lie game. Naomi was only shown sharing that her celebrity relative had won a Young Artist Award, but a Claim to Fame Instagram post revealed that Naomi's relative is her cousin and a singer. The singer statement appears to be the lie. During the Claim to Fame talent show, Naomi hula-hooped and sang a beautiful rendition of \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\nWhen Gracie Lou won the talent show, she earned the privilege of choosing someone's clue from the Wine Room. She picked Naomi, whose rebus puzzle clue included a bra, the letter T, a backpack, a crown, the \"in\" symbol, a club, and four coffees and croissants. Gracie Lou figured out that the first part of the clue spelled, \"Brat Pack,\" but she wasn't sure about the rest. A closer look reveals that the clue states, \"Brat Pack Princess In Club Breakfast.\" In addition, two contestants also noticed bacon and eggs on the clue wall, which they thought might refer to the Breakfast Club.\n\nRelated\n\nClaim To Fame Season 3 Promo Teases Contestant Whose Identity Has Already Been Spoiled By Fans\n\nThe identities of the Claim to Fame season 3 contestants are top secret, but some fans already know who one of the celebrity relatives is.\n\nNaomi Is Most Likely Actress Molly Ringwald's Cousin\n\nThe Clues Point In Molly's Direction\n\nAlthough nothing has been confirmed, Naomi's Claim to Fame clues seem to indicate that her cousin is actress Molly Ringwald. During the 1980s, a group of young actors who appeared in coming-of-age films together were known as the Brat Pack. They included Molly, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, and Judd Nelson.\n\nMolly starred in The Breakfast Club in 1985, playing Claire Standish, who was known as the princess of the group. Molly also won the 1985 Young Artist Award for Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical, Comedy, Adventure or Drama for her role as Samantha \"Sam\" Baker in Sixteen Candles. All of these things are referred to in Naomi's clues.\n\nTime will tell if Naomi is related to Molly, but the clues seem to point in her direction. Since many of the Claim to Fame cast members are on the younger side, it'll be intriguing to see if any of them can piece together her 1980s clues in order to figure out who she is. Claim to Fame season 3 is already a roller coaster, and it's certain to be a wild ride for the rest of the season.\n\nClaim to Fame season 3 airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\n\nSource: Claim to Fame/Instagram\n\nClaim To Fame\n\nClaim to Fame is a reality television competition series that brings together lesser-known celebrity relatives.

Very quickly, alliances began to form between the 11 contestants as they tried to suss each other out, and when Bianca and Miguel found themselves in the bottom two and in the vote for the night's guesser, tensions got even higher.\n\nBianca was one of the few to form a guess about a fellow contestant's celebrity relative's identity, drawing an early conclusion that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker due to his looks and certain information from the Clue Wall. Miguel, on the other hand, had no idea of anyone's relative and instead ran (literally ran) throughout the house begging for supporters to vote Bianca in instead of him.\n\nMiguel's strategy worked, and, unfortunately, Bianca's guess about Shane was incorrect, sending her home first. Her exit as the first eliminee was a lot more graceful than what we saw last season, but when TV Insider caught up with Bianca, she revealed why she sympathizes with Carly Reeves now.\n\nWhat drew you to Claim to Fame?\n\nBianca Roberts: Well, I got an invitation on Instagram from someone who was just saying, \"Hey, would you be interested in being on a reality show?\" And I thought it was a joke. I thought it was some kind of scam at first, and then they told me to go check out Claim to Fame and see what I thought about it. And when I saw it, and I realized it wasn't like some cheesy dating show or anything like that, I was like, \"Yeah, I would definitely be interested in doing this.\"\n\nWhen you played the game, you showed some journalism chops, even though your background is real estate. Did you think that might give away your celebrity relative?\n\nI didn't think so at all. I went into it just thinking no one is going to figure out who I'm related to. There's like no way.\n\nDid you have any clue about Gracie Lou's identity? I know you two were close.\n\nI didn't have any clue. And we were really close. That's the first one that it was like, \"She's my BFF.\" And I had no idea, none at all.\n\nWere you surprised that Miguel's Hail Mary to win over voters worked? And what was your reaction to how emotional he was?\n\nYou know what? I wasn't surprised, and that should have been my strategy, looking back on it, to really kind of push for, \"Please, you know, keep me on the show,\" that kind of thing. But I'm such a laid-back person, and I'm very just go with the flow, and I was like, whatever will be, will be. I'm not going to grovel and do all of that. And if it meant that much to him, that's the way it needed to play out.\n\nHow confident did you feel when you were going into your guess-off against Shane?\n\nOh, I wasn't confident at all. I knew I was just throwing something against the wall. I mean, the previous [season] where Tom Hanks' niece had a total meltdown and freaked out, was like, \"I was only here for three days!\" I could totally see why she would have reacted that way because at that point, there's really no information on anyone, so anyone could have just guessed anything. There's not enough time to figure out clues. There's not enough information provided for you to know anything. So I knew I was just throwing a Hail Mary.\n\nDo you think that since you had talked about your theory that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker, he might've heard about that and encouraged the vote for you to be the guesser?\n\nProbably. I mean, I would think that would be a smart move on his part, if he was like, \"Oh yeah, let's go ahead and make her guess because I know she's totally off base.\" But again, when I look back on it, I just know that anyone could have been up there, and whoever was up there would have guessed wrong because there was no information on anyone.\n\nLast season, the contestants formed a group chat after filming. Is that the case with the Season 3 cast?\n\nAbsolutely, we're all besties. We all have a group chat. We're like talking about everything all day. We are super excited for the premiere. Can't wait.\n\nLastly, since your time was limited on this season, is there anything you want people to know that maybe didn't come through on screen?\n\nI want people to know -- I don't know how it comes across, because I haven't seen it myself, any edits or anything, so I really don't know how it played off -- that if I seem like closed-off and dry or boring, I'm really not like that in real life. If I come off like, \"Man, she barely said two words,\" I just want them to know that's not like who I actually am.

After a poor performance at the talent show, Bianca was forced to guess the celebrity relative of one of her competitors armed with nothing more than two truths and a lie, a few hours with the clue wall and vibes. She opted to guess that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker, but when that guess was revealed to be incorrect, she was forced to reveal that she is, in fact, Robin Roberts' niece. Bianca was sent home in Week 1.\n\nBianca is related to longtime Good Morning America host Robin Roberts.

In Season 1, Chuck Norris' grandson was sent packing in the premiere after producers realized he'd snuck a phone into the house. In Season 2, the niece of Tom Hanks threw a temper tantrum after being correctly identified by another contestant, screaming as she packed, \"I SHOULD HAVE MORE CAMERA TIME!\" Season 3's first player to be eliminated, Bianca, who turned out to be Good Morning America host Robin Roberts' niece, seemed to break the curse, exiting the show without prompting a scandal, and with a kind video message from her aunt.\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that she wouldn't have liked to run through the house screaming like last year's first evictee. \"Nobody has any information right up front, not that early,\" she told Parade in an exclusive interview after her exit. Deciding the first boot in Season 3 was a total crap shoot.\n\nAfter losing the talent show challenge, Bianca found herself in the bottom two up against Miguel. She was then voted to be the guesser by her fellow nepo babies and took a shot in the dark guessing that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker. When she was wrong, her relative was revealed and she was sent home.\n\nRelated: The 'Claim to Fame' Season 3 Cast, Their 'Two Truths and a Lie' and Our First Guesses About Their Identities\n\nHere's our full conversation with Bianca about her time on Claim to Fame:\n\nMatthew Huff: To start, how did you end up on Claim to Fame? How did you hear about the show and decide to go on?\n\nI got a message on Instagram, and someone asked me if I was interested in being on a reality show. I really thought it was a scam. They told me to check out the show and see if it was something I might be interested in. I watched it, and I was like, \"Totally.\"\n\nAt what point did you talk to your aunt about going on the show?\n\nDuring casting. They did say, \"You might want to reach out and ask your auntie if she's OK with it.\" And I told her about it. She was like, \"Go for it. Do it.\"\n\nWhat's your relationship with her like outside the show?\n\nI mean, she's just my aunt. When people find out that I'm related to her, they're like, \"Oh, do you really know her?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I have her phone number. I can call her anytime. I can text her. I don't have to be passed through anyone to be in contact with her.\" Monthly we get on a call as a family, and we all chat. I am her oldest niece, her first niece. So yeah, we've always had a really good relationship.\n\nWhat was your strategy coming into the house? Did you have any plans to throw people off and keep your identity a secret?\n\nMy plan was to be a mother figure. Maybe people would be like, \"Oh, she's kind of old, so maybe we could bond,\" and I could get information about them. As far as hiding my identity, I was just really confident that people would not put any anything together about who I was related to.\n\nRelated: Claim to Fame Producer Answers Our Behind-the-Scenes Questions (Exclusive)\n\nYou lost the talent show challenge in the premiere and that ended up sending you home. Did you think it was going poorly as it happened?\n\nI didn't think it was going poorly. I tried to make sure that there was one talent that I felt I did the best at and then I wasn't really worried about the other two talents. It was pretty shocking to me that it turned out the way it turned out.\n\nWhat were your three talents?\n\nI did a ribbon dance, a comedy sketch and then a little painting.\n\nGoing into the guess off, it looks like nobody in the house has any idea who anyone is. Was everyone completely in the dark?\n\nThat definitely was the vibe when I was there. I know previously people like Tom Hanks' niece had a big meltdown and was like, \"I've only been here for three days!\" I could see honestly having that reaction being the first to be eliminated. Nobody has any information right up front, not that early. Everyone was in the dark. It could have been anyone up there, and whoever was up there would have gone home.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Claim to Fame Season 2 (Including Who Won)\n\nThe clue wall opened up while you guys were in the house. How long did you have to look at that before the guess off?\n\nIf I remember, like a few hours.\n\nWere there any clues that you spotted that connected to your aunt?\n\nThe microphone.\n\nRelated: Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses! The First Images of the Claim to Fame Season 3 Cast and Clue Wall Just Dropped (Exclusive)\n\nIn this season, the cast included 11 people rather than 12 like the first two seasons. Was there any discussion in the house about there being fewer people?\n\nI just figured this was something the producers decided to do this time. I didn't think it was weird. I didn't think that there was any special reason why they did it that way, or that someone got sick.\n\nHave you talked to your aunt about what happened on the show?\n\nNo, I haven't told anybody what happened. Everyone is anxious to see the show.\n\nDo you have any plans for a watch party?\n\nI did have plans for a watch party, but since I am in Houston and Hurricane Beryl just came through. There's no power anywhere. I'm actually at my parents' house because they have a generator. It looks like our quote unquote \"watch party\" might be at their house, but most people don't have power.\n\nAre you and your family safe?\n\nYes! We're all safe. We're all good.\n\nNext, Everything You Need to Know About Claim to Fame Season 3", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_huff@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matthew Huff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forest Whitaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/68/668ea654-b0a9-5918-9bc4-4ea85463ecbf/668fbf4f4a312.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C3&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723224", "eventUri": "eng-9723224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

They spend the show trying to identify each other's family connections, with the last person standing (i.e., whoever evades recognition the longest) receiving a handsome prize of $100,000.\n\nSo, the stakes are high! And already Season 3 is proving to be a twisty ride. Here's a recap of every celebrity relative revealed on Claim to Fame Season 3, which premiered on July 10 -- plus, a look at some of the clues and rumors about who's next to be identified.\n\nBianca found herself on the chopping block in the Claim to Fame Season 3 premiere. She tried to save herself by guessing the celebrity relative of castmate Shane, theorizing that it was Forest Whitaker. However, this was incorrect -- and Bianca was sent home, but not before her own relative was revealed: Robin Roberts!\n\n\"You've always been something special,\" the Good Morning America anchor told her niece in a sweet, pre-recorded video message. \"But now, the fact that you're venturing outside of your comfort zone, staking your claim to fame -- who would have thought it? Your family thought it, because you have been the star of our family all along.\"\n\nAt the end of the premiere episode, the cast was having fun doing magic tricks when Dedrick chimed in with an apparent slip-up. \"I can't do that in front of my kids because they'll actually try it,\" he said. \"Problem is, I'll walk into the ER or something and they'll be like, 'For real Mr. Jackson? Again?'\"\n\nNow, revealing your surname is certainly a no-no on this show -- especially if you happen to share a surname with a famous musical family. (Two of Dedrick's clues said his relative was a big name in music.)\n\nDedrick's castmates noticed the apparent blunder, though it could certainly be a sneaky misdirect.\n\nFans on Reddit began speculating even before Season 3 premiered, and they have some compelling leads. Several have theorized, for example, that Miguel is actually Raphael, the nephew of Jamie Lee Curtis, and that Dedrick is indeed a Jackson -- Siggy Jackson, to be exact, son to Jackie Jackson and nephew to Michael Jackson.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Jonas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Jonas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forest Whitaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lee_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lee Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ER (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/10/30fce3cd/172911_1698.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723224", "eventUri": "eng-9723224", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1028, "textEnd": 1035}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

However, they can only win if they can avoid disclosing what famous person's name they drop whenever the spirit moves them.\n\nAmong the sneaky contestants is Jill, determined to keep her ties to fame a secret for as long as possible. So far, she's doing a great job, as many have no idea who her relative could be after seeing her clues. Let's put our thinking caps on and guess who Jill's famous family member could be!\n\nWhile we won't know who Jill's celebrity relative is until Claim to Fame Season 3 begins, she gives fans clues about who they might be. In her Claim to Fame profile, Jill spilled some tea by naming two truths -- and a lie -- about the celebrity.\n\nAs for which of Jill's clues are real or fake, that has yet to be determined. But after seeing her post and clues on social media, fans have many theories of who the relative could be. However, it's important to note that the guesses are all over the place!\n\nThen there's Robin Williams, a comedian and actor known for his iconic roles in Mrs. Doubtfire, Dead Poet's Society, and Aladdin. Before Robin died by suicide in 2014, he also earned multiple awards, including a Best Supporting Actor win for his role in Good Will Hunting.\n\nClint Eastwood was also popular among fans after Jill's clue. Like the other guesses, Clint has been in the acting biz for decades and has collected awards along the way, including several Oscars, which some would feel beats a People's Choice Award.

Claim to Fame returned to ABC for its third season on Wednesday, introducing viewers to a fresh crop of duplicitous celebrity relatives.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, the premiere kicked off with a game of Two Truths and a Lie, giving the contestants a chance to reveal a little bit about themselves to the other players -- and a lot about themselves to the audience at home. For example, only we know that \"Miguel\" is lying about his name to appear more Spanish, and that Gracie Lou is determined to trick everyone into believing that she descends from country music royalty. Let the mind games begin!\n\nKevin and Frankie -- sorry, Franklin -- Jonas also required the contestants to participate in a talent show, though we've never used the word \"talent\" more loosely in our lives.\n\nWhen the season's dramatic first elimination ceremony arrived, poor Bianca was forced to guess a housemate's celebrity relative with only a handful of unhelpful clues, so no one was surprised when she also became the first player to leave the house.

Each of the eleven contestants are relatives of famous people, and the idea is to keeping fellow housemates from guessing who that relative is for as long as possible.\n\nAs the Jonases talk to the contestants on the first day, the guessing game starts immediately, as each contestant gives \"two truths and a lie\" about the celebrity that they're connected to. The house has lots of clues, including the now-infamous \"Clue Wall\"; this season, however, the wall is locked in a display the first couple of nights.\n\nThe first challenge is now a Claim To Fame tradition: A talent show. This time around, each contestant has to present three talents, with ideas generated by props that are displayed backstage. The winner of the talent show, which is judged by all of the contestants, wins immunity and a choice of which person to get a clue about from the villa's \"Wine Cellar\" (the clues are in bottles with each person's name on them).\n\nThe bottom two contestants are subject to becoming that week's guesser through a vote in the \"Voteo Booth\" (this show loves naming things). The person that is voted the guesser picks someone from the cast and guesses who they are related to. If they're right, that person goes home. If they're wrong, the guesser's famous relative is revealed and they go home.\n\nWhat Shows Will It Remind You Of? Before Season 1, we said Claim To Fame crosses The Bachelor franchise with The Masked Singer, and that seems to still be true.\n\nOur Take: The formula for Season 3 of Claim To Fame has been tweaked a bit, but has pretty much stayed the same as it was in the first season. We no longer get to find out who the relative of one of the contestants is; during the first episode, each and every one of the contestants' famous relatives remained a mystery until the very end. The challenges are tweaked, too, but just for entertainment purposes.\n\nWhat we notice is that there are generally one or two contestants whose connections are more obvious, either via their looks and voice, what they say in the side interviews, or both. We have some pretty good guesses about Adam, for instance, given his looks, his speaking voice and the fact that he didn't sing during the talent show because he sounds exactly like his famous relative. Others aren't as obvious, even after the Clue Wall was opened to show a massive collage of clues to both us and the housemates.\n\nThere are people for whom our guesses turned out to be wrong, and that's the best part of the show. You get sucked into guessing, gloat when you're right and have your mind blown when you're wrong.\n\nThis year, it seems that a few of the contestants that are trying to throw people off. Gracie Lou, for instance, is trying to foster a profile that connects her to country music, even though she admits that she's not all that connected. Shane is boisterous and wears a chicken drumstick on a chain around his neck. Dedrick blurts out a famous last name, seemingly by mistake, but no one can be sure if it's not done on purpose.\n\nThese acts of subterfuge are amusing but don't seem to be all that complex in nature, and the smarter contestants will see through them. In essence, the show will come down to the usual alliances and other arrangements contestants make with each other, judging which contestants are the strongest and targeting them.\n\nSex and Skin: None.\n\nParting Shot: When Dedrick lets that famous last name fall out of his mouth, Naomi wonders if he did that on purpose or not. She feels it was accidental.\n\nSleeper Star: We just appreciated the fact that both Naomi and Gracie Lou have good singing voices. We also liked the fact that Naomi looked perturbed when Gracie Lou sang after she did, completely wiping out any good vibes her singing brought.\n\nMost Pilot-y Line: Like most reality shows of this type, things are stretched way too much, with editing putting pauses before names are given, and lots of camera cuts to look at reactions that weren't necessarily of that moment.\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. We like Claim To Fame because the contestants are real people; they're not trying to be famous themselves, but they have relatives that are. It's pure competition for the most part, and that's why the show seems to be so much more fun to watch than other similarly-formatted reality shows.\n\nJoel Keller (@joelkeller) writes about food, entertainment, parenting and tech, but he doesn't kid himself: he's a TV junkie.

In Season 1, Chuck Norris' grandson was sent packing in the premiere after producers realized he'd snuck a phone into the house. In Season 2, the niece of Tom Hanks threw a temper tantrum after being correctly identified by another contestant, screaming as she packed, \"I SHOULD HAVE MORE CAMERA TIME!\" Season 3's first player to be eliminated, Bianca, who turned out to be Good Morning America host Robin Roberts' niece, seemed to break the curse, exiting the show without prompting a scandal, and with a kind video message from her aunt.\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that she wouldn't have liked to run through the house screaming like last year's first evictee. \"Nobody has any information right up front, not that early,\" she told Parade in an exclusive interview after her exit. Deciding the first boot in Season 3 was a total crap shoot.\n\nAfter losing the talent show challenge, Bianca found herself in the bottom two up against Miguel. She was then voted to be the guesser by her fellow nepo babies and took a shot in the dark guessing that Shane was related to Forest Whitaker. When she was wrong, her relative was revealed and she was sent home.\n\nRelated: The 'Claim to Fame' Season 3 Cast, Their 'Two Truths and a Lie' and Our First Guesses About Their Identities\n\nI got a message on Instagram, and someone asked me if I was interested in being on a reality show. I really thought it was a scam. They told me to check out the show and see if it was something I might be interested in. I watched it, and I was like, \"Totally.\"\n\nAt what point did you talk to your aunt about going on the show?\n\nDuring casting. They did say, \"You might want to reach out and ask your auntie if she's OK with it.\" And I told her about it. She was like, \"Go for it. Do it.\"\n\nWhat's your relationship with her like outside the show?\n\nI mean, she's just my aunt. When people find out that I'm related to her, they're like, \"Oh, do you really know her?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I have her phone number. I can call her anytime. I can text her. I don't have to be passed through anyone to be in contact with her.\" Monthly we get on a call as a family, and we all chat. I am her oldest niece, her first niece. So yeah, we've always had a really good relationship.\n\nWhat was your strategy coming into the house? Did you have any plans to throw people off and keep your identity a secret?\n\nMy plan was to be a mother figure. Maybe people would be like, \"Oh, she's kind of old, so maybe we could bond,\" and I could get information about them. As far as hiding my identity, I was just really confident that people would not put any anything together about who I was related to.\n\nRelated: Claim to Fame Producer Answers Our Behind-the-Scenes Questions (Exclusive)\n\nYou lost the talent show challenge in the premiere and that ended up sending you home. Did you think it was going poorly as it happened?\n\nI didn't think it was going poorly. I tried to make sure that there was one talent that I felt I did the best at and then I wasn't really worried about the other two talents. It was pretty shocking to me that it turned out the way it turned out.\n\nWhat were your three talents?\n\nI did a ribbon dance, a comedy sketch and then a little painting.\n\nGoing into the guess off, it looks like nobody in the house has any idea who anyone is. Was everyone completely in the dark?\n\nThat definitely was the vibe when I was there. I know previously people like Tom Hanks' niece had a big meltdown and was like, \"I've only been here for three days!\" I could see honestly having that reaction being the first to be eliminated. Nobody has any information right up front, not that early. Everyone was in the dark. It could have been anyone up there, and whoever was up there would have gone home.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need to Know About Claim to Fame Season 2 (Including Who Won)\n\nThe clue wall opened up while you guys were in the house. How long did you have to look at that before the guess off?\n\nIf I remember, like a few hours.\n\nWere there any clues that you spotted that connected to your aunt?\n\nIn this season, the cast included 11 people rather than 12 like the first two seasons. Was there any discussion in the house about there being fewer people?\n\nI just figured this was something the producers decided to do this time. I didn't think it was weird. I didn't think that there was any special reason why they did it that way, or that someone got sick.\n\nHave you talked to your aunt about what happened on the show?\n\nNo, I haven't told anybody what happened. Everyone is anxious to see the show.\n\nDo you have any plans for a watch party?\n\nI did have plans for a watch party, but since I am in Houston and Hurricane Beryl just came through. There's no power anywhere. I'm actually at my parents' house because they have a generator. It looks like our quote unquote \"watch party\" might be at their house, but most people don't have power.", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_huff@thestate.com", "name": "Matthew Huff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forest Whitaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/spcoi6/picture289952604/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2f6ab893-c2c1-4b12-9b88-abe77367f78c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723224", "eventUri": "eng-9723224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

This time it is the mere threat of potential elimination that has one player, Miguel, in shambles.\n\nEarlier in the episode, we learn Miguel is related to an Oscar-winning actor, but is probably lying about it being his grandfather. Oh, also, his name is not really Miguel, as he admits in a confessional he's using the fake moniker to \"make people think I am more Spanish than I actually am.\" He seems to be onto something as the first guess we hear uttered for his relative is (the un-grandfatherly) Antonio Banderas.\n\nThings come to a head for Miguel during the customary Claim to Fame talent show, which features such talents as Hud, the show's resident new hunk, getting kinda sweaty while jumping rope and Bianca painting a pre-school-caliber heart with the show's initials, \"CTF.\" Miguel attempts to recite a poem while inexplicably holding a volleyball, but is only shown apologizing for forgetting the words.\n\nMiguel is visibly devastated after he and Bianca are named the bottom two, meaning one of them will be determined by a group vote to be the night's guesser, putting them on the spot to correctly guess another contestant's relative or be sent home.\n\nBack at the house, Miguel hides in a bathroom away from the cameras, but his mic is still very much on. \"Please God. I know I don't pray often and I know I'm not a very good Christian, but please, please, please help me,\" he whispers.\n\nAnother player, Adam, comes looking for him as Miguel is heard repeating, \"Just don't cry on camera. Don't cry on camera. Don't cry on camera.\"\n\nHe finally emerges, looking shaken and covering his eyes with one arm, and tells Adam he doesn't want to let his mom down and needs to be the man of the house, one who provides.\n\n\"When I was younger my mother ended up in the hospital, went through some really hard times, and my celebrity relative stepped in to help,\" he shares during a confessional.\n\nMiguel tells Adam he doesn't know who anyone in the house is related to, which makes the other player consider him a \"non-threat\" and opt to vote for Bianca instead, though Adam does admit he might be getting played. At this point, it is hard to tell what's authentic and what's an attempt for 15 more minutes of fame. After all, Miguel does earlier admit he's \"gonna do whatever the f--- I have to\" to win. But like Adam says, \"He's a nice young kid,\" so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt that his emotions are not purely for the camera.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nThe next day, Miguel goes on an eavesdropping mission in which he learns Bianca's guesses for himself (Desi Arnaz) and Shane (Forest Whitaker). He lets Shane know that Bianca is gunning for him, then literally runs all through the house in a full panic, campaigning for others to choose Bianca over him.\n\n\"I need the money so badly, please God,\" he's heard praying again in reference to the show's $100,000 grand prize.\n\nWhether it be thanks to his campaigning or his praying, Miguel is victorious as the others choose Bianca to be guesser by a single vote difference. Bianca chooses to guess Shane, sticking with her guess that he's related to the Last King of Scotland Oscar winner. This turns out to be wrong and Bianca is eliminated.

As the contestants gather around the table the next morning, Dedrick, who is only known to the group as the nephew of a famous singer who possibly won a best rock song of the year award, drops a whopper of a reveal.\n\nAs he tells a story about his accident-prone children, Dedrick muses, \"I walk into the ER or something and they'll be like, 'For real, Mr. Jackson, again?'\"\n\nHe quickly glazes over his blunder, but Naomi catches the last name reveal and connects it to a potential Michael Jackson clue on the clue wall: a scarecrow from The Wiz.\n\nIf it was an intentional red herring, we may have a new Claim to Fame mastermind on our hands.

Was this a smart theory? It feels that way. After all, this is someone who has more physical similarities to him than almost any other person does to their celebrity relatives. They have some similar facial features and beyond just that, they have some really similar vocal clues at the same time. (Unfortunately, Adam did not say all that much about Captain Jack Sparrow in this episode, which is certainly disappointing.)\n\nLuckily for Adam, in the first episode there was no real evidence that he would be in danger anytime soon. He was not up for elimination, and nor were there a lot of people speculating about him. The one major clue that we did get in this episode is that his celebrity relative is older, so he would like to see older contestants go since they may be able to figure this out easier.\n\nWe are going to keep watch when it comes to Adam's progress this season, but one thing that certainly benefits him here is that it's hard to really think of that many clues that you would directly associate with him and potentially Bolton. After all, how many visual clues can you give for some sad, emotional ballads? He could be a frontrunner to win this whole thing, though at the same time it's still early and because of that, there is room aplenty for things to veer in all sorts of different directions.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more news on Claim to Fame now, including some other celebrity clues\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

However, Hud may be a little bit of an outlier, at least when you compare him to everyone else. After all, we have seen him appear in the past on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Teddi Mellencamp was a cast member on that show -- hence, the connection.\n\nNow, is there a chance that any of the other players are going to be able to figure this out? It's understandable if, in this environment, they would not remember someone from a brief reality TV appearance years ago -- and they'd have to be watching in order to be aware of this in the first place. This is a little too complicated of a cocktail for a show like this. Instead, they would have to rely more on some classic Claim to Fame elements, whether it be Two Truths and a Lie or what is going on when it comes to the Clue Wall, which was blocked from contestants' eyes early on.\n\nOne early advantage that we thought Hud could have?

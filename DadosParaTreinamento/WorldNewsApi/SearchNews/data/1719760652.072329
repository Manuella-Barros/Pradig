Kelly Knipes, 42, from Basildon in Essex began to notice she was sleepwalking regularly after the birth of her first child Henry in 2006. But the sleepwalking soon developed into sleep shopping - a habit which has seen her splash \u00a33,000 unknowingly while snoozing. Kelly's expensive purchases include a full-sized plastic basketball court and hundreds of pounds worth of Haribo sweets. In 2010, long before being diagnosed, she woke up one day to the delivery of an 'in-ground basketball unit' including a net, pole and backboard, bought on eBay for \u00a3100. Kelly Knipes from Basildon in Essex began to notice she was sleepwalking regularly after the birth of her first child Henry in 2006 The mother-of-three has been undergoing tests to try and work out teh root cause of her sleep walking She also bought tins of paint, books about teaching, salt and pepper pots, a Wendy house, fridges and tables. Kelly said has racked up a debt of 'at least' \u00a33k - although she has thankfully paid this off now. She explained: 'I couldn't refund any food purchases, like the Haribos. I kept the tins of paint, and the Wendy house because when that arrived and my kids saw it I felt I couldn't return it. In March, Kelly received a spam text impersonating the government, offering financial assistance for her bills. While sleeping, she gave the scammers her financial information and has since been targeted several times after she suspects they sold on her information. Kelly's sleep-shopping h habit has seen her splash \u00a33k unknowingly while snoozing Kelly said: 'I filled out a form after I got this text - I wouldn't have replied to it if I was awake. It was this scam that said I was owed \u00a3400 from the government to help with my bills. 'I gave them all my details, then when I woke up, they had taken \u00a3250 out my bank account.' Kelly managed to get the money back from the bank but reckons her personal information has been sold on by the scammers. There have been five further attempts made to withdraw different sums of money from her account. What is parasomnia and how does it affect your sleep? According to sleep expert Sophie Bostock, parasomnia is the name given to a whole family of sleeping disorders which are the abnormal things that can happen to us while we sleep. 'It is caused by faulty transitions between the stages of sleep or between the stage of sleep and wakefulness,' she said. 'It's often about wakefulness intruding into your normal sleep.' 'Often it's because we're actually quite sleep deprived. So there's a part of your brain hanging on to deep sleep and part of your brain that's kinda woken up and you've got this faulty transition going on.' \u2018Anything that reduces the stability of sleep \u2014 such as alcohol, coffee, stress \u2014 can trigger a parasomnia,\u2019 explained Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist and clinical lead for the sleep centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London. \u2018As a society we are generally a little sleep deprived, and we know poor sleep habits can also make some parasomnias worse.\u2019 Patients with sleep apnoea \u2014 a condition affecting 1.5 million Britons \u2014 may also be prone. Here, the muscles of the throat relax during sleep, interrupting breathing and causing the patient to wake briefly. These brief arousals could trigger parasomnia. Parasomnias can take various forms including eating while you sleep or acting out your dreams. Advertisement She said: 'I've had to cancel my cards several times. Once I gave my details to that one scam, it was the ricochet effect. 'Since the first time I've had people trying to take anything from \u00a320 to \u00a3200 - but luckily the bank blocks them.' The mother-of-three continued: 'I would never actually have to put any credit card details when when I was buying things online because it was all saved on my phone. I was racking up debt everywhere. I just think over the years, all the money just mounts. 'I've had to cancel cards a few times, and I've had lots of people try to take money out my bank. It can be anxiety-inducing. 'It's really upsetting and frustrating going to bed thinking: I don't know what the night is going to lead to.' In 2018, Kelly was found to suffer from a condition called parasomnia. Parasomnia is a disruptive sleep-related disorders that can involve abnormal movements, actions and speaking occuring while you're asleep. Kelly thinks the disorder was sparked by her sleep apnoea - where she stops breathing in her sleep. Sleep apnoea forces her brain to partially wake and makes her do things while still asleep - such as browsing online shops. But the disorder was more than just an online shopping habit. Kelly once took an overdose of diabetes medication when she was pregnant due to the disorder, in 2015, because she dreamt she was speaking to doctors. When she lived in a ground floor flat, she would wake to find doors and windows open after she'd been up in the night. She would wake up 'drained' and 'exhausted' and ended up hospitalised. Her GP thought it was caused by the stress of having three disabled children - Henry, 18, who has epilepsy, Joey, nine, who is deaf and also has epilepsy, and Carson, eight, who has learning difficulties. But eventually a different doctor in 2018 found it was down to obstructive sleep apnea - which would cause her brain to partially wake.

But it hasn't been a miracle cure for Kelly - as the CPAP causes her jaw to lock and she unwittingly removes the machine from her face in her sleep. Kelly also struggles with sleeping pills, as she needs to be able to hear her children in the night in case they need help. Six years on from her diagnosis, Kelly is still finding herself plagued by her sleep habits, but tries not to let it affect her, instead choosing to prioritise looking after her three sons. She said: 'Everyone thinks it's funny but it's not, some bits are, but some bits are quite serious. 'Giving out my details has had quite big consequences. But it's the least of my problems, in the grand scheme of things, I just focus on my children. It's just something that happens that I have to deal with.' eBay Share or comment on this article: I shop in my sleep because of a rare disorder - I've racked up \u00a33,000 debt and even been scammed e-mail Add comment", "summary": "Kelly Knipes, 42, from Basildon in Essex\u00a0began to notice she was sleepwalking regularly after the birth of her first child Henry in 2006", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13471391/mother-sleep-shopping-disorder-scammed-debt.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/29/12/85462465-0-image-m-16_1716983735169.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:31:11", "author": "Editor,Lauren Hughes", "authors": ["Editor", "Lauren Hughes"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.538}

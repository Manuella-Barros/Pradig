King Charles was joined by his son, next in line to the throne, Prince William, who was in turn accompanied by his three children, Prince George (10), Princess Charlotte (9), and Prince Louis (6).\n\nTypically, the Royals are extremely cautious about bringing together everyone who could conceivably take over the monarchy, which is why you'll only see multiple generations together like this at major events such as weddings or funerals. For that same reason, William and Kate Middleton's kids will soon be kept apart when they travel in order to ensure the safety of the line of succession.\n\nThanks to King Charles' former pilot, we've discovered the existence of a key rule when it comes to the Royal family's travel plans that reveals just how terrified they are that disaster could strike at any moment.\n\nGraham Laurie used to fly the then-Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and the young Prince William and Harry around and he's now revealed that, once the now Prince of Wales turned 12, he was forbidden from traveling with his brother and the rest of the family. Laurie told Ok! (via GBNews):\n\n\"We flew all four: the Prince, the Princess, Prince William, and Prince Harry, up until Prince William was 12 years old,\" Laurie explained. \"After that, he had to have a separate aircraft and we could only fly all four together when they were young with the written permission of Her Majesty. When William became 12, he would fly normally in a 125 from Northolt and we would fly the 146 out with the other three on.\"\n\nThis Royal rule is not unique to Charles' children as it's a widespread ban the family has adopted in order to protect the line of succession. The fear is that the plane could crash, thereby wiping out all the immediate heirs to the throne in one swoop. As for how this affects William and Catherine's kids, this means that George can continue traveling with his brother and sister and parents for a while yet, but this will change once he turns 12 on July 22, 2025.\n\nIt may sound a bit extreme, but actually the Royal family is no stranger to plane crashes. Three Royals have died in three separate incidents over the past century. Prince Philip's sister, Princess Cecilie, died in 1937, Queen Elizabeth II's uncle, another Prince George, perished in 1942, while her cousin, another Prince William, passed in 1972.\n\nThe Royals are a superstitious bunch who often fear that history's going to repeat itself, so the incoming ban is maybe not surprising -- even if William and Kate's kids might soon miss their family trips together.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_bone@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Christian Bone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_succession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of succession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince George, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Cecilie_of_Greece_and_Denmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royals_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Royals (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northolt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northolt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northolt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2157760298-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721765", "eventUri": "eng-9721765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Despite experts claiming that Prince George will never be King, the young royal - who turns 11 years old this month - is the second in line to the throne, and when Prince William is officially crowned as the monarch and the royal line of succession changes, George's future path will look very different to that of his younger siblings.\n\nOver the years, royal insiders have spoken about how the Prince and Princess of Wales are 'acutely aware' of the problems that Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis face as they grow older, and are working hard 'to make them feel every bit as special, loved and valued as George'. Prince Harry famously spoke about his experience of being a sibling to the future King in his book Spare, and shared his concern that the two youngest Wales children would suffer the same fate.\n\nHowever, William and Kate have reportedly already worked out Charlotte's future role within the family, and while she will never be a Duchess due to an old royal rule, she could be set to inherit the title of Princess Royal.\n\nAs for little Louis, who turned 6 in April, he could be set to take on a title that currently belongs to his great-uncle, Prince Andrew. The late Queen Elizabeth II gifted Prince Andrew a Dukedom when he married Sarah Ferguson in 1986, and he has since been known as the Duke of York. It held sentimental value for the former monarch, as her father, King George VI, and her grandfather, King George V, both held the title.\n\nAs per tradition, the Duke of York title is handed down to the monarch's second oldest son. If the family is to follow the historic rule, it means that - as long as the title is vacant when Prince William is crowned King - it could be kept for Louis until the day of his own wedding.\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry were both gifted Dukedoms on their wedding days. When William and Kate walked down the aisle in 2011, the couple was given the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge titles. Similarly, when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed in 2018, they were given the Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jadie_troy_pryde@marieclaire.co.uk", "name": "Jadie Troy-Pryde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_succession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of succession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_of_Denmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandra of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Cambridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George VI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah,_Duchess_of_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah, Duchess of York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KrrqnMS5mfVViSduCv3dwK-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721765", "eventUri": "eng-9721765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Some make sense, like curtsying and wearing certain clothes at major events, while others seem downright odd, like not showing children much affection in public. (Luckily, Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, have no problem ignoring that protocol for their lively children!) Speaking of William and Catherine's children, it seems one of them is about to undergo a major change, specifically with how they travel.\n\nAs many loyal royal fans know, William and Catherine's son Prince George will be turning 11 on July 22. While nothing big will come from that, for the most part, something major will happen when he turns 12 years old next year: he'll no longer be able to fly with his dad, William.\n\nPer The Mirror, George will no longer be able to fly with William due to royal protocols ensuring the future of the monarchy. Let us explain: George is second-in-line for the throne, with his dad William being first-in-line. Because of this, when George turns 12, they have to ensure his safety by making him take separate flights.\n\n\"There is an important royal custom in place to secure the future of the monarchy by restricting who can travel together on the same plane,\" the outlet said. \"The unique restriction is in place to protect the heirs to the throne. While the rule can be broken with the monarch's permission, it is discouraged since, in the event of a crash, the future of the monarchy would be immediately unstable.\"\n\nSo, it's to ensure everyone's safety. But flying has been a big point of contention in the family, especially for the Wales family.\n\nIt was reported by the Daily Mail back in 2022 that the late Queen Elizabeth II repeatedly asked William not to fly helicopters, especially to not pilot them himself because it could \"threaten the line of succession.\"\n\nThe report said, \"It keeps the Queen awake at night, and she is understandably very worried. She knows William is a capable pilot but does not think it is worth the risk for all five of them to carry on flying together and can't imagine what would happen. It would spark a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nFor those who don't know, William and Kate have been together on and off since 2003. They married in 2011, and recently celebrated their anniversary with a throwback photo that weirdly enough caused controversy.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "delilah_gray@sheknows.com", "name": "Delilah Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_succession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of succession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/george-william.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721765", "eventUri": "eng-9721765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 570, "textEnd": 577}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

But there is one tradition that the dad of three is not a fan of.\n\nKate has given an insight into her family's birthday rituals in the past - including the fact that she stays up until midnight making birthday cakes for Prince George, Princess Charlotte and little Prince Louis. And it seems there is a special role that dad William also takes on - albeit with less enthusiasm.\n\nOne of Prince George's godparents is Julia Samuel, a good friend of the late Princess Diana. And she previously revealed the noisy tradition she has passed on to the Wales family. She said: \"I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making.\n\n\"William then has to spend days putting them together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.\" She added that while poor William struggles for days on end to put together the tricky toys, the rest of the family takes great pleasure in watching him squirm - especially \"cheeky\" George at the time. She explained that it \"makes [her] laugh, and it makes George laugh.\"\n\nJulia talked about the sweet tradition when she was a guest on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day - in an episode in 2020 to mark what would have been Diana's 59th birthday. Diana never got to meet her grandchildren since she died following a car crash in Paris in August 1997 at the age of just 36. Describing her adorable godson, Julia said he was \"amazing\" - adding her dear friend Diana would have adored him too. \"He's funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much,\" she said. \"That is heartbreaking for all of them.\"\n\nWilliam has spoken in the past about the importance of keeping his mother's memory alive by making sure his children know all about their late grandmother. During an appearance in the 2017 ITV documentary 'Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy', William \"So we've got more photos up round the house now of her and we talk about her a bit and stuff. And it's hard because obviously Catherine didn't know her, so she cannot really provide that level of detail.\n\n\"So I do, regularly, putting George or Charlotte to bed, talk about her and just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers, there were two grandmothers in their lives.

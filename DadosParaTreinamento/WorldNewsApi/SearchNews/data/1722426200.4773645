At 67, Nimoy\u2019s new memoir, \u201cThe Most Human: Reconciling with My Father, Leonard Nimoy\u201d (Chicago Review Press), examines the gulf between the public image of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d icon and the reality of a distant father. Also stressed is the importance of the 12-step program that helped father and son reconcile, heal and bond. Nimoy makes an appearance June 30 at Boston\u2019s West End Museum, the neighborhood in which his father grew up. \u201cThis is really the story of the journey of my father and myself, where I started to come around and reconcile with my dad. That\u2019s the focus,\u201d he said in a phone interview from his LA home. Leonard Nimoy, he readily conceded, \u201cwas a difficult man to communicate with and on a personal level, it was hard to connect with him. We didn\u2019t have many things in common \u2014 until I started watching him on TV. \u201cHe was a man of few words, much like his father. He could be very introspective, distant and cool. There was a discomfort with him, where I just didn\u2019t feel connected with him.\u201d His mother compensated. \u201cMy sister and I were very fortunate that our mother was very affectionate, loving and supportive. We really felt loved and taken care of by her. Also, her parents had moved to Los Angeles from Cordova, Alaska, and they were also very demonstrative, very affectionate people. So we had good modeling on that front.\u201d His book notes how father and son both ventured down parallel paths with marriages leading to divorce, battling addiction and finding recovery. \u201cThat worked out well. We had a very great relationship the last years of his life. We had similar experiences: My dad and mom were married for 32 years and that marriage ended. Not long thereafter, my dad went into recovery. \u201cMy marriage ended after 18 years, and immediately I went into 12-step recovery. \u201cMy dad was the alcoholic in the family, something that he had admitted to on many occasions. I was mostly a pothead; I smoked pot pretty much every day for 30 years. \u201cI never considered myself an alcoholic. But I identify as one because I go to AA meetings because it\u2019s 12-step recovery. It\u2019s all the same. Alcohol was not what we call our drug of choice. It was just marijuana. \u201cBut the recovery work is all the same. We abstain from everything, and we practice the same principles of working the program. \u201cWith my dad, we finally figured out how to reconcile with one another and become very close.\u201d Adam Nimoy will be in conversation about \u201cThe Most Human: Reconciling with My Father, Leonard Nimoy\u201d at 4 p.m. Sunday at the West End Museum, 150 Stanford St., Suite 7, Boston. Tickets are $10. Trident Booksellers will be present with copies of the book.", "summary": "Growing up with Spock as a father, Adam Nimoy discovered early, was not easy.", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/06/29/adam-nimoy-shares-journey-in-the-most-human-reconciling-with-my-father/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BHR-L-NIMOY-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:20:28", "author": "Stephen Schaefer", "authors": ["Stephen Schaefer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.247}

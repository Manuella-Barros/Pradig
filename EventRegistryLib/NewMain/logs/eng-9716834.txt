The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. She's leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 a game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant. She is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nThe Aces star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. She became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nCheryl Reeve gets the mid-season nod for Coach of the Year. She guided the Minnesota Lynx to a Commissioner's Cup title and has the team sitting in third in the standings. Reeve was a near unanimous choice, with Connecticut's Stephanie White garnering the only other vote.\n\nAP WNBA poll\n\nNew York remains in the top spot in this week's AP WNBA power poll with Connecticut moving back into second. Las Vegas, Minnesota and Seattle were the next three. Indiana and Phoenix were tied for sixth. Chicago and Atlanta followed. Washington, Los Angeles and Dallas rounded out the poll.\n\nCaitlin corner\n\nClark has had double figure assists in her last three games, including a 19-point, 12-rebound and 13-assist effort against New York last Saturday. The Fever have gone 6-3 in their last nine games. Indiana has a busy upcoming week, hosting Washington and Phoenix before visiting Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nRookie watch\n\nRickea Jackson has come into her own lately. The fourth overall pick by the Los Angeles' Sparks averaged 16 points 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists last week. She had a season-best 22 points in a loss to Phoenix.\n\nMoving up the scoring list\n\nTina Charles is 95 points behind Tina Thompson for second place on the WNBA all-time scoring list after the Atlanta Dream forward moved past Tamika Catchings on Sunday. Charles has scored 7,394 points in her career.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nWilson earned AP Player of the Week honors. The Aces forward averaged 27.3 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks to help Las Vegas go 3-1. Other players receiving votes included Reese and Clark.\n\nGame of the week\n\nNew York at Connecticut, Wednesday. The teams with the top records in the WNBA will meet in a matinee camp day game.

One person didn't vote.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses. It has been a complete joy for me to witness how both players have evolved as professionals in such a short amount of time in the league.\"\n\nClark is leading the WNBA in points accounted for (points plus points off assists) with 713 according to ESPN. The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. She's leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 a game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant. She is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nThe Aces star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. She became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nCheryl Reeve gets the mid-season nod for Coach of the Year. She guided the Minnesota Lynx to a Commissioner's Cup title and has the team sitting in third in the standings. Reeve was a near unanimous choice, with Connecticut's Stephanie White garnering the only other vote.\n\nClark has had double figure assists in her last three games, including a 19-point, 12-rebound and 13-assist effort against New York last Saturday. The Fever have gone 6-3 in their last nine games. Indiana has a busy upcoming week, hosting Washington and Phoenix before visiting Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nRookie watch\n\nRickea Jackson has come into her own lately. The fourth overall pick by the Los Angeles' Sparks averaged 16 points 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists last week. She had a season-best 22 points in a loss to Phoenix.\n\nMoving up the scoring list\n\nTina Charles is 95 points behind Tina Thompson for second place on the WNBA all-time scoring list after the Atlanta Dream forward moved past Tamika Catchings on Sunday. Charles has scored 7,394 points in her career.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nWilson earned AP Player of the Week honors. The Aces forward averaged 27.3 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks to help Las Vegas go 3-1. Other players receiving votes included Reese and Clark.\n\nGame of the week\n\nNew York at Connecticut, Wednesday. The teams with the top records in the WNBA will meet in a matinee camp day game. They'll play once more in New York next Tuesday before taking a few weeks off before the Olympic break.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors":

She\u00b4s leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 a game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant.

The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Indiana Fever, 88-82.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon against the Washington Mystics, Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark made history yet again. But this time, it wasn't a record any player would want to break.\n\nAfter picking up her fifth turnover of the game, Clark passed late Mystics star Nikki McCray's record for the most turnovers in a rookie season in WNBA history. Her record-tying turnover was her 127th of the season, passing McCray's 126, which she achieved in 1998. What's even more unfortunate for Clark is that it took her 23 games to reach this number, whereas it took McCray 29 games.\n\nThe good news for Clark in breaking this kind of record is that the career leaders in turnovers are some of the best to ever play the game of basketball. Diana Taurasi has the most in the WNBA with 1490, and LeBron James has the most in the NBA with 5,211. Clark is going down the right path in a way.\n\nClark is also on pace to break the single-season WNBA turnover record held by Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas, with 137 turnovers in 2023.\n\nClark is averaging a league-leading 5.5 turnovers per game, which is 1.7 more than the next highest.\n\nDespite this embarrassing new record, Clark is still having a great rookie season. She will join fellow rookie Angel Reese as the only two rookies to make the WNBA All-Star game.\n\nClark has also broken numerous good records throughout the season. She became the fastest to reach 300 or more points, 100 or more assists, and 100 or more rebounds in WNBA history. She also became the first rookie ever to record a triple-double.\n\nRelated: Erica Wheeler Used One Word To Describe WNBA's Treatment Of Caitlin Clark\n\nRelated: WNBA Facing Intense Backlash Over Decision On Caitlin Clark, Indiana Fever Game", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_McCray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikki McCray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/6f/f6fb3cef-4147-5d55-867d-29e8d1305e09/668ed80839106.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Both of them were selected as WNBA All-Stars, the first time since 2014 the league has had two rookies chosen, so it's no surprise that they're the leading candidates for the award given to the top new player.\n\nThe pair, billed as rivals since their college days, have helped the league to huge increases in ratings, attendance and merchandise sales, and with so much basketball still to be played an argument, can be made for either to win the award.\n\nAt the halfway point, though, the 15-member panel gives the edge to Clark in a 9-5 vote. One member of the panel didn't vote in this case.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the WNBA's Washington Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses.\n\n\"It has been a complete joy for me to witness how both players have evolved as professionals in such a short amount of time in the league.\"\n\nClark is leading the WNBA in points accounted for (points plus points off assists) with 713, according to ESPN. She also became the league's first rookie to have a triple-double in a game, finishing with 19 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds during the Fever's 83-78 victory over the league-leading New York Liberty this past Saturday.\n\nClark has tallied double-figure assists in her past three games, and the Fever have gone 6-3 in their past nine to improve to 9-13.\n\nChicago Tribune photo by Eileen T. Meslar via AP / Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese is interviewed by ESPN's Holly Rowe after a home win against Indiana Fever on June 23.\n\nMeanwhile, Reese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Reese is also leading the league in rebounding, having averaged 11.9 a game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for WNBA player of the year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year, when the Aces repeated as champions, and has been even more dominant this year, having averaged 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game entering Tuesday.\n\nThe star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. The No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft, Wilson became her franchise's all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nFinally, Cheryl Reeve gets the midseason nod for coach of the year from the panel. She guided the Minnesota Lynx to the title in the Commissioner's Cup in-season competition and had her team third in the standings at 15-6 entering Tuesday, behind the Liberty and the Connecticut Sun, who are both 17-4.\n\nReeve was nearly a unanimous choice, with Stephanie White garnering the only other vote.\n\nWhile much of the spotlight for a standout rookie class has gone to Clark and Reese, former Mississippi State and Tennessee standout Rickea Jackson has come into her own lately for the Los Angeles Sparks. The fourth overall pick averaged 16 points 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists last week, when she had a season-best 22 points in a loss to the Phoenix Mercury.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com",

Because most WNBA players would tell you it's harder for a guard to translate right away in the W than it is for a post player,\" Duncan said on The Elle Duncan Show.\n\n\"Because she's going up against that aspect of it, I'll still probably give the nod to Caitlin Clark for Rookie of the Year, but I think it's going to be a great race,\" Duncan continued.\n\nClark is averaging 16.1 points, 7.4 assists and 6.0 rebounds per game. Reese is averaging 14.1 points, 11.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals per contest.\n\n\"I don't think it should be as close as maybe people think it is gonna be,\" Gary Striewski replied. \"...

The Fever look to hold on to the seventh seed in the WNBA Playoffs with a win.\n\nBefore the game, Clark joined The Wake Up Call with KB and Andy on 107.5 The Fan and discussed her recent 2024 Paris Olympics snub. When asked how mad she was about not making Team USA, Clark gave an answer that should worry the WNBA.\n\n\"Honestly, I wasn't really pissed. More than anything, it was a motivator. It gives you something to work for.,\" Clark said. \"It doesn't make me want to prove people wrong. It almost makes me want to prove to myself like I can do this. I can be there. I think the best thing about this for me is like it's shown me a lot of ways I can grow, and I've already been able to do a lot of great things.\"\n\nIn her first season in the WNBA, Clark was selected to the All-Star team and became the first WNBA rookie ever to record a triple-double.\n\n\"I just still feel like there is so many areas I can improve, and that makes me so excited,\" Clark said. \"Sure, I average whatever I average, but I still feel like there's so many ways for me to get better. And that's the most exciting part.\"\n\nClark has already proven that her basketball skills will translate from her college days with the Iowa Hawkeyes to the WNBA. As the season has progressed, she has improved. In four of the last five games, Clark has recorded a double-double. She had two in the previous 17 games.\n\nClark has enhanced a Fever team that was at the bottom of the WNBA standings last season. She has them in a position to make the playoffs for the first time in almost ten years. If she has found more motivation to get better, as she mentioned above, the WNBA should watch out.\n\nRelated: WNBA Facing Intense Backlash Over Decision On Caitlin Clark, Indiana Fever Game\n\nRelated: Erica Wheeler Used One Word To Describe WNBA's Treatment Of Caitlin Clark", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/aa/4aafcd3e-9f1d-568c-8aad-ef89adfe6fb5/668eb88ab05f3.image.jpg?crop=1167%2C613%2C0%2C93&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

They all deserve the same praise. I don't want it to take away from any of that and just be the focal point of All-Star weekend because that's not fair to them.\n\n\"Just going to obviously soak in the experience because you never know if you're ever going to get back there.\"\n\nClark has yet to reveal if she will participate in the 3-point contest, saying last Friday, it \"remains to be seen.\n\n\"We'll see. I don't know, I haven't decided, I don't know. I can't give you guys every answer today.\"\n\nClark and Reese have also continued to dominate the NIL space.\n\nThe Fever guard's first Wilson signature basketballs became available on Tuesday.\n\nReese confirmed in May that she is getting her own signature Reebok sneaker line.\n\nThe national panel of voters, per AP, also chose Las Vegas forward A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season.\n\nWilson -- a two-time WNBA champion, two-time league MVP and two-time Defensive Play of the Year -- is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks this season, which is already better than in 2023, when she finished third in MVP voting.\n\nThe Nike athlete -- whose signature shoe, \"A'One,\" will arrive in 2025 -- became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday in a 104-85 win against the Wings.\n\nWilson will face Clark and Reese in the WNBA All-Star game.\n\nWilson will represent Team USA, which includes the WNBA stars competing at the Paris Olympics, and Clark and Reese will become first-time teammates on Team WNBA.\n\nThe WNBA All-Star game will air on ABC and ESPN will air a skills challenge and a 3-point contest

Five chose Reese, and one abstained.\n\nChristy Winters-Scott, an analyst who covers the Washington Mystics, explained why she voted for the Indiana Fever newcomer over the Chicago Sky sensation.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" Winters-Scott said. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses. It has been a complete joy for me to witness how both players have evolved as professionals in such a short amount of time in the league.\"\n\nClark and Reese continue to up the ante in what's shaping up to be an exciting (and likely polarizing) award race.\n\nThe Fever have recovered from a sluggish start to win seven of their last 11 games. Clark is averaging 16.1 points, 7.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds per game after posting her first triple-double in Saturday's upset over the New York Liberty.\n\nMeanwhile, Reese broke Candace Parker's record by registering her 13th straight double-double on Sunday. The No. 7 pick is averaging 14.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per contest with the highest PER (19.8) of all WNBA rookies.\n\nReese is on pace to set a WNBA rookie rebound record, but Clark could set the first-year assists milestone. They've each collected 30 steals, tied for most among rookies.\n\nAny perceived advantage Clark has over Reese -- especially if going off team results -- could easily evaporate over the second half. But the Fever and Sky won't clash for this season's final matchup until Aug. 30.\n\nRelated: Everyone's Debating Angel Reese vs. Caitlin Clark For Rookie Of The Year", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Winters-Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christy Winters-Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/44/8449061e-420e-59ec-a08f-b7f0db3a6d54/668dc9f0020f5.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 1711, "textEnd": 1718}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

One person didn't vote.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses.

The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. She's leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 per game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant. She is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nThe Aces star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. She became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nCheryl Reeve gets the mid-season nod for Coach of the Year.

The Fever have gone 6-3 in their last nine games. Indiana has a busy upcoming week, hosting Washington and Phoenix before visiting Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nRookie watch\n\nRickea Jackson has come into her own lately.

She had a season-best 22 points in a loss to Phoenix.\n\nScoring list\n\nTina Charles is 95 points behind Tina Thompson for second place on the WNBA all-time scoring list after the Atlanta Dream forward moved past Tamika Catchings on Sunday. Charles has scored 7,394 points in her career.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nWilson earned AP Player of the Week honors.

One person didn't vote.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses.

The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. She's leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 per game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant. She is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nThe Aces star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. She became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nCheryl Reeve gets the mid-season nod for Coach of the Year. She guided the Minnesota Lynx to a Commissioner's Cup title and has the team sitting in third in the standings. Reeve was a near unanimous choice, with Connecticut's Stephanie White garnering the only other vote.\n\nAP WNBA poll\n\nNew York remains in the top spot in this week's AP WNBA power poll with Connecticut moving back into second. Las Vegas, Minnesota and Seattle were the next three. Indiana and Phoenix were tied for sixth. Chicago and Atlanta followed. Washington, Los Angeles and Dallas rounded out the poll.\n\nCaitlin corner\n\nClark has had double figure assists in her last three games, including a 19-point, 12-rebound and 13-assist effort against New York last Saturday. The Fever have gone 6-3 in their last nine games. Indiana has a busy upcoming week, hosting Washington and Phoenix before visiting Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nRookie watch\n\nRickea Jackson has come into her own lately. The fourth overall pick by the Los Angeles' Sparks averaged 16 points 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists last week. She had a season-best 22 points in a loss to Phoenix.\n\nScoring list\n\nTina Charles is 95 points behind Tina Thompson for second place on the WNBA all-time scoring list after the Atlanta Dream forward moved past Tamika Catchings on Sunday. Charles has scored 7,394 points in her career.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nWilson earned AP Player of the Week honors. The Aces forward averaged 27.3 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks to help Las Vegas go 3-1. Other players receiving votes included Reese and Clark.\n\nGame of the week\n\nNew York at Connecticut, Wednesday. The teams with the top records in the WNBA will meet in a matinee camp day game.

The former Iowa Hawkeyes star has constantly made WNBA history and has broken records in what seems to be every game.\n\nClark even became the first WNBA rookie ever to record a triple-double in Indiana's most recent game against the New York Liberty. But she is on track to achieve something else that no WNBA player has ever achieved before.\n\nIn 22 games with the Fever in the 2024 season, Clark is averaging 16.1 points and 7.4 assists. No other player in league history has ever recorded this stat line in one season, let alone averaged 16+ points and 7+ assists per game.

One person didn't vote.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses. It has been a complete joy for me to witness how both players have evolved as professionals in such a short amount of time in the league.\"\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District Nebo woman charged with break-in Man found dead near Lake James in McDowell County McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. She's leading the league in rebounding with 11.9 per game.\n\nThe panel also picked Las Vegas star A'ja Wilson as the unanimous choice for Player of the Year at this point in the season. Wilson felt she should have won the award last year and this year has been even more dominant. She is averaging 27.0 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nThe Aces star forward is on pace to shatter the record for average points in a season. She became the Aces' all-time scoring leader on Sunday.\n\nCheryl Reeve gets the mid-season nod for Coach of the Year. She guided the Minnesota Lynx to a Commissioner's Cup title and has the team sitting in third in the standings. Reeve was a near unanimous choice, with Connecticut's Stephanie White garnering the only other vote.\n\nAP WNBA poll\n\nNew York remains in the top spot in this week's AP WNBA power poll with Connecticut moving back into second. Las Vegas, Minnesota and Seattle were the next three. Indiana and Phoenix were tied for sixth. Chicago and Atlanta followed. Washington, Los Angeles and Dallas rounded out the poll.\n\nCaitlin corner\n\nClark has had double figure assists in her last three games, including a 19-point, 12-rebound and 13-assist effort against New York last Saturday. The Fever have gone 6-3 in their last nine games. Indiana has a busy upcoming week, hosting Washington and Phoenix before visiting Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nRookie watch\n\nRickea Jackson has come into her own lately. The fourth overall pick by the Los Angeles' Sparks averaged 16 points 5.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists last week. She had a season-best 22 points in a loss to Phoenix.\n\nScoring list\n\nTina Charles is 95 points behind Tina Thompson for second place on the WNBA all-time scoring list after the Atlanta Dream forward moved past Tamika Catchings on Sunday. Charles has scored 7,394 points in her career.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nWilson earned AP Player of the Week honors. The Aces forward averaged 27.3 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks to help Las Vegas go 3-1. Other players receiving votes included Reese and Clark.\n\nGame of the week\n\nNew York at Connecticut, Wednesday. The teams with the top records in the WNBA will meet in a matinee camp day game. They'll play once more in New York next Tuesday before taking a few weeks off before the Olympic break.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

Both of these young stars are making waves in the league by breaking records and putting up impressive stats in their debut seasons.\n\nClark made history by becoming the first rookie in the WNBA to achieve a triple-double, showcasing her incredible skills on the court. Not to be outdone, Reese also left her mark by breaking the all-time WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles, proving that she's a force to be reckoned with.\n\nInitially, Clark was seen as the frontrunner for the ROTY title, but Reese has been steadily gaining ground, making the race even more thrilling. ESPN's Elle Duncan weighed in on the competition, acknowledging the tough challenge for guards like Clark to make an immediate impact in the WNBA compared to post players. Despite this, she still leans slightly towards Clark for the award, citing the difficulty for guards to transition seamlessly into the league.\n\nDuncan expressed her thoughts on The Elle Duncan Show, saying, \"I would still maybe slightly give the edge to Caitlin... Because most WNBA players would tell you it's harder for a guard to translate right away in the W than it is for a post player.\" She added, \"Because she's going up against that aspect of it, I'll still probably give the nod to Caitlin Clark for Rookie of the Year, but I think it's going to be a great race.\"\n\nLooking at their stats, Clark is averaging 16.1 points, 7.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds per game, while Reese is not far behind with averages of 14.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per contest. The competition between these two exceptional players has certainly made this season one to remember.\n\nDespite the tight race, some like Gary Striewski believe that Clark still holds a strong position for the award. \"I don't think it should be as close as maybe people think it is gonna be,\" Striewski commented. \"We still have half the season to play. Caitlin Clark, if you just look at the numbers, it's right there.\"\n\nWith half the season still ahead, fans can expect an intense battle between these two rising stars as they continue to leave their mark on the WNBA. It's a race that's keeping everyone on the edge of their seats and adding an extra layer of excitement to an already thrilling season.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Duncan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle Duncan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5fbc6c514c55c27fdcbe0430cbca40f6/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/10/17205890308629.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

One person didn't vote.\n\n\"Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,\" said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics. \"Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses.

She just wants to win and to me, she's going to be my [WNBA] Rookie of the Year every day -- every day.\"\n\nAlthough there could be a case for Clark's game resembling Taurasi's prowess to an extent, some have grown frustrated with the rookie versus the veteran narrative.\n\nTaurasi, a 21-year veteran and three-time WNBA champ, faced pushback when she said that \"reality was coming\" for Clark -- who was still playing for Iowa in the NCAA Tournament in April -- when she entered the league.\n\nClark, 22, and Taurasi, 42, shared a few moments on the court during their first career matchup, when the Fever beat the Mercury at Footprint Center on June 30 -- dubbed the \"The GOAT\" vs. \"The Rook.\"\n\nSides also explained that the Fever's chemistry and pace have evolved this season as the team improved to 9-13 over the weekend.\n\n\"She found her rhythm tonight,\" Sides said of Clark. \"The timing for our players is getting better every game... now that chemistry is there, that timing is there and that's going to keep getting better.\"\n\nClark finished with 19 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds in 38 minutes of play in Saturday's win against the 17-4 Liberty, who are tied with the Sun for the top spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nClark was modest when asked about her historic night.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just happy we won,\" she said in a postgame press conference. \"I take a lot of pride in being able to do a lot of different things for this team... Obviously 13 assists, that means my teammates made 13 shots off my passes, so that goes to them. But I mean, I don't know... I don't know what to say. It's great, I don't know.\"\n\nFever forward Aliyah Boston, who was the No. 1 pick by Indiana in the 2023 WNBA Draft, chimed in with: \"She's so humble isn't she?\n\nClark currently leads all WNBA rookies in points this season with 16.1 per game, and she is the rookie leader in assists, averaging 7.4 per game.\n\nReese -- the No. 7 overall pick by the Sky in the draft -- made WNBA history with a record 13th consecutive double-double in Chicago's 84-71 loss to the Storm on Sunday.\n\nThe former college basketball rivals helped increase attendance and television ratings after Reese and LSU beat Clark and the Hawkeyes in the 2023 NCAA Women's National Championship game.\n\nTheir celebrity carried over to the pro level and the WNBA has seen a massive spike in attendance and ratings -- so much so, that multiple teams have moved venues for games to accommodate fans.\n\nClark and Reese will play on the same team for the first time when the 2024 WNBA All-Star game tips off in Phoenix on July 20.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score":

I mean, I know so many fans are going to come out to watch both of us, but I know a lot of people are just going to be able to come to Phoenix.\"\n\nThe rivals made history together as the first pair of WNBA rookies to be selected to the All-Star Game.\n\nREAD: 'Caitlin Clark Effect' Evident In WNBA All-Star Voting\n\n\"I'm sure it's already sold out,\" she added, \"so being able to be in that environment, we're going to be playing together for a while.

Her streak has also stirred a sentiment among critics that Reese is the preferred pick for ROTY behind closed doors.\n\nAs for the All-Star Game, Clark's skill set, leading all rookies in scoring and assists, should blend well with Reese. Reese will also have her shot of outshining her teammate after catching recent criticism for her double-double streak.\n\nSome may believe the pressure is too great on Reese and Clark to be rivals.

During an 83-78 victory over the New York Liberty on July 6, she recorded the first-ever triple-double by a rookie in the WNBA. Her Fever teammate, Kelsey Mitchell, shared her honest reaction to the triple-double, dropping a blunt response to the WNBA record.\n\nMitchell explained that she wasn't surprised by Clark's feat after watching her wreak havoc with the Iowa Hawkeyes the past four years in college.\n\n\"I was playing the game. I don't know what you want me to say... I'm honestly not surprised. I mean, I think if you guys have seen her do it for an accumulation of four years, I don't think it would be too difficult at the pro level,\" Mitchell said.\n\nClark's final stat line against the Liberty was 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds.\n\nDuring her legendary career with the Hawkeyes, Clark averaged 28.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.1 rebounds per game. She ended her career with Iowa as the NCAA's all-time leading scorer for men's and women's basketball, scoring 3,951 points from 2020-2024.\n\nClark has proved her game can translate to the professional level despite shooting 39.3% from the field. The rookie is averaging 16.1 points and 7.4 assists per game, leading all first-year players in both categories.\n\nMitchell and Clark have produced one of the best backcourt duos in the WNBA, as both players are headed to the league All-Star game on July 20 in Phoenix. The Ohio State alum has averaged 16.5 points in her seventh season with the Fever.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark And Sabrina Ionescu's Pregame Exchange Is Turning Heads\n\nRelated: Aliyah Boston's Postgame Message To Caitlin Clark Goes Viral After Fever-Liberty", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/ba/cbad25b1-0c9c-595b-b493-fd4edd262448/668e78919c85f.image.jpg?crop=1068%2C561%2C0%2C119&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 304, "textEnd": 310}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1610, "textEnd": 1617}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Of the 43 games studied, nine involved the Fever -- and the five most-bet games featured Indiana as an opponent.\n\nClark's effect on sports betting seems to be one that trickles down, as games in the study that did not involve the Fever showed a 162% increase in bet count over the baseline duel.\n\n\"Even before Caitlin Clark became the first rookie in WNBA history to record a triple-double in her July 6 game against the New York Liberty, her presence has been a major factor in boosting betting activity,\" Optimove Vice President of Marketing Rony Vexelman said in a press release. \"She highlights the importance of star power in driving fan engagement and betting interest.

Reese is amassing counting stats at a very high rate, even setting the WNBA record for consecutive games with a double-double (13).\n\nThat's not the WNBA rookie record - that's the overall record previously set by Candace Parker back in 2009 and 2010 (12). It's impressive, for sure, but it doesn't really tell the whole story.\n\nThe problem is that many of Reese's rebounds come on her own missed layups. In fact, Reese only makes 44% of her layups. She's attempted 185 layups this season and 40 of them have been blocked.\n\nThat's not a strong figure for someone who is often called one of the best post players in the league, despite being a rookie.\n\nPlus, if she were really as strong in the post as some people would like you to believe, wouldn't she have more blocked shots of her own?\n\nReese has blocked seven opponent shots this season, less than one block for every two games she has played. For reference, Caitlin Clark has 17 blocks this season. Clark is a guard who is four inches shorter than Reese.\n\nReese ranks outside the Top 40 in the league in blocks per game, which again, doesn't scream \"disruptive interior presence.\" (Clark ranks 16th in this stat.)\n\nReese's offensive efficiency doesn't paint a pretty picture for the Sky rookie. She's shooting just 42% from the field this season, despite the fact that 85% of her shot attempts come from inside eight feet.\n\nJust 18 of her made field goals this season have come from outside the \"restricted area.\" For comparison, Clark has made only 31 shots from inside the restricted area, with the majority of her made shots coming from 20+ feet away from the basket.\n\nDespite an average field goal depth being much farther from the basket, Clark is only slightly worse than Reese at converting shots (39.3% FG vs. 41.8% FG).\n\nThe biggest difference between the two players is in their effective field goal percentage. Clark is over 50% in that category and Reese is at just 42%.\n\nThis is not to simply disparage Angel Reese, who is still a very good basketball player and especially good for a rookie. She's a competitor who is unafraid of banging down low with the biggest girls in the WNBA.\n\nShe seems to play her best when the stakes are the highest. Those are signs of an elite athlete.\n\nReese also frequently puts herself in a good position once shots go up, which is part of the reason she's able to secure so many rebounds.\n\nHowever, she just isn't very skilled. Reese doesn't dribble well, can't shoot at all, and isn't a great defender. No disrespect to her, but Caitlin Clark is unlike anything we've ever seen in women's basketball.\n\nAs Dan Dakich said on his OutKick show on Tuesday, \"Caitlin Clark does things on the basketball court that other WNBA players have never even thought of doing.\"\n\nReese, on the other hand, is just like the majority of post players that have come through the league over the past 25 years. She takes the majority of her shots from inside 5 feet and misses a lot of them. She gets rebounds because she's always near the basket.\n\nAnd for those people who argue that Reese is making her team better than Clark is making her team, that's absurd.\n\nThe Indiana Fever won 13 games last season. They're on pace to better that total this season and the only major addition was Clark.\n\nThe Chicago Sky, on the other hand, added both Reese and Kamilla Cardoso (the #3 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft).

Where it gets contentious is in deciding which of the two first-year players is better.\n\nSome have used the player efficiency rating (PER) to decide the matter. It's an advanced stat developed by former Memphis Grizzlies executive John Hollinger, who is now a senior NBA columnist for The Athletic.\n\nReese has a higher PER than Clark by a significant margin. The Sky forward owns a 19.8 PER through 22 games, while Clark only has a 15.7 over the same number of games played.\n\nVia Clark Report:\n\n\"PER (player efficiency rating) is an advanced stat that has been used to argue Caitlin Clark should not be WNBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nAcross the top 14 all time highest NBA PER ratings, 0 were point guards.\n\nAcross the top 25 all time highest WNBA PER ratings, 1 was a point guard.\"\n\nHowever, Clark's supporters have tried to put the use of PER in perspective, as they believe it's unfair to make that stat the sole arbitrator in settling the Clark vs. Reese debate.\n\nOne fan protests, \"They use these weird stats no one has ever heard of that favor bigs to make their case! [It's their] only way to create their narrative.\"\n\nAnother X user posts in disagreement, saying \"anybody who uses that stat (PER) seriously needs to be ignored.\"\n\n\"PER has always been a big person stat. Caitlin was top 3 last season at Iowa and was the only guard in the top 5,\" said another Clark supporter.\n\nAnother X user who criticizes the PER called the NBA and WNBA \"biased in favor of 'average' post players.\" The same user went on to say Clark shouldn't just be the Rookie of the Year winner but also an ESPY award winner for \"impacting women's sports, like we've never witnessed before.\"\n\nOne fan blatantly calls the PER \"one of the worst metrics for efficiency.\"\n\n\"Fake made up stat,\" said another Clark fan.\n\nThere is still plenty of basketball left to play this season, though.

She's such a positive light in our locker room.\n\n\"She has a great voice, she's always there, whether things are great or things aren't as great. She's just a very consistent person in our locker room. She's been someone who's been really helpful throughout my rookie year, having gone through it just a year ago.\"\n\nBoston was the WNBA Rookie of the Year last season, averaging 14.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.3 steals per game. With the addition of Clark to the roster, many believe the Fever have the guard-post combination to develop into one of the best teams in the league at some point down the road.\n\nThere have been some rough patches through the first half of the season, but Clark says her chemistry with Boston is getting better as the season continues.\n\n\"I think you can tell our chemistry is really coming along,\" Clark said. \"A lot of that has been developed through games. So, the more practice we get together, the better it's going to get.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3634,h_2044,x_0,y_241/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01j2edcyc20ywvc43ww4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

And her triple-double -- the first by a rookie in the league's 28-year history -- is no small feat. It's not simply that first-year players haven't done it. Few players of any experience level have reached the mark in the WNBA.\n\nAnd it's that stat-packing the Fever need to keep winning this year, not Clark scoring a bunch of points to lead them offensively. At Iowa, the Hawkeyes won all 17 games she notched a triple-double; when she scored at least 40, they went 9-4. Most of those nine wins came later in her collegiate career when she could do both surrounded by teammates who knew each other's tendencies.\n\nThe rookie flirted with triple-doubles in the games leading up to Saturday. She fell one rebound short against Phoenix during the Fever's first win over a team with at least a .500 record. She was four rebounds short against Las Vegas and it was the same at Chicago in late June. Against Washington, it was four assists. And in a prior game against Chicago, she fell two rebounds and one assist shy.\n\n\"Obviously, it's cool,\" Clark said of the triple-double she reached with 7:07 still to play against New York. \"My teammates have been finishing the ball [at a] really, really high rate. My assist numbers, that's because of them.\"\n\nShe's averaging 11.2 assists over her last five games, all but one against teams in the top half of the standings (Liberty, Aces, Mercury, Storm and the Sky are in eighth). She's averaging 7.4 assists on the season. Her 15.8 scoring average in those five games is in line with her season average. The triple-double was the first in the WNBA's 38 total triple-doubles in its history to come against a team with the league's best record.\n\nUntil a couple of years ago, a triple-double was a rare feat. Alyssa Thomas leaped into MVP consideration last year largely because of her historic numbers and near triple-double stat line. Clark became the 17th player to record one. It is hard to do because games are shorter than in the NBA (40 minutes to 48), and because it takes a team-wide effort. Teammates have to knock down shots, which the Fever are doing at an increasing rate of late, and clear room for Clark to rebound and trigger the transition offense.\n\nClark's name goes down in the record book, but this is a Fever feat the fans who continue to sell out Gainbridge Fieldhouse should be excited to see for the future. (And they are.) Improvement will come, and that's more illustrative with wins than by pouring in points.\n\nClark is the only rookie in WNBA history to average at least 10 points, five rebounds and five assists as of Monday, per Across the Timeline. Six players have done it at any point in their careers. Candace Parker didn't do it until her eighth season. New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu, whose first games in the league track similarly to Clark's, did it in her second through fourth seasons. Ionescu is the active collegiate triple-double leader in both women's and men's NCAA Division I. Thomas is in her third consecutive season of doing it. She's currently averaging 11.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 7.9 assists in her 11th season. She holds the WNBA record with 13 triple-doubles.\n\nWe're tracking Clark's numbers in comparison with Candace Parker, who was the only WNBA rookie to be named league MVP.\n\nSeason averages: Points (FG%/3FG%/FT%), rebounds, assists (turnovers), steals, blocks\n\nAdvanced stats: Player efficiency rating; offensive/defensive rating (via Her Hoop Stats); true shooting percentage, win shares per 40; plus/minus\n\nNotable league rankings: Clark continues to remain top 10 in many offensive totals because she's played more games than nearly every other player. She ranks fourth in assists per game behind Alyssa Thomas (8.5), Natasha Cloud (7.6) and Jackie Young (7.0), and sixth in assist percentage (33.2%). But she ranks ninth in assists per 40 minutes (7.4).\n\nShe ranks 15th in scoring, 31st in rebounds, 18th in steals and 21st in blocks through Tuesday night. Her 27.7% usage rate remains top 10 and she leads the league in free-throw rate at 32.1%.\n\nNotable league rankings (full season): Parker led the league in rebounding as a rookie, finished fifth in scoring and 17th in assists per game. Those remain among the best numbers of her career. The advanced stats ranked top five across the board with the exception of her 11th-best offensive rating. She was named Player of the Week once in August.\n\nEvery couple of weeks we'll compare Clark to another rookie in history based on one statistical category comparison.\n\nIt's time for the Sue Bird comparison.\n\nClark passed a few Bird marks over the weekend. Clark became the fastest player in league history to reach 350 points and 150 assists, doing so in her 22nd game to Bird's 25th. And she overtook the most double-doubles with assists mark for a rookie, reaching four to Bird's three. That record will likely balloon with an entire half of a regular season left to play and nearly all of the Fever able to practice together during the Olympic break later this month.\n\nBird's career is illustrious and well-told at this point largely as a result of the recent rise in interest in the WNBA overlapping her final seasons. The former UConn point guard became synonymous with Seattle when the Storm drafted her No. 1 overall in 2002. She stayed there her entire 19-year career and won four WNBA championships in three different decades. She's all over the record books, ranking first in career assists (3,234), fourth in average assists (5.6) and fifth in assist percentage (32.5).\n\nAs a rookie tasked with leading a franchise playing its third season, Bird averaged 14.4 points (17th), 2.6 rebounds (91st), 6 assists (second) and 1.7 steals (8th). She averaged 3.4 turnovers and shot 40% from 3.

The former LSU star has tallied the most consecutive double-doubles in league history.\n\nClark and Reese are the overwhelming candidates for Rookie of the Year. However, Los Angeles Sparks forward Rickea Jackson is another player to watch as one of the most efficient first-year players thus far.\n\nHere are the latest CBS Sports WNBA Rookie Rankings:\n\n1. Caitlin Clark Caitlin Clark IND * G * #22 16.1 PPG, 7.4 APG, 6.0 RPG View Profile\n\nClark became the first rookie in WNBA history to record a triple-double when the Fever upset the New York Liberty 83-78 on Saturday. Clark's historic achievement happened in the form of 19 points, 12 rebounds and 13 assists.\n\nBeating the Liberty is not an easy task, as New York has the best record in the WNBA. Clark became Division I college basketball's all-time leading scorer earlier this year, and now she is impacting the Fever with those same skills. Against the Liberty, Clark scored or assisted on 46 of the Fever's 83 points. It was the fourth consecutive game in which the former Iowa star was responsible for at least half the Fever's points.\n\n2. Angel Reese Angel Reese CHI * F * #5 14.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 1.5 SPG View Profile\n\nReese registered her 13th consecutive double-double Monday against the Seattle Storm, officially breaking Candace Parker's record across multiple seasons. She tallied 17 points on 53.3% shooting to go along with 14 rebounds, four steals and a block.\n\nReese is currently leading the WNBA in rebounds with 11.9 per game, one more than Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson. She is also leading her team with 1.5 steals per game, the 12th-best mark in the league.\n\n3. Rickea Jackson Rickea Jackson LAS * F * #2 10.9 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 45.3% FG View Profile\n\nJackson's playing time increased this past week, and the former Tennessee star took advantage of it by continuing to show how efficient she can be. Jackson has scored in double digits and collected at least five rebounds per contest in her last four games.\n\nJackson struggled with shooting in 41 minutes against the Aces on Friday, going 5-for-17 from the field, but she still hit three 3-pointers on her way to 14 points in the 98-93 overtime victory. Jackson bounced back from her shooting woes by registering a career-high 22 points on 47% from the field in a loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday.\n\n4. Kamilla Cardoso Kamilla Cardoso CHI * C * #10 8.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 1.1 BPG View Profile\n\nCardoso knows how to use her 6-foot-7 size to her advantage while also putting in the work. She is constantly on double-double watch as she continues to be the best rebounder on the Sky behind Angel Reese. Her defensive efforts are also paying off as she is in the top 10 in the WNBA in steals per game.\n\n\"She's getting the looks. Now it's about finishing,\" Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon said Sunday. \"It's about getting the position you want, getting to your spots and finding it. It's about strength and power under the basket, with the way post players are today. Getting to your spot, getting your base, and finishing with power.\"\n\n5. Aaliyah Edwards Aaliyah Edwards WAS * F * #24 8.6 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 0.9 BPG View Profile\n\nThe former UConn forward could do better when it comes to staying out of foul trouble, but she is another player who could be a consistent double-digit scorer as her career progresses. Despite averaging around 23 minutes in 19 games, she is putting up a solid 8.6 points and 6.0 boards per contest.\n\nIn her last outing, Edwards scored 10 points while going 4-for-6 from the field, adding two rebounds and a steal in 21 minutes against a tough Minnesota Lynx team.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She leads all rookies in points scored and assists per game.\n\nClark was slightly ahead of Chicago's Angel Reese in the Rookie of the Year battle until Clark went nuclear on Sunday, becoming the first-ever WNBA rookie to record a triple-double. Clark accomplished the feat in a win over the league-best New York Liberty, which was an exclamation on her triumph.\n\nClark's early career excellence is drawing comparisons to all-time greats, such as 21-year veteran and three-time WNBA champ Diana Taurasi.\n\nFever coach Christie Sides reflected on Sunday's 83-78 win and Clark's case for Rookie of the Year before comparing Clark to Taurasi.\n\nIt was a major name-drop by the Fever coach.\n\nSides said, \"I'm always going to make a case for my players. First and foremost, she is the most competitive human being I've ever met. I really compare her to Diana Taurasi.\"\n\nSure, Christie Sides can vie for her players, but there's truth behind the coach's statement.\n\nThe coach added, \"She's always looking to find ways to get better. 'How can I help the team? What can we do?' ... But she just wants to win. She just wants to win and to me, she's going to be my [WNBA] Rookie of the Year every day -- every day.\"\n\nDiana Taurasi, 42, is widely recognized as a top-10 WNBA player all-time, landing on some fans' Mount Rushmore alongside names like Maya Moore, Sheryl Swoopes and Tamika Catchings. The 11-time All-Star, two-time WNBA Finals MVP and three-time champ still plays in the league, averaging 16.6 points per game for the Phoenix Mercury.\n\nThe resume battle between Taurasi and Clark tilts heavily toward the vet and given all the criticism Clark has faced this year; it wouldn't be surprising to see the rookie face backlash for being compared to Taurasi.\n\nStill, Clark has demonstrated all the skills necessary to compete at Taurasi's level and surpass her as the greatest WNBA player ever.\n\nREAD: Chicago Sky Take Shady Shot At Caitlin Clark After Historic Triple-Double\n\nIs the comparison really that extreme? Some may say it's not.\n\nBeyond her play, Clark is already hailed as the WNBA's most entertaining player, selling out venues unlike any season before.\n\nBefore the season, Diana Taurasi commented on the incoming Caitlin Clark phenomenon. The vet predicted a \"learning curve\" for the college ball sensation and all-time NCAA women's basketball scoring leader entering her rookie year. Taurasi had no idea that by the All-Star break, Clark would generate so much excitement that people would start making comparisons.\n\nThanks to Clark's impact, the gears are beginning to turn for the surging Indiana Fever (9-13).\n\nThe two players clashed in a sold-out Footprint Center crowd on June 30, and Clark's Indiana Fever had the last laugh with an 88-82 win.\n\nTo this point, there has been good-hearted competition between Clark and Taurasi. While Caitlin battles Angel Reese as her on-court rival, the Indiana rookie maintains a 'game recognizes game' relationship with Taurasi.\n\nCaitlin Clark and the Fever welcome Taurasi and the Mercury for a rematch on Friday (July 12).", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alejandro_avila@outkick.com", "name": "Alejandro Avila", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maya Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Swoopes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Swoopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/joe-biden-clay-travis_2-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 2904, "textEnd": 2911}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 3284, "textEnd": 3291}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The 22-year-old is averaging 16.1 points, 6.0 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game through her first 22 WNBA contests.\n\nClark's efforts have helped Indiana surge into the playoff picture following a miserable 1-8 start. Having won six of their last nine games, the Fever (9-13) occupy the seventh seed and are only 2.5 games behind the Phoenix Mercury for the No. 6 spot.\n\nBut as noted by the @CClarkReport X/Twitter account, the widely-used player efficiency rating (PER) advanced statistic suggests that Caitlin Clark shouldn't even be the WNBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since Clark is the overwhelming favorite to win the honors at practically about every sportsbook. The stats don't lie, after all.\n\nFans on X/Twitter wasted no time exposing the statistic while defending Caitlin Clark:\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Caitlin Clark Had Surprising Reaction After Finding Out She'll Be Angel Reese's Teammate\n\nFormer Memphis Grizzlies VP of basketball operations John Hollinger, now a writer at The Athletic, designed the PER stat. As ESPN outlines it, PER is \"the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production.\"\n\nFew advanced statistics in the sporting world draw more outcry and debate than PER in basketball. And Caitlin Clark's incredible rookie season is just another compelling case that the formula for PER is far from perfect.\n\nAt the end of the day, one just has to look at how much the team has improved with Clark this season. They went 13-27 a year ago and failed to win double-digit games in each of the three years prior.\n\nIndiana last made the postseason in 2016, albeit with a 17-17 record that culminated with a first round loss at the hands of Phoenix. Indiana hasn't topped 13 wins in a season since 2017, yet Clark has them on track to easily surpass that number here in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Player efficiency rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hollinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Hollinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2160576088-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Over the last few days, Clark and Reese put up remarkable performances - historic even - to help their chances of winning the award.\n\nLast Saturday, Clark recorded the first-ever triple-double by a rookie during an Indiana Fever upset win against the New York Liberty. Then on Sunday, Reese set a new WNBA record for longest streak of double-doubles, albeit in a loss to the Seattle Storm.\n\nFor FOX Sports' Rachel Nichols, Clark is in the lead in the race for the Rookie of the Year honor.\n\n\"To me, Caitlin Clark is the Rookie of the Year right now. She has impacted winning in a bigger way than anyone else in this rookie class,\" Nichols said during Monday's edition of Undisputed.\n\n\"She leads all rookies in four or five of the stat categories, and her team is on pace to finish a lot better this year than it did last year, meaning she has impacted the overall state of the team, whereas Angel Reese's Sky right now are not on pace to improve.\"\n\nAs expected, fans have polarizing reactions to Nichols' take.\n\n\"One is 9-13 and the other is 8-12 stop acting like Caitlin is winning please lmaooo\"\n\n\"Rachel knows, this stat is the definition of impacting winning:\"\n\n\"Totally agree, CC is the ROTY. But Angel is a worthy 2nd place ROTY candidate. She has been incredibly impressive this year also.\"\n\n\"The hole in her argument is that Sky have one starter from last years team and are starting two rookies, while Indy has two number 1 picks in back to back years. Personally I'd go co-mvp unless one of them falls off the map.\"\n\n\"CC is just the better player period, she was the better player in college she is the better in the W\"\n\nWhat makes the debate tougher to settle is the fact that Clark and Reese don't play the same position and have different roles on their respective teams.\n\nClark needs to have the ball in her hands as a primary scorer and playmaker for her teammates, while Reese is at her best when doing work on the glass and in the shaded area. Their statistical differences need to be interpreted with the proper and objective context as opposed to merely mentioning their teams' records.\n\nRelated: Angel Reese 'Gaining' on Caitlin Clark for WNBA Rookie of the Year Vote", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rex_villas@postandcourier.com", "name": "Rex Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ad/3ada1075-14db-5726-9371-8eb1fe5b5db0/668ccc7571c80.image.jpg?crop=1071%2C562%2C0%2C118&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

And the Chicago Sky's Angel Reese, the No. 7 overall pick, set a record for consecutive double-doubles. Clark and Reese were named to the 2024 All-Star team, earning their first selection in their first year in the league.\n\nClark and Reese top USA TODAY Sports' WNBA rookie power rankings:\n\n1. Caitlin Clark, Indiana Fever\n\nStats through 22 games: 16.1 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 7.4 app, 39.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: Caitlin Clark is used to breaking records at the collegiate level, and now she's doing it in the pros. She recorded 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in the Fever's 83-78 win over the New York Liberty on Saturday to mark the WNBA's first rookie triple-double. In addition to becoming the first Fever player in franchise history to score a triple-double, Clark also became the fastest player in the league to record 350 points and 150 assists. She leads all rookies in scoring and assists.\n\n2.

Do we need to say more? Reese has recorded a double-double in 14 of her first 20 games and leads the league in offensive rebounds (97) and total rebounds (237).\n\n\"I just go out there and do my job. My job is to rebound, so I'm going to go out there and do my job and rebound. I know that's what my teammates need me to do, and I've committed to that,\" Reese said after dropping a career-high 27 points in the Sky's 88-84 win over the Storm on July 5.\n\n3. Rickea Jackson, Los Angeles Sparks\n\nStats through 21 games: 10.9 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 1.5 apg, 45.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: The Sparks may have dropped nine of their past 10 games, but Rickea Jackson has been a bright spot in Los Angeles. She dropped a career-high 22 points in the Sparks' 84-78 loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday and has reached double figures in 12 of her first 21 games. She is third in rookie scoring per game, trailing only Clark (16.1) and Reese (14.1).\n\n4. Kamilla Cardoso, Chicago Sky\n\nStats through 14 games: 8.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 1.1 bpg, 44.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: Kamilla Cardoso may have missed the first six games of the season with a shoulder injury, but the two-time NCAA champion is returning to form. She only scored six points in the Sky's 84-71 loss against the Seattle Storm on Sunday, but she was a force on the defensive side of the ball, recording a career-high four blocks, eight rebounds (all in the first quarter) and one steal. Cardoso is second in rookie blocks per game (1.1), trailing Cameron Brink (2.3), and second among rookies in rebounds per game (7.8).\n\n5. Aaliyah Edwards, Washington Mystics\n\nStats through 19 games: 8.6 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.1 apg, 48.4% FG\n\nBreakdown: Aaliyah Edwards had 10 points in the Mystics' 74-67 loss to the Minnesota Lynx on Saturday and she's the fourth leading rookie scorer per game (8.6), behind Clark, Reese and Jackson. Edwards is third in the league among rookies in total rebounds per game (6.0) and blocks per game (0.9). Edwards was also named to Canada's women's basketball team for the 2024 Paris Olympics, marking her second Olympic appearance. Despite Edwards' steady improvement, she was ranked No. 5 due to the fact that the Mystics are tied with the Dallas Wings for the worst record in the league at 5-17.\n\nNot ranked: Los Angeles Sparks' Cameron Brink is out of contention for Rookie of the Year after she suffered a torn ACL in the Sparks' 79-70 loss to the Connecticut Sun on June 18, effectively ending her season.\n\nThis article

Cardoso is second in rookie blocks per game (1.1), trailing Cameron Brink (2.3), and second among rookies in rebounds per game (7.8).\n\nBreakdown: Aaliyah Edwards had 10 points in the Mystics' 74-67 loss to the Minnesota Lynx on Saturday and she's the fourth leading rookie scorer per game (8.6), behind Clark, Reese and Jackson. Edwards is third in the league among rookies in total rebounds per game (6.0) and blocks per game (0.9). Edwards was also named to Canada's women's basketball team for the 2024 Paris Olympics, marking her second Olympic appearance. Despite Edwards' steady improvement, she was ranked No. 5 due to the fact that the Mystics are tied with the Dallas Wings for the worst record in the league at 5-17.", "source": {"uri":

After a tough start to the season, the Fever are 6-3 over their last nine games and have jumped into playoff contention.\n\nDespite the improvements, there has been one major concern that has been consistent throughout the entire season involving Clark and her teammates. The former Iowa Hawkeyes star leads the league in turnovers by a wide margin. A lot of this has to do with her teammates being unable to catch her passes.\n\nFever head coach Christie Sides recently spoke on this issue and justified this problem by complimenting Clark's incredible playmaking ability.\n\n\"She sees things as they're happening, and sometimes before the player that's gonna get the ball even realizes it. She's a hell of a passer,\" Sides said.\n\nWith the ongoing experience of playing with Clark, her teammates should start to show improvement when it comes to catching the passes Clark tosses their way. But let's be real: her teammates are not all to blame for Clark's high turnover numbers. She has made some brutal mistakes herself.\n\nThis has been an issue since day one, but there is no reason to think it won't change. Despite the drops, Clark is still second in the league in assists, averaging 7.4 per game.\n\nClark, Aliyah Boston, and Kelsey Mitchell will all represent the Fever at the 2024 WNBA All-Star game later this month, proving that they have a roster built to succeed even with their faults.\n\nRelated: Sheryl Swoopes Turns Heads After Unexpected Caitlin Clark Comment\n\nRelated: Kelsey Mitchell Reveals The Only Thing That Could Stop Indiana Fever", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristy_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristy Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Swoopes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Swoopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/69/069875bd-5229-524e-9a79-9caad2de6639/668dfbfa05099.image.jpg?crop=1120%2C588%2C0%2C106&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

However, in their next game, they revealed some weaknesses, especially in coaching, as they lost 89-84 to one of the league's worst teams, the Washington Mystics, who entered the game with a 5-17 record compared to Indiana's 9-13.\n\nAs often happens when the Fever lose, fans directed their frustration toward coach Christie Sides. In today's game against Washington, Sides' team was clearly trailing 76-55 when their star rookie, Caitlin Clark, led a spirited comeback attempt, bringing them within three points at 87-84 with less than a minute remaining.\n\nClark was the game's leading scorer with 29 points, shooting 7/14 from the field, 10/11 from free throws, and 5/9 from three-point range. She also recorded 13 assists, further cementing her role as the team's offensive engine.\n\nDespite her heroic efforts, her teammates fell short. Aaliyah Boston scored only 6 points in 21 minutes. Kelsey Mitchell, who played 38 minutes (same as Clark), added 15 points, and bench player Nalyssa Smith contributed 11 points. These three were the only Fever players to score in double digits.\n\nWhen analyzing the offensive contribution of Clark's teammates, the assist tally was disappointing. Smith had one assist, while Mitchell and Hull had two each. No one else contributed, leaving Clark as the clear offensive driver. However, as fans have repeatedly pointed out, she cannot do it all alone.\n\nClark's 29 points marked the first time she surpassed the 20-point barrier in a game since June 16, when she scored 23 against the Chicago Sky.\n\nDespite her stellar performance, the Fever squandered another valiant effort from their star rookie, who continues to position herself as the leading candidate for the WNBA Rookie of the Year award.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5d3b7961fafedae9d6ad550478e8c7ee/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/10/17206378471148.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1632, "textEnd": 1639}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Vanloo went tumbling backwards on the play, but did answer with a 3-pointer of her own at the other end of the court.\n\nBut it was in the second frame that a frustrated Clark was seen shoving her Belgian rival, who was sure to embellish the contact for officials.\n\nClark initiated the contact with Vanloo from beyond the 3-point arc while calling for the ball from teammate Erica Wheeler. Vanloo once again stumbled backwards, only this time she got right back in Clark's face as the former Iowa star continued to shoved her away.\n\nClark (22) imitates Washington Mystics guard Julie Vanloo during Wednesday's matinee\n\nA frustrated Caitlin Clark is seen pushing Julie Vanloo after a series of run-ins on Wednesday\n\nSamuelson was seen afterwards trying to calm Clark down, but the rookie guard didn't appear interested in listening in the moment.\n\nThe sellout crowd of 17,274 clearly sided with Clark, who was lucky she wasn't whistled for a foul on the play.\n\nLater, in the fourth, Clark was seen shoving Vanloo to the hardwood for one of her five fouls on the day.\n\nAlthough the Fever's comeback effort fell short, Clark played exceptionally well, scoring 29 points and adding 13 assists, five steals, five rebounds and three blocks.\n\nVanloo, meanwhile, had 13 points and a pair of assists on the game.\n\nClark currently leads Chicago Sky power forward Angel Reese in the ongoing Rookie of the Year chase, according to a national panel of voters.\n\nThe two have garnered national attention with record-setting rookie seasons -- leading to them being the first rookie duo to make an All-Star team since 2014 -- so it's no surprise that they're the leading candidates for the award.\n\nThe pair have helped the league to huge increases in ratings, attendance and merchandise sales and with so much basketball still to be played an argument can be made for either to win the award.\n\nCaitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever dribbles against Julie Vanloo of the Washington Mystics\n\nRead More Angel Reese debuts dramatic new hairstyle after cryptic post about 'never being a rebound'\n\nBut at the halfway point, the 15-member panel gives the edge to Clark in a 9-5 vote, according to The Associated Press. One person didn't vote.\n\n'Today, I would say Clark, only because they have one more win overall as a team and have a 2-1 lead head-to-head,' said voter Christy Winters-Scott, a basketball analyst for the Mystics.\n\n'Clearly this could change as the WNBA season progresses. It has been a complete joy for me to witness how both players have evolved as professionals in such a short amount of time in the league.'\n\nClark is leading the WNBA in points accounted for (points plus points off assists) with 713 according to ESPN. The Indiana Fever's No. 1 pick also became the first rookie to have a triple-double in a game doing it in a win over New York.\n\nReese set the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles with 13, passing Candace Parker's mark of 12 set across the 2009 and 2010 seasons.

From June 13 onward, Boston has turned the corner, churning out efficient performances. If the counter is that the schedule has lightened up, well, Boston had another great outing in Saturday's win over the WNBA's-best New York Liberty.\n\nClark posted the first-ever WNBA rookie triple-double Saturday. Four of the point guard's assists went to Boston. That's not unordinary per se, but Clark has assisted 53 of Boston's 79 field goals so far this season. And 17 happened in the first 13 games, while 36 have been dished out as the Fever have won six of their past nine. So what's the cause? Did this connection just need time?\n\nInherently, yes. The Clark-Boston pick-and-roll has only more recently been the effective option, while opponents have blitzed Clark less often. Back in May, it looked like most of Boston's plays were late in the shot clock, which expedited the sophomore slump for the 2023 Rookie of the Year. Now, Clark and Boston are flourishing. And so has their off-court teammate friendship.\n\n\"She's such a positive light in our locker room,\" Clark said of Boston after practice. \"She's been somebody that's been really helpful throughout my rookie year, obviously having gone through it just a year ago. I think you can tell our chemistry is really coming along. A lot of that has been developed through games, so the more practice we get together, only the better it's gonna get.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston's off-court banter and interventions\n\nClark said Tuesday that Boston is someone who will always have you covered. That's how the string of whimsical and loyal instances between them took form. Back on June 19, the Fever beat the Washington Mystics. Clark was asked about making good passes consistently deep into games. Her mind blanked after giving an instance where her pass to Boston was stolen.\n\nBoston intervened, complimented her ability, and said they're good and not to worry.\n\nClark thanked her.\n\nTwo weeks ago at Seattle, Clark fielded all postgame questions three minutes into the conference. She then urged and somewhat demanded reporters to ask questions to Boston.\n\nOn Saturday, Clark was speaking humbly about her triple-double, not always knowing how to respond. So Boston intervened and said to the group of reporters how humble Caitlin is and sarcastically said the milestone was \"pretty cool\" and \"great job sister!\" Then the other day, Boston posted an amusing work-out vlog on TikTok with her, Clark, and Katie Lou Sameulson.\n\nSamuelson joined in the scrum of reporters after Tuesday's practice at Gainbridge Fieldhouse and asked Clark if she can anticipate seeing more TikToks with Boston. Clark quipped that it remains to be seen and that she can't give away all her secrets. The instances continue. Before players talk to the media, they compete in the Fever's halfcourt shot challenge to end practice.\n\nDamiris Dantas made it first, and eventually, Clark made it too.\n\n\"You've already taken six shots!\" Boston said right after she missed.\n\nFever youngsters growing closer midway through the season\n\nWhether the Clark-Boston pick-and-roll keeps an upward trajectory for the rest of the season -- OR the Fever can sustain this last 6-3 stretch and make the playoffs, it's encouraging to see the back-to-back No. 1 picks jelling this well together. Aliyah Boston hasn't always been acclimated to the pick-and-roll system and has had to calibrate. Caitlin Clark, likewise, is converting to playing at this level.\n\nRather than that be divisive, and there's even lots to choose from: them having to adapt to each other's games, the brutal 11-game 20-day gauntlet to begin the season with only two wins, Clark often taking the media spotlight when on the road, ALL of it. It's made their relationship more rooted. It's paired with the duo looking more relaxed and confident both on and off the court.\n\nIt's best shown in their transition offense that has been unlocked and improved lately.\n\n\"She's a great voice,\" Clark said. \"She's always there whether things are great or whether things aren't as great. She's just a very consistent person in our locker room. I'm really thankful for her.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_byrne@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Byrne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damiris_Dantas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damiris Dantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-Caitlin-Clark-Aliyah-Boston-bond-coincides-with-Fever-rise.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 232}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1854, "textEnd": 1861}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Over the last few days, Clark and Reese put up remarkable performances -- historic, even -- to help their chances of winning the award.\n\nLast Saturday, Clark recorded the first triple-double by a rookie during the Indiana Fever's upset win against the New York Liberty. On Sunday, Reese set a WNBA record for longest streak of double-doubles, albeit in a loss to the Seattle Storm.\n\nFor Fox Sports' Rachel Nichols, Clark is in the lead in the race for the Rookie of the Year honor.\n\n\"To me, Caitlin Clark is the Rookie of the Year right now. She has impacted winning in a bigger way than anyone else in this rookie class,\" Nichols said during Monday's edition of \"Undisputed.\"\n\n\"She leads all rookies in four or five of the stat categories, and her team is on pace to finish a lot better this year than it did last year, meaning she has impacted the overall state of the team, whereas Angel Reese's Sky right now are not on pace to improve.\"\n\nAs expected, fans have polarizing reactions to Nichols' take.\n\nOne fan tells Nichols to \"stop acting like Caitlin is winning.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another fan agrees with Nichols, saying, \"Rachel knows, this stat (points) is the definition of impacting winning:\"\n\nAnother fan makes a case for Reese as a second-place Rookie of the Year candidate, saying that she has also been incredibly impressive this year.\n\nThe following X (formerly Twitter) user proposes Clark and Reese be co-winners of the award \"unless one of them falls off the map.\"\n\nAnother X user firmly declared Clark the better player.\n\nWhat makes the debate tougher to settle is the fact Clark and Reese don't play the same position and have different roles on their respective teams.\n\nClark needs to have the ball in her hands as a primary scorer and playmaker for her teammates, while Reese is at her best when doing work on the glass and in the shaded area. Their statistical differences need to be interpreted in the proper and objective context, as opposed to merely mentioning their teams' records.", "source": {"uri": "athlonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Athlon Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rex_villas@athlonsports.com", "name": "Rex Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Rookie_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Rookie of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://athlonsports.com/.image/t_share/MjA3NzE4OTU2OTE0NDUyNDUz/usatsi_8464583_168410697_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

This will be the second meeting between these two teams this year.\n\nFor some reason, the WNBA decided to schedule the game at noon ET on a weekday. Many fans will be at work and won't be able to watch the matchup.\n\nThe Fever and Mystics matchup is not the only game impacted by this change in schedule. Three other games scheduled on the same day, including teams that featured the Chicago Sky, New York Liberty and Las Vegas Aces, were also scheduled to commence during working hours.\n\nSome think the reasoning behind this weird WNBA schedule is due to the Team USA vs. Canada men's basketball pre-Olympics scrimmage that starts at 10:30 p.m. ET, but the league easily could have scheduled games around that so as not to conflict with their fans' work hours.\n\nFans are not happy with the WNBA's scheduling decision and made sure they knew about it on social media.\n\nAfter a 3-10 start to the season, the Fever have improved to 9-13 after winning six of their last nine games.

The arena in Phoenix July 20 will undoubtedly feature plenty of Red, White, and Blue. Yet, many attendees at the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game are expected to favor Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese's squad of all-stars over the USA team bound for the Summer Games in Paris.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic team typically showcases the country's best players. But the WNBA All-Star team is more intriguing with Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese playing together on the same squad.\n\nSome might call it a rivalry, the evolution of a seed planted when the two first met on the national stage in the 2023 NCAA Women's Basketball Final where Ms. Reese and Louisiana State defeated Ms. Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes. It renewed again in the 2024 national semifinals where Iowa defeated LSU before losing the championship game to South Carolina.\n\nYet, their first half-season in the WNBA is evolving into more of a partnership that has maintained attention on their teams, their league as well as themselves. Ms. Clark, the first overall pick by the Indiana Fever, and Ms. Reese, the 7 overall choice by the Chicago Sky, enter the All-Star Game having validated the hype surrounding them, setting WNBA records in the process. It's why the crowd will cheer for them in Phoenix instead of Team USA.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been her teammate before, even in USA Basketball,\" Ms. Clark said of teaming up with Ms. Reese. \"I know people will be really excited about it.\"\n\nThey've earned the attention. Ms. Clark became the first rookie in league history to record a triple-double in an 83-78 upset of league-leading New York Liberty last weekend, while Ms. Reese set a new mark for consecutive double-double games with her 13 in an 84-71 loss to the Seattle Storm.\n\nAveraging 14.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per game, Ms. Reese is quickly establishing herself as one of the best post players in the league. The Sky, after an early slump of six losses in seven games, have shown improvement with four wins in their last seven outings before a Wednesday game against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"Coming into this league, so many people doubted me and didn't think my game would translate and I wouldn't be the player that I was in college or better or would be worse and wouldn't be where I am right now,\" Ms. Reese told reporters recently. \"But I trusted the process and I believed and I'm thankful that I was able to come to Chicago. I can't thank my teammates and my coaches enough for just believing in me and trusting me.\"\n\nMs. Clark has dealt with the constant scrutiny she has received by staying focused on improving her play and her team. She is averaging 16.1 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game for the Fever, who began the season 1-8 but have won six of their last nine. She has endured a rash of turnovers, hard fouls, and verbal jabs from critics without showing frustration or verbal retaliation.\n\n\"We're definitely playing some good basketball,\" Ms. Clark said ahead of Wednesday night's game against the Washington Mystics. \"We're definitely finding some confidence with what we're being able to do out there on the court. We're playing together better.\"\n\nA growing debate is which player will be voted Rookie of the Year. It's a conversation that only benefits the WNBA and their respective teams.\n\nSome have compared their \"rivalry\" to when Larry Bird and Magic Johnson entered the NBA in the 1980s. It's a valid comparison. The two men first met in the 1979 NCAA Championship when Mr. Johnson's Michigan State team beat Mr. Bird and Indiana State. They squared off again in the 1984 NBA Finals where Mr. Bird helped the Boston Celtics defeat Mr. Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games. The NBA's popularity soared from there.\n\nMs. Clark and Ms. Reese are on a similar path at a time when social media creates even more attention. From sold-out crowds to record television ratings, the WNBA is relishing its unprecedented growth.\n\nWith Ms. Clark and Ms. Reese on the same team for the first time, the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game becomes a must-watch event with Team USA serving as the spoiler.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She was trapped on 10 of them. Such defensive attention has been the norm for the No. 1 overall pick, who has spent the first half of her rookie season trying to adjust to the professional game while being guarded like one of the best players in the WNBA.\n\n\"It's a women's game now,\" Fever veteran Erica Wheeler said. \"It's not college anymore. We're a lot faster and stronger... In the beginning she struggled a little bit because she didn't know what the physicality was like, but now she knows. She's reading the game way better, and as you can see the numbers don't lie.\"\n\nThrough 22 games, Clark is averaging 16.1 points, 6.0 rebounds and 7.4 assists, which would make her the fourth player -- and first rookie -- with a 15/5/5 season. She leads all rookies in scoring and assists, is second in the league in the latter category, and needed just 20 games to set the Fever's rookie assist record. Recently, she became the first rookie ever to record a triple-double.\n\nClark can truly do it all on the offensive end, but while her long-range 3-point shooting is her \"super power,\" as Steph Curry put it earlier this year, her playmaking is arguably the most exciting aspect of her game.\n\n\"She sees things as they're happening and sometimes before the player that's gonna get the ball even realizes it,\" Fever coach Christie Sides said, adding that she's a \"hell of a passer.\"\n\nMost of Clark's facilitation comes out of the pick-and-roll, which accounts for over 50% of her possessions. She's running 14.1 of them per game, which is second only to Sabrina Ionescu, and tied for the most by any rookie in the last decade.\n\nDue to her unique gifts, opponents often choose to send multiple defenders Clark's way in order to, in Chicago Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon's words, \"get that ball out of her hands as quick as we possibly can to allow other people to make decisions.\" Through Clark's first 20 games, she had been blitzed 89 times in the pick-and-roll, per Second Spectrum, which was nearly double that of the next highest player (Ionescu, 46).\n\nThe level of pressure that Clark is dealing with is so unique that even Wheeler, who twice led the WNBA in total pick-and-rolls, has struggled at times to instruct her younger teammate. \"Nobody plays me how they play her,\" Wheeler said. \"It's a unique situation because literally they trap her at halfcourt. I've never had that.\"\n\nThe Fever have relied heavily on their male practice squad to help Clark adapt to the increased athleticism and strength of opponents, running as many reps as possible when they get the opportunity. It's no surprise that Clark has looked more comfortable ever since their outrageous opening stretch of 11 games in 20 days came to an end, and she feels her reads have \"definitely gotten better.\"\n\nAs Clark has settled in, so too have her teammates, who have also had to acclimate to a heavy pick-and-roll system. None more so than Aliyah Boston, a predominantly back-to-the-basket center throughout her career. Boston's 49 possessions as a roller through 22 games are nearly as many as her 63 all of last season. And that only includes instances where she took a shot, got fouled or turned it over, not those where she kept the ball moving.\n\nClark has delivered 53 of Boston's 79 assisted field goals, which is the most common connection on the team. Notably, just 17 of those assists happened in the team's first 13 games, while 36 have come during their recent 6-3 stretch.\n\nDuring a recent Q&A on social media, Boston was asked about her favorite play to run with Clark. Her response was not surprising: \"Any type of ballscreen action because she always makes a great read.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at some of the numbers on the Clark-Boston pick-and-roll during this recent turnaround, in which the Fever have picked up wins over the Mercury and Liberty.\n\nPossessions: 65Points: 63PPP: 0.969 (Equivalent to the second-most efficient offense in the league)Quality shots: 49Turnovers: 11\n\nBoston has grown more comfortable as a roller, whether that's finishing at the rim on a deep roll...\n\n... or making a decision as a passer on a short roll.\n\nAs Clark, Boston and the Fever have figured out how to handle blitzing defenses, teams have started to dial back that approach. That, in turn, has given Clark more freedom to make plays herself, whether that's pulling up for 3...\n\n... or driving to the basket.\n\nAt some point in the near future, the Clark-Boston pick-and-roll will be the best play in basketball. That day might come sooner than we all think.\n\n\"The chemistry and getting to play with one another, you kinda get on the same page with your minds,\" Clark said.\n\nThe one major negative for Clark so far is turnovers. She leads the league by a wide margin at 5.5 per game, which would be the worst mark ever. Interestingly, only 45 of Clark's 122 giveaways have come from pick-and-roll situations, even though those account for over half of her offensive possessions.\n\n\"I think for myself there's a difference between a good turnover and a bad turnover,\" Clark said. \"So you go back and watch and it's a good pass to make and maybe it just hit off her hands wrong and went out of bounds or maybe the defender got a little tip of the ball.\"\n\nClark will likely always be among the leaders in turnovers due to how much she controls the offense, but there's not much long-term concern in that department. Rookie point guards have always struggled with taking care of the ball, and none of them have been the No. 1 name on the scouting report.\n\nDespite a brilliant start to her career, Clark was a controversial final cut from Team USA's roster and will not be on the plane to Paris for the Olympics. The upside is that after she gets back from the All-Star Game with Boston and Kelsey Mitchell, she'll be able to enjoy her first real break since last summer, and the Fever will get a de facto second training camp with their entire roster.\n\nHalfway through her rookie season, Clark is arguably the best point guard in the league, and at the rate she's improving, there may not be any debate once play resumes after the Olympic break. Already, she's scored or assisted on more points (713) than any other player.\n\nAs Wheeler said, \"numbers don't lie.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

The chemistry between these three has improved drastically over the course of the season, and it's starting to show.\n\nOn Tuesday, during Indiana's media availability, Mitchell spoke about the confidence this team has and revealed the only thing that could stop them is themselves.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can keep cultivating that. That energy and that confidence can carry you in a lot of ways, and I think that if we can keep utilizing the work and what you guys see behind the scenes and go on and win games like this, I think it will cultivate an unbelievable culture. I don't think too much could stop us. It would only be us that could stop us at that point,\" Mitchell said.\n\nMitchell played college ball for the Ohio State Buckeyes.

Fans have been absolutely spoiled by some tremendous basketball from Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and the 2024 rookie class.\n\nBut the veterans are still hanging around and players like A'ja Wilson and Napheesa Collier continue to demonstrate why they are some of the best in the world.\n\nFantastic athletes deserve recognition, and we cannot go into the forthcoming Olympic break without mentioning players who are truly in a league of their own.\n\nLet's dive into For The Win's six WNBA mid-season awards:\n\nAll odds via BetMGM\n\nMost Valuable Player: A'ja Wilson, Las Vegas Aces\n\nThe MVP Candidate pool is A'ja Wilson, a HUGE drop-off, and then everybody else.\n\nThis is no disrespect to Napheesa Collier, who is having a mind-bogglingly good season, but A'ja Wilson still has THAT one fourth-place vote on her mind, and I feel sorry for whatever poor souls are on the other end of her current MVP campaign.\n\nWilson is currently averaging a (WNBA-best) 27 points and 11 rebounds per game game on 52.6% shooting. She is also among the top five in rebounds, steals and blocks. EXCUSE ME, A'JA WILSON?!\n\nA'ja won the WNBA MVP award in 2020 and 2022, and I fear the competition is COOKED for 2024. Go ahead and pack it up.\n\nDefensive Player of the Year: Napheesa Collier, Minnesota Lynx\n\nThe Defensive Player of the Year is another category in which A'ja Wilson makes such a solid case that it was hard not to put her in this spot. But there's something different about the product Napheesa Collier is putting on the floor.\n\nHer defensive effort cannot be denied, and Minnesota's defense is better for it. The Lynx not only lead the league in defensive rating, but Phee is also in the top seven or better in defensive rebounds, steals and blocks. She is also the best player in the WNBA when factoring in defensive win share percentage and defensive rating.\n\nSimply put, Collier is the engine behind Minnesota's defensive identity.\n\nRookie of the Year: Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese\n\nBefore either fanbase starts raging at the thought of both Caitlin Clark AND Angel Reese sharing Rooke of the Year (for now), hear me out.\n\nCaitlin Clark was off to a rousing start, winning Rookie of the Month in May and breaking records. Then, Angel Reese came storming back with Rookie of the Month in June and breaking records. Reese's ridiculous consecutive double-double streak was starting to help her pull away from Caitlin in the ROY race until Clark dropped the only rookie triple-double in WNBA history, and we're right back where we started. WHEW.\n\nThey're both BALLING at their respective positions.\n\nTo be fair, this was always going to be the case for Caitlin Clark. She's a generational talent who took a moment to adjust to the WNBA but seems to have settled down. That's typically what most people, fans included, expected of her. Record-breaking? YEP. Logo 3-point shots? YEP. Filthy assists? YEP. ALL OF THAT.\n\nBut for Reese, not many expected that she would find success in the WNBA. There were a lot of question marks related to how her game would translate and if she could make an impact against most elite professional talent. She's more than answered the doubts. Every time you think you have her figured out, she just keeps re-writing WNBA history books.\n\nAlso, let's just say the thing out loud. Post players don't typically get credit for the work they do because it's not electric like a logo three, and bigs aren't usually dishing out filthy assists at will (unless they are Alyssa Thomas).\n\nSo, the fact that a guard AND a forward are both challenging for Rookie of the Year makes this 2024 race so intriguing and so much fun. It's giving Arike Ogunbowale versus Napheesa Collier in 2019 vibes, and I'm so here for it.\n\nMost Improved Player: DiJonai Carrington, Connecticut Sun\n\nDiJonai Carrington was not a starter for the Connecticut Sun last season, and you wouldn't know that by her play.\n\nHer motor is out of this world, and she's got career highs in nearly every major category, including points, rebounds and assists. If that wasn't enough, the most impressive trait to witness this season has been her defensive prowess.\n\nCarrington has been a lockdown defender, and that's not easy to do when you're in new territory facing players you wouldn't typically guard.\n\nSixth Woman Of The Year: Chennedy Carter, Chicago Sky\n\nDespite now being a starter, Chennedy Carter still *technically* qualifies for this award as of this posting. (She's started eight games and come off the bench for 12 games.)\n\nDuring her time on the bench, she was averaging a very solid 12 points, but since being inserted in the starting lineup, Chennedy is up to nearly 22 points a game, and that's some otherworldly stuff. The Sky are 4-4 in the games she's been a starter and 4-8 in any game she came off the bench.\n\nI think that Chennedy is playing so well that she's going to play her way right out of this award, which is a very good thing.\n\nCoach of the Year: Cheryl Reeve, Minnesota Lynx\n\nLast season was not very kind to Minnesota, with injuries and a bitter exit from the playoffs.

She recorded the WNBA's first-ever triple-double by a rookie this month in the Fever's 83-78 victory over the first-place New York Liberty. Clark is averaging 16 points, six rebounds and just under 7.5 assists per game through 22 games this season.\n\nThompson told OutKick that he has been following Clark's career since her sophomore year at Iowa, adding that he has never seen this style of play in women's basketball before. He even went as far as to compare her to NBA greats Pistol Pete Maravich and Steve Nash.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's not about her race or her sexual orientation, it's about her style of play. We have never seen a woman shoot with that kind of range consistently and make the passes in the open court she does,\" Thompson said during the interview. \"Her court vision is attractive to watch as her shooting range.\"\n\nThompson, 69, was the first overall pick in the 1978 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers.

holiday loss.\n\nCollier began limping, sat down on the bench, and worked into the Lynx's lockerroom under her own power and did not return.\n\nShe finished with nine points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks.\n\nFollowing her injury, the Lynx failed to score a basket over a six-minute fourth quarter stretch, sealing their fate against the Sun.\n\nCollier's prognosis for the next three games including Sunday's marquee matchup vs. recent triple-double merchant Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever is not known, but it is expected that she will be back by next month at the latest.\n\nRelated:

But the score wasn't the big story. The massive crowd was. It was a sellout crowd of 20,366. It was the most people to watch a WNBA regular season game since 1999.\n\nThe biggest draw was Clark, the former Iowa star who plays for the Fever. Her step-back threes and scoring prowess have made her a major celebrity. This year, the Fever had more fans in Clark's first five home games than it did in 20 home games last year. Clark draws massive crowds on the road, too. The Aces usually play their home games at the 12,000-seat Michelob Ultra Arena. For this game, they played at T-Mobile Arena, which has a significantly larger capacity.\n\nClark boosted the Aces' attendance numbers for this game, but the team has done a great job drawing fans all season. They sold out their season tickets this year, the first WNBA team to do so. Last year, their average home attendance was around 9,500 fans. That's more than double their home attendance in 2019.\n\nEven this success isn't without its critics. Clark's rookie contract guarantees her less than $77,000 this year. With incentives, she could earn $500,000 or more from the WNBA. But that's a fraction of the $12.1 million that 2023 NBA No. 1 draft pick Victor Wembanyama made in his first year.\n\n\"Women in sports continue to push new boundaries and inspire us all,\" President Joe Biden tweeted about this in April. \"But right now we're seeing that even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share.\"\n\nLeave aside the irony of that complaint coming from someone who believes men should be competing in women's sports. WNBA players have long bemoaned the supposed gender pay gap.\n\nIn 2018, Aces player A'ja Wilson tweeted about NBA superstar LeBron James signing a $154 million contract. \"Must be nice. We are here looking for a [million] but Lord, let me get back in my lane,\" she wrote.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary of Title IX in 2022, then-Los Angeles Sparks forward Katie Lou Samuelson wore shoes that said, \"Pay women athletes.\"\n\nBut it's not sexism that keeps the pay of WNBA players below their NBA counterparts. It's economics. The NBA's annual revenue is more than $10 billion. In 2023, the WNBA's total was around $200 million. That was a massive jump from the $60 million it brought in 2022. Clark's inaugural season is certain to push revenues even higher. If that continues, WNBA salaries will soar, too, at least once players renegotiate their collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThis is what happened in the NBA. Lakers superstar Magic Johnson was one of the game's greatest players. He earned around $40 million in his playing career. Last season, 18 players had salaries topping $40 million. Some of those players didn't even make the All-Star team, but in one season, they earned more than Johnson did in his whole career. Even back-up players now routinely sign contracts worth more than $40 million. As the league grew in popularity, it made more money.

It appears none of the WNBA's old guard is sad she won't be in Paris.\n\nSo, pencil in Caitlin Clark for 2028. Some more veterans will be gone and Caitlin won't receive any pushback then.\n\nSeriously, if you start your team with A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart, you can probably round it out with Division III and junior college players and still earn the team's seventh consecutive gold medal. But which players are the best on the Team USA women's basketball roster?\n\n1. A'ja Wilson -- The best women's player in the world is having her best WNBA season ever. That says a lot when she's a two-time MVP and two-time champion. Wilson averaged 16.5 points and 7.3 rebounds when Team USA won the gold in 2021 in Tokyo and she's ready for big things in Paris.\n\n2. Breanna Stewart -- Back in the Olympics for the third time, \"Stewie\" averaged 15 points, 10 rebounds and 4.7 assists in Tokyo. She also is a two-time WNBA MVP and a two-time champion enjoying another solid season.\n\n3. Alyssa Thomas -- The WNBA triple-double wizard is an Olympian for the first time. She has a record 13 triple-doubles (10 regular season, three playoffs) and was MVP runner-up behind Wilson last season.\n\n4. Jewell Loyd -- The WNBA scoring leader a season ago was a spot player in Tokyo in 2021 and averaged 4.8 points. Her lone concern is shooting just 26.7 percent from 3-point range this season.\n\n5. Kahleah Copper -- Traded by the Chicago Sky to the Phoenix Mercury in the offseason, she is averaging a career-best 22.5 points, supplanting Diana Taurasi as the team's go-to scorer. This is her first Olympics for Team USA.\n\n6. Sabrina Ionescu -- Another first-time Olympian, she contributes in every area and is the top 3-point threat in the women's game. Ionescu, who gave Stephen Curry a run in their 3-pointer competition at the All-Star Game, set a WNBA mark with 128 treys last season.\n\n7. Brittney Griner -- Griner is looking for her third gold medal and she stood out in Tokyo with averages of 16.5 points and 7.2 rebounds. She has made 69 percent of her field-goal attempts in 14 Olympic contests.\n\n8. Kelsey Plum -- A first-time Olympian who is one of the WNBA's best all-around players. She has a career 88-percent free-throw percentage and has 64 treys in just 20 games this season.\n\n9. Diana Taurasi -- Her first Olympics was in 2004 in Athens, and her five gold medals are tied with former U.S. teammate Sue Bird for the most ever by an Olympic basketball player, man or woman. The 42-year-old averaged just 5.8 points in 2021 and figures to be a secondary contributor again this time.\n\n10. Napheesa Collier -- Collier is out indefinitely with plantar fasciitis in her left foot, sustained in a game on July 4, and she could end up being replaced on the roster. The Team USA coach is Cheryl Reeve, who also is Collier's coach with the Minnesota Lynx. Collier has received MVP chatter during her tremendous season, which includes averages of 20 points and 10.2 rebounds.\n\n11. Jackie Young -- One of four members of the two-time defending WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces on this team. Young is averaging career highs of 18.7 points, 5.7 assists, and 4.8 rebounds this season.\n\n12. Chelsea Gray -- Gray recently returned from a foot injury sustained in Game 3 of last season's WNBA Finals. The five-time All-Star would be higher on this list if not for the setback. She averaged 7.3 points and shot 58.1 percent from the field in the 2021 Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And the Chicago Sky's Angel Reese, the No. 7 overall pick, set a record for consecutive double-doubles. Clark and Reese were named to the 2024 All-Star team, earning their first selection in their first year in the league.\n\nClark and Reese top USA TODAY Sports' WNBA rookie power rankings:\n\nStats through 22 games: 16.1 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 7.4 app, 39.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: Caitlin Clark is used to breaking records at the collegiate level, and now she's doing it in the pros. She recorded 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in the Fever's 83-78 win over the New York Liberty on Saturday to mark the WNBA's first rookie triple-double. In addition to becoming the first Fever player in franchise history to score a triple-double, Clark also became the fastest player in the league to record 350 points and 150 assists. She leads all rookies in scoring and assists.\n\nStats through 20 games: 14.1 ppg, 11.9 rpg, 1.5 spg, 41.8% FG\n\nBreakdown: The 6-foot-3 forward scored 17 points and 14 rebounds in the Sky's 84-71 loss against the Seattle Storm on Sunday to mark her 13th consecutive double-double, passing Candace Parker (12) for the most in WNBA history. Do we need to say more? Reese has recorded a double-double in 14 of her first 20 games and leads the league in offensive rebounds (97) and total rebounds (237).\n\n\"I just go out there and do my job. My job is to rebound, so I'm going to go out there and do my job and rebound. I know that's what my teammates need me to do, and I've committed to that,\" Reese said after dropping a career-high 27 points in the Sky's 88-84 win over the Storm on July 5.\n\nStats through 21 games: 10.9 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 1.5 apg, 45.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: The Sparks may have dropped nine of their past 10 games, but Rickea Jackson has been a bright spot in Los Angeles. She dropped a career-high 22 points in the Sparks' 84-78 loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday and has reached double figures in 12 of her first 21 games. She is third in rookie scoring per game, trailing only Clark (16.1) and Reese (14.1).\n\nStats through 14 games: 8.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 1.1 bpg, 44.3% FG\n\nBreakdown: Kamilla Cardoso may have missed the first six games of the season with a shoulder injury, but the two-time NCAA champion is returning to form. She only scored six points in the Sky's 84-71 loss against the Seattle Storm on Sunday, but she was a force on the defensive side of the ball, recording a career-high four blocks, eight rebounds (all in the first quarter) and one steal. Cardoso is second in rookie blocks per game (1.1), trailing Cameron Brink (2.3), and second among rookies in rebounds per game (7.8).\n\nStats through 19 games: 8.6 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.1 apg, 48.4% FG\n\nBreakdown: Aaliyah Edwards had 10 points in the Mystics' 74-67 loss to the Minnesota Lynx on Saturday and she's the fourth leading rookie scorer per game (8.6), behind Clark, Reese and Jackson. Edwards is third in the league among rookies in total rebounds per game (6.0) and blocks per game (0.9). Edwards was also named to Canada's women's basketball team for the 2024 Paris Olympics, marking her second Olympic appearance. Despite Edwards' steady improvement, she was ranked No. 5 due to the fact that the Mystics are tied with the Dallas Wings for the worst record in the league at 5-17.\n\nNot ranked: Los Angeles Sparks' Cameron Brink is out of contention for Rookie of the Year after she suffered a torn ACL in the Sparks' 79-70 loss to the Connecticut Sun on June 18, effectively ending her season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_women's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah_Edwards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaliyah Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wKnbhM5YmwHnbWVM435XXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/3397c24d6c45f94cb20bb3ddd952bf99", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1977, "textEnd": 1983}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3829, "textEnd": 3836}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Getting three days off in between games, the Fever got some much needed rest ahead of this Eastern Conference battle.\n\nIndiana enters this game with a record of 9-13 on the season, which has them just percentage points above the Chicago Sky for the 7th seed in the WNBA standings. While the Mystics are last in the Eastern Conference, they trail Indiana by just four games, making this an important contest.\n\nAhead of this game against Washington, it was announced that Fever center Temi Fagbenle (right thumb injury) was not a participant in Tuesday's practice, making it unlikely she plays on Wednesday.\n\nFagbenle has missed as many games than she has played this season, having appeared in just 11 of Indiana's 22 games. This is unfortunate, because Fagbenle has been very productive when on the court, averaging career-highs across the board.\n\nEspecially effective alongside Fever star Caitlin Clark, Fagbenle has often been the recipient of impressive assists from her rookie teammate:\n\nIndiana has done well to stay afloat in Fagbenle's absence, as both Aliyah Boston and NaLyssa Smith have held down the front court. That said, the Fever certainly want Fabenle to be a consistent part of their rotation, especially as they try to maintain their hold on one of the final WNBA playoff spots.\n\nFor now, it seems Fagbenle will be out for Wednesday's game against Washington.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark's Two-Word Message to Kate Martin is Turning Heads\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark vs. Angel Reese WNBA Rookie of the Year Race Receives Big Development\n\nRelated: NBA Star Russell Westbrook and Wife Seen at WNBA Game Amid Trade Rumors", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temi_Fagbenle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temi Fagbenle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/74/57422afd-6ad4-53c3-b308-cb6dfc13b464/668da36f4eb45.image.jpg?crop=1133%2C595%2C0%2C102&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Sophie's physicality and years in the league put her in a unique position to discuss the perception that Caitlin Clark is being unfairly targeted by WNBA veterans due to the incredibly bright spotlight shone on her everywhere she goes.\n\nSpeaking with SLAM, Sophie said \"I think that there are a lot of new eyes, but with that, there's a lot of people who are uneducated about our League.\" She's not wrong about that. The WNBA is seeing unprecedented attendance and viewership thanks to Angel Reese, Caitlin Clark, and other emerging stars.\n\nBut she singled out Caitlin Clark specifically, saying \"You see a lot of people in the public eye on the men's side kind of having Caitlin Clark's back, too, which is kind of surprising just because they know how physical our game has always been. But when I tell you that the narrative that we're all against Caitlin or the vets against the rookies that needs to be squashed because it's not like that. I promise you, it's not like that.\n\nCunningham continued, saying \"I've had my jaw broken, I've broken a finger, I've broken my nose. Everyone has stories of how physical this League really is and I think that is the main jump that people don't understand.\"\n\nAs for Caitlin Clark's future, Sophie Cunningham made it clear that she believes the talent and skill is there and Caitlin is on her way to being amongst the league's best. She said \"It's like, her skill level will come, everything else will come; the rookies in general. But it's the physicality that people really have to get used to. And so for me, I don't think anyone's being targeted.\"\n\nCunningham went on to add that Caitlin Clark just needs some time to adjust, saying \"If anything, I think we need to give her a little bit of grace sometimes because she has a lot on her plate and a lot of eyes on her. But with that, I think this is gonna be really good for her. She's gonna be great. I think the rookie class is gonna be phenomenal for our League once they get that physicality thing kind of worked out. It takes a little bit of time [but] they're gonna be just fine.\"\n\nShe's a veteran. She knows what she is talking about more than people like myself outside of the league. But I think what's being lost in context here is that Caitlin Clark isn't necessarily getting the rookie treatment, she's getting the star treatment, and the league is allowing her to be unfairly fouled at times.\n\nThere's no denying that either, everyone has seen the footage. But as the rest of the league becomes more comfortable with more fans in attendance, flying in private jets, etc. the treatment of Caitlin Clark should simmer down.\n\nTo read the full interview on SLAM Magazine, follow the link up at the top of this article!", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cass_anderson@brobible.com", "name": "Cass Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slam (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_\u00c1ngel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/caitlin-clark-sophie-cunningham.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716834", "eventUri": "eng-9716834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

But the win against the current best team in the WNBA has certainly been the higlight.\n\n\"To come out against New York, have a tough offensive quarter in the second and the third quarter but still keep playing hard defensively, that's just where we grew,\" head coach Christie Sides said.\n\n\"There's a lot things we still could've done better in that game,\" Clark said. \"Our defense was pretty good though. On offense, I thought we pushed the ball well. So just continuing to build.\"\n\nClark's triple-double has helped that growth.

But for a while there, they were flying fast and furious and oftentimes had to include Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese as a Magic Johnson-Larry Bird type rivalry was being soft-launched. Along the way Clark earned the label of being controversial or polarizing even as she did everything she could to not take the bait or add much fuel to the fire.\n\nSo where do we stand 24 games into her rookie season, as she's risen to be one of the biggest storylines in all of sports? A new study from National Research Group canvassing over 1,000 self-described sports fans suggest that Clark is not, in fact, polarizing at all. Her numbers, crunched and translated by the Sports Business Journal, suggest she's bordering on being universally liked. And that the media's coverage of Clark has made her an even more sympathetic figure.\n\nThis is merely one study. And there will be so many more to come in Clark's career. Yet it does feel a bit instructive that Clark is enjoying overwhelmingly positive attention. Because there are a significant amount of people operating in bad faith trying to convince the public that she's reviled or the mainstream media is either too hard too soft on her.\n\nAll that's happening, through all the noise, is a very popular player growing more popular with more exposure.

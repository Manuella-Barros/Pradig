But it was the games that proved to be the real highlight of the day.The video, which has amassed over one million views online, sees family and friends taking part in a relay race complete with strollers, ramps, and alligator-infested waters before colliding into the finish line of water cooler dispensers that was \"such a hit.\"Entrusting her husband with the task, Martinec told Newsweek their friends and family \"loved every second of it.\"\"Both my husband and I were so happily surprised with how everyone reacted to our baby shower game,\" said Martinec, who is eight months pregnant.\"Seeing the reactions online felt like it took it to another level. We've been so happy reading a lot of the comments [that said] that they will be keeping our game in mind when they plan their future baby showers.\"Attendees of the baby shower can be seen getting very involved in the friendly competition. One TikTok user pointed out the first person seen in the video \"Man nearly ate LVP floor coming off the gator crossing!\"Comments asking the couple for the rules of the game and praising them for their efforts flooded in. One said \"the crocodiles in the pond are such a good touch\" while another wrote: \"This is fantastic!

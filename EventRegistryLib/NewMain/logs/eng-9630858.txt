The benefit of this rise in the last 2 months has been received by Indian investors. The day the exit poll came, foreigners bought at high prices and Indian investors sold at high prices and took profit. Foreigners bought Rs 6,850 crores in retail at high prices and Indian investors took advantage of it,\" he said.\n\n\"The next day, when the results came on the June 4, when the market fell, foreign investors sold at a low price and Indian investors bought it with the belief that Modi government is coming and we will take advantage of it. So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss. Rahul Gandhi talks about Rs 30 lakh crores. I understood why the people country have no faith in Rahul Gandhi because he does not even understand that it is valuation. Valuation does not mean anything. The purchase and sale is what matters. And foreigners incurred losses in that. Indian investors have benefited. So retail investors of India also benefited during this period,\" he added.\n\nRahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah had given \"investment advice\" to people during the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls which resulted in losses of lakhs of crores to retail investors and demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe terming it \"biggest stock market scam.\"\n\nThe Congress leader, who addressed a press conference, said that after \"fake\" exit polls, stock markets rose, and then crashed on June 4.\n\n\"The retail investors lost Rs 30 lakh crore, this is the biggest stock market scam,\" the Congress leader alleged.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government is set to form its third successive government after the results of Lok Sabha polls declared on June 4.

They understand that the ten years of the Modi government have taken the country to newer heights and have the confidence that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's able leadership...the big vision with which he has taken the country to today's position of being the world's fastest-growing large economy, they are confident that under his leadership, this country will continue to do better and better and become the world's third-largest economy while continuing the growth that we are witnessing in the last few years,\" Goyal said.\n\nPiyush Goyal rejected Rahul Gandhi's allegations relating to \"loss suffered\" by retail investors by stock market movement close to the results of Lok Sabha polls and said the trading value fell when Congress was seen gaining in seats. \"In April and May, when the market was rising, foreigners sold in the market and Indian investors took advantage of it and bought it. The benefit of this rise in the last 2 months has been received by Indian investors. The day the exit poll came, foreigners bought at high prices and Indian investors sold at high prices and took profit. Foreigners bought Rs 6,850 crores in retail at high prices and Indian investors took advantage of it,\" he said.\n\n\"The next day, when the results came on the June 4, when the market fell, foreign investors sold at a low price and Indian investors bought it with the belief that Modi government is coming and we will take advantage of it. So foreigners bought at a high price and sold at a low price. Indian investors sold at a high price and bought at a low price. So in a way, Indian investors earned even in this period. No one suffered a loss. Rahul Gandhi talks about Rs 30 lakh crores. I understood why the people country have no faith in Rahul Gandhi because he does not even understand that it is valuation. Valuation does not mean anything. The purchase and sale is what matters. And foreigners incurred losses in that. Indian investors have benefited. So retail investors of India also benefited during this period,\" he added. Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah had given \"investment advice\" to people during the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls which resulted in losses of lakhs of crores to retail investors and demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe terming it \"biggest stock market scam.\"\n\nThe Congress leader, who addressed a press conference, said that after \"fake\" exit polls, stock markets rose, and then crashed on June 4. \"The retail investors lost Rs 30 lakh crore, this is the biggest stock market scam,\" the Congress leader alleged.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government is set to form its third successive government after the results of Lok Sabha polls declared on June 4.

Now, people are confident that the Modi government is coming back, and the market has stabilised and is reclaiming its previous highs,\" he said.\n\nThe trading value was around Rs 6,840 crore, Mr Goyal said and added that when the Congress was seen gaining in seats on the day of the Lok Sabha poll result on June 4, then it fell.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that the reforms envisioned by the government will continue at a time when the country is poised for a bright future. \"We are delighted that our allies are progressive and support reforms,\" Mr Goyal said.\n\nThey know what is good for the people of India and that the Modi government has taken the country to new heights, he added.\n\nRahul Gandhi said stock markets surged after \"fake\" exit polls and then crashed the day votes for the Lok Sabha polls were counted on June 4.\n\n\"The common people of India lost Rs 30 lakh crore in the stock market on June 4...We demand a JPC investigation into this biggest-ever stock market scam,\" Mr Gandhi said.\n\nRebutting the allegations, Mr Goyal said Mr Gandhi was desperate after the opposition alliance failed in its bid for power and Modi is set to start his third term.\n\nHe is now hatching a conspiracy to scare domestic and foreign investors from putting their money in India when the prime minister is working to make the country the third largest global economy, Mr Goyal said.\n\nWhen the exit polls were broadcast, it was foreign investors who bought expensive stocks while domestic investors sold. When the market crashed, it was the other way round, he claimed to assert that domestic investors made money.\n\nIt is in the nature of markets to go up and down due to various factors and one has to take a long-term view to see how it has performed, Mr Goyal said, noting that its valuation has crossed USD 5 trillion for the first time.\n\nThe market cap has now risen to Rs 415 lakh crore from Rs 67 lakh crore when the Congress-led UPA government demitted office in 2014, he said, adding that the valuation of listed public sector firms has gone up by four times.\n\nThe share of domestic investors in the market has gone up to 84 per cent from 79 per cent in 10 years and this shows that they are the ones who have benefitted the most under the BJP-led NDA government, he said.\n\nThe size of the mutual fund industry has surged to Rs 56 lakh crore from Rs 10 lakh crore in this period, Mr Goyal added. The Modi government is coming back and investors have trust in India's growth story, he said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nQuestioned about the comments of Prime

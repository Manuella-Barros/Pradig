Shortly after the attack, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that two senior Hamas officials had been killed after targeting a Hamas compound. The Israeli attack followed Hamas' first rocket attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv in months.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the country's strike on a displacement camp in Rafah a \"tragic mistake.\" He said that Israel is carrying out investigation into the incident. The Israeli airstrikes in Rafah come days after the United Nations' top court ordered Israel to halt its operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and withdraw from the enclave, CNN reported.\n\nHowever, the Israeli government has been generally opposed to Palestinian statehood, meaning the new recognition will likely result in little change on the ground, as negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have halted during the conflict, according to The Hill. The Palestinian Authority controls the West Bank, though it was pushed out of Gaza in 2006 after the region was taken over by Hamas.\n\nThe US has reportedly urged the Israeli government to allow the Palestinian Authority into Gaza as its military clears the region, though Netanyahu has strongly denounced the concept.

At least 45 people were killed and 200 others were injured after the Israeli strike hit a camp for displaced people on May 26, CNN reported, according to the government media office in Gaza. Shortly after the attack, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that two senior Hamas officials had been killed after targeting a Hamas compound. The Israeli attack followed Hamas' first rocket attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv in months.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the country's strike on a displacement camp in Rafah a \"tragic mistake.\" He said that Israel is carrying out investigation into the incident. The Israeli airstrikes in Rafah come days after the United Nations' top court ordered Israel to halt its operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and withdraw from the enclave, CNN reported. However, the Israeli government has been generally opposed to Palestinian statehood, meaning the new recognition will likely result in little change on the ground, as negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have halted during the conflict, according to The Hill.

The Israeli attack followed Hamas' first rocket attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv in months.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the country's strike on a displacement camp in Rafah a \"tragic mistake.\" He said that Israel is carrying out investigation into the incident.\n\nThe Israeli airstrikes in Rafah come days after the United Nations' top court ordered Israel to halt its operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and withdraw from the enclave, CNN reported.\n\nHowever, the Israeli government has been generally opposed to Palestinian statehood, meaning the new recognition will likely result in little change on the ground, as negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have halted during the conflict, according to The Hill.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority controls the West Bank, though it was pushed out of Gaza in 2006 after the region was taken over by Hamas.\n\nThe US has reportedly urged the Israeli government to allow the Palestinian Authority into Gaza as its military clears the region, though Netanyahu has strongly denounced the concept.

Videos from the Tal al-Sultan area on Sunday night showed a large explosion and intense fires burning. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reported that they had killed two \"senior terrorists\" and were investigating the circumstances of the civilian deaths. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the incident as a \"tragedy,\" occurring hours after rockets were fired from Rafah towards Tel Aviv, marking the first long-range attacks on the central Israeli city since January.\n\nAddressing the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu called Sunday's strike a \"tragic mishap\" but pledged to continue operations in Rafah. The attack has sparked protests from regional governments, including Egypt and Qatar, who have acted as mediators in the conflict, as well as Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.\n\nEgypt condemned the strike as part of a \"systematic policy\" to make Gaza \"uninhabitable,\" while Qatar called it a \"dangerous violation of international law\" that could \"complicate ongoing mediation efforts.\" Jordan accused Israel of \"ongoing war crimes,\" and Saudi Arabia denounced the \"continued massacres.\"\n\nThe UN reports that around a million people have now fled the fighting in Rafah, with several hundred thousand more potentially still sheltering there. Residents have reported heavy bombardment of western districts early this week, the IDF stated it was continuing operations against \"terror targets.\"", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com",

Norway, Spain, and Ireland have recently recognized Palestine. Following these European nations' recognition of Palestine, India reiterated its long-standing stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Thursday. Spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs Randhir Jaiswal discussed India's longstanding support for the two-state solution and Palestinian statehood.\n\nWhen questioned about the coordinated recognition of Palestine by Spain, Ireland, and Norway, Jaiswal stated at a weekly press briefing, \"As you are aware, India was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in the late 1980s, and we have long supported a two-state solution which entails the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace.\"\n\nAmidst the Rafah attack, Israel has issued a warning that the Gaza war would last until the end of 2024. The European countries think that by recognizing Palestine, international efforts to bring about peace will pick up steam. \"We had wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\" stated Irish Prime MinisterSimon Harris in a statement. But in order to preserve the miracle of peace, we have taken this action with Spain and Norway,\" calling on Israel to \"end the humanitarian calamity\" in Gaza.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Sanchez insisted the move was \"not against anyone, least of all Israel\" and stressed that it was the only way to secure a future of two states living side-by-side \"in peace and security.\" Israel has repeatedly condemned the decision, asserting it bolsters Hamas, the militant Islamist group responsible for the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday, \"Sanchez, when you... recognize a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes.\"\n\nIndia also expressed deep concern over the recent loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah. Jaiswal remarked, \"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern. We have consistently called for the protection of the civilian population and respect for international humanitarian law in the ongoing conflict,\" noting that Israel has accepted responsibility and announced an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe Israeli strikes on Rafah have sparked widespread condemnation. Local health officials reported that the strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians, including many displaced individuals living in tents that were set ablaze on Sunday. The incident has led to a widespread outrage and solidarity on social media.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/30/1410717-news-2024-05-30t204906.695.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611274", "eventUri": "eng-9611274", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1771}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

This statement came from Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs, during a weekly press briefing. Jaiswal emphasized India's historical support for Palestine, noting that India was one of the first countries to recognize the state of Palestine in the late 1980s. He reiterated that India backs the creation of a sovereign, viable, and independent Palestinian state that would coexist peacefully with Israel.\n\nThis reaffirmation follows the decisions by Spain, Ireland, and Norway to formally recognize Palestine. These European nations hope their recognition will invigorate international efforts towards achieving peace. Ireland's Prime Minister Simon Harris expressed that this recognition aims to keep the hope for peace alive, despite initially wanting to recognize Palestine at the end of a peace process. He also called on Israel to halt the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nOn the Rafah situation, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal says, \"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern. We have consistently called for the protection of the civilian population and respect for international humanitarian law in the ongoing conflict. We also note that the Israeli side has already accepted responsibility for it as a tragic accident and announced an investigation into the incident..\"\n\nNorway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide described the recognition as a significant milestone for Norway-Palestine relations. Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez asserted that recognizing Palestine is crucial for peace and emphasized that the decision is not against Israel but rather a step towards ensuring two states can live in peace and security.\n\nIn response, Israel has criticized these recognitions, arguing that they support Hamas, the Islamist militant group responsible for the deadly attack on Israel on October 7, which triggered the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of being complicit in incitement to genocide against Jews by recognizing Palestine.\n\nIndia also voiced its concern over the tragic loss of civilian lives in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes killed at least 45 Palestinians, including many displaced individuals. The strikes on the displacement camp have drawn widespread condemnation and led to global outrage, with the hashtag \"All eyes on Rafah\" trending on social media.\n\nJaiswal highlighted India's consistent call for the protection of civilians and adherence to international humanitarian law. He noted that Israel has accepted responsibility for the incident and announced an investigation.

In a weekly press briefing, Randhir Jaiswal, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson said, \"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern. We have consistently called for the protection of the civilian population and respect for international humanitarian law in the ongoing conflict. We also note that the Israeli side has already accepted responsibility for it as a tragic accident and announced an investigation into the incident.\"\n\nAt least 45 people, including women and children, were killed in an Israeli air strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday. Videos from the Tal al-Sultan area on Sunday night showed a large explosion and intense fires burning. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reported that they had killed two \"senior terrorists\" and were investigating the circumstances of the civilian deaths. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the incident as a \"tragedy,\" occurring hours after rockets were fired from Rafah towards Tel Aviv, marking the first long-range attacks on the central Israeli city since January.\n\nAddressing the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu called Sunday's strike a \"tragic mishap\" but pledged to continue operations in Rafah. The attack has sparked protests from regional governments, including Egypt and Qatar, who have acted as mediators in the conflict, as well as Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.\n\nEgypt condemned the strike as part of a \"systematic policy\" to make Gaza \"uninhabitable,\" while Qatar called it a \"dangerous violation of international law\" that could \"complicate ongoing mediation efforts.\" Jordan accused Israel of \"ongoing war crimes,\" and Saudi Arabia denounced the \"continued massacres.\"\n\nThe UN reports that around a million people have now fled the fighting in Rafah, with several hundred thousand more potentially still sheltering there. Residents have reported heavy bombardment of western districts early this week, the IDF stated it was continuing operations against \"terror targets.\"\n\n'India recognised State of Palestine in 1980s'\n\nWhen asked about India's position on the recent recognition of Palestine by Ireland, Norway, and Spain, official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, \"As you are aware, India was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in the late 1980s, and we have long supported the two-state solution which entails the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace.\"\n\nLast week, Ireland, Norway, and Spain announced their recognition of the Palestinian state, with Spain announcing on May 28. Currently, over 143 United Nations member states recognize Palestinian statehood, though key countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom do not. In response to these recognitions, Israel's foreign ministry condemned the decisions, warning that they could \"fuel extremism and instability,\" and has recalled its envoys to Norway, Spain, and Ireland.\n\nPalestine has held non-member observer state status at the UN General Assembly since 2012. In November, Norway's parliament, the Storting, passed a resolution urging the government to recognize Palestine as a state. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide emphasized the importance of addressing the Gaza conflict through \"an irreversible path towards a settlement,\" noting that state recognition is a strategic tool, not an end goal. He clarified that Norway aims for a Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn response, Israel criticized the recognition as a \"distorted step.\" The Israeli foreign ministry reiterated its stance, warning that such moves could \"fuel extremism and instability,\" and confirmed the recall of its envoys from Norway, Spain, and Ireland.", "source": {"uri":

In a weekly media briefing here, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal said, \"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern. We have consistently called for protection of civilian population and respect for international humanitarian law in the ongoing conflict\".\n\nThe MEA noted that the Israeli side has already accepted responsibility for it as a tragic accident and announced an investigation into the incident. There has been a global condemnation after Israel's attack has killed several civilians in the city of Rafah in Southern Gaza.\n\nOn May 26, the airstrike happened at a camp for displaced people in Rafah. This came after Hamas launched rockets in the Tel Aviv area. In a statement, the Israeli military has said that the attack was based on precise intelligence against legitimate targets under international law. They added that it killed two senior Hamas officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the MEA said India was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in the late 1980s. This comes a day after Ireland, Spain and Norway formally recognised Palestine, despite Israel's violent response following seven months of operations in Gaza.\n\nWhen asked India's position regarding the recognition of Palestine by Ireland, Norway and Spain, the MEA spokesperson said, \"As you are aware, India was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in the late 1980s, and we have long supported two state solution which entails the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace\".\n\nRecognition of Palestine remains a complex and sensitive issue in international relations, with various countries taking different approaches based on their foreign policy priorities and the current geopolitical tension. India has traditionally supported the Palestinian cause and has always maintained its stance on the two-state solution, advocating for the peaceful coexistence of Israel and Palestine.\n\nIndia was one of the first non-Arab countries to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1974 and subsequently recognised the State of Palestine in 1988. New Delhi established full diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine in 1988. India has maintained its support for Palestinian statehood based on the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nIndia has consistently supported Palestine in various United Nations resolutions and other international forums. It has called for a just and comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nMoreover, New Delhi has provided developmental assistance to Palestine, including projects in education, health, and infrastructure. This assistance is part of India's broader commitment to supporting the socio-economic development of Palestine.\n\nWhile supporting Palestine, India has also developed strong bilateral relations with Israel, particularly in defense, agriculture, and technology. India's position is to support peaceful resolution and dialogue between Israel and Palestine.\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"},

India views these actions positively, as they align with its own stance on the issue. India's commitment to the Palestinian cause is rooted in its broader vision for peace and stability in the Middle East.(image/Reuters )\n\nIndia has consistently supported the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state. In the late 1980s, India was among the first countries to officially recognize Palestine. This long-standing position aligns with India's advocacy for a two-state solution.\n\nResponding to media queries at the Ministry of External Affairs weekly briefing, official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that India believes in the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognized and mutually agreed borders, coexisting peacefully alongside Israel.\n\nThis is what official spokesperson said regarding India's position regarding the recognition of Palestine by Ireland, Norway and Spain:\n\n\"As you are aware, India was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine in the late 1980s, and we have long supported two state solution which entails the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace.\"\n\nRecently, countries like Ireland, Norway, and Spain have also recognized Palestine. India views these actions positively, as they align with its own stance on the issue. India's commitment to the Palestinian cause is rooted in its broader vision for peace and stability in the Middle East. The recognition of Palestine by these European countries is seen as a step towards reinforcing the international consensus on the need for a two-state solution.\n\nIndia's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict has always been one of balance and neutrality. While maintaining strong diplomatic and economic ties with Israel, India has never wavered in its support for Palestinian rights and statehood. This balanced approach is reflective of India's broader foreign policy, which emphasizes dialogue, mutual respect, and peaceful coexistence.\n\nIndia's position on the recent events in Rafah\n\nTurning to recent events in Rafah, India expressed its deep concern about the tragic loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp. The ongoing conflict has led to significant humanitarian distress, and India has consistently called for the protection of civilian populations and adherence to international humanitarian law. The incident in Rafah, where many civilians lost their lives, highlights the urgent need for all parties to exercise restraint and ensure the safety of non-combatants, the official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n\nIndia notes that Israel has accepted responsibility for the incident in Rafah, acknowledging it as a tragic accident and has announced an investigation into the matter. This acknowledgment and the subsequent investigation are crucial steps towards accountability and preventing such incidents in the future.\n\nOn Rafah, this is what the official Spokesperson said:\n\n\"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern. We have consistently called for protection of the civilian population and respect for international humanitarian law in the ongoing conflict. We also note that the Israeli side has already accepted responsibility for it as a tragic accident and announced an investigation into the incident.\"\n\nThe tragic events in Rafah serve as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the necessity for renewed efforts towards achieving lasting peace in the region.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "huma_siddiqui@financialexpress.com", "name": "Huma Siddiqui", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rafah-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611274", "eventUri": "eng-9611274", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

This began after Palestinian militant group Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on October 7 that killed 1,200 people. The militant group had also taken over 200 people hostage.\n\nA hundred of those hostages are still believed to be alive and in Gaza, according to Al Jazeera. Some of the hostages were released in November as part of a brief ceasefire agreement and others were killed as a result of the war.\n\nSince October, Israel has been carrying out unprecedented air and ground strikes on Gaza. The attacks have killed at least 36,700 persons, including over 15,000 children.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/201078-ggmkmubygr-1717140445.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611274", "eventUri": "eng-9611274", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 344}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1766, "textEnd": 1775}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The Indian stand on the carnage was shared by the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, during the weekly press briefing.\n\nHe also highlighted that India had recognised the Palestinian state way back in the late 1980s.\n\n\"The heartbreaking loss of civilian lives in the displacement camp in Rafah is a matter of deep concern.

This incident coincided with Spain, Ireland and Norway granting recognition to the Palestinian state. In response to a question, Mr. Jaiswal reiterated India's support for a \"two-state solution\" to the Israel-Palestinian crisis.\n\n\"We have long supported a two-state solution, which entails the establishment of a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine within recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace,\" said Mr. Jaiswal when asked about the move by Ireland, Norway and Spain.\n\n'All eyes on Rafah' image shared 44 mn times on social media'Objective view' in Pakistan\n\nThe official spokesperson also took note of the remarks by former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that Islamabad had violated the 1999 Lahore pact signed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr. Sharif on February 21, 1999, However, months later, the Kargil war broke out.\n\n\"You are aware of our position on the issue. I need not have to reiterate that. We note that there is an objective view emerging in Pakistan as well on this matter,\" Mr. Jaiswal said to a question during the interaction.\n\nIsrael sends tanks into Rafah on raids, defying World Court order amid Gaza-wide offensive\n\nEarlier acknowledging that Pakistani missteps in 1999 that hurt the prospects of peace between India and Pakistan, Mr. Sharif said on Wednesday, \"On May 28, 1998, Pakistan carried out five nuclear tests. After that Vajpayee saheb came here and we made an agreement. But we violated that agreement....it was our fault,\" Mr. Sharif said, after he became the president of the PML-N for six years.\n\nAfter taking charge, the former PM, who also participated in the \"mini SAARC summit\" of May 2014 in Delhi, presented his version of the events that took place in Pakistan over the past three decades. He said the U.S. government under President Bill Clinton tried to stop Pakistan from going nuclear and offered $5 billion for ensuring that, but he had rejected the offer and went ahead with nuclear tests at Chagai range in Balochistan on May 28, 1998, after the Pokhran nuclear blasts by India on May 11, 1998.\n\nIndia-Pakistan ties have been frozen in animosity since 2016 after India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for attacking military installations in Pathankot and Uri, following which India carried out a \"surgical strike\" along the Line of Control.\n\nRead Comments", "source":

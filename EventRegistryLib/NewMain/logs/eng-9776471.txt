Manchester United, on the other hand, wanted \u20ac30m,\" Kucuk said.\n\n\"If Manchester United don't get the offers they want, McTominay could go to Galatasaray for \u20ac20m. Let me remind you, Galatasaray signed Mauro Icardi in September.\"\n\nIs McTominay worth \u00a325.3m?\n\nExit talk surrounding McTominay has been fuelled by the fact that the Scotsman only has one year left on his Red Devils contract, although the club can trigger a 12-month extension until 2026.\n\nActivating that option would immediately help to protect McTominay's value, but Man United have held back in previous instances, as they have usually triggered such clauses in January when players enter the last six months of their deals.\n\nWith 29 goals under his belt from 252 games in a Man United jersey, home-grown status and being a key player for his national team, \u00a325m is not an outrageous figure for McTominay, but the Red Devils should expect clubs to baulk at that price while his contract is due to expire in 2025.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

Those wins represent nine points and they would have produced a point (a draw against Villa) without his goals.\n\nALSO READ: Not everyone will be happy with ambitious Old Trafford plan\n\nALSO READ: I coached the rising United star who impressed Rooney\n\nCan you put a price on an extra eight points in the Premier League? United earned just 60 points last season and McTominay was directly responsible for earning 15 per cent of that total.\n\nUnited finished in eighth position, the club's worst-ever Premier League finish, but in a normal campaign, recording eight fewer points could be the difference between qualifying for the Champions League and not qualifying for European competition altogether.\n\nMcTominay was worth his wages and his reinvention as a goalscoring, attacking midfielder saw him become more effective than ever before. The academy graduate's qualities in a deeper role are no secret but he's a threat when making late runs into the opposition's box.\n\nIt's not a surprise that McTominay is the subject of interest from other clubs this summer and his value on the back of a wonderful campaign has never been so high.\n\nIt's understood United value McTominay at around \u00a340million and considering he's entered the final year of his contract, the will be a temptation to sell him in this window.\n\nHowever, there's an option to extend McTominay's contract by another year included in his deal and, importantly, Erik ten Hag wants to keep him for the new season.\n\n\"I think we have very good players so they'll always have an interest from other clubs,\" said Ten Hag about McTominay after the recent pre-season friendly against Rangers.\n\n\"If you score 10 goals in a season and perform very well for Scotland there will be an interest. We want to actually keep him because he's a very important player for our squad.\n\n\"We've seen what he can contribute last season. When we had the sixes and he could play in a more advanced role, he's a highly interesting player for our team.\"\n\nTen Hag has gone from being open to selling McTominay to reiterating he must be kept. The 27-year-old spared his manager's blushes by ensuring United didn't record an even lower finish in the league last season and it doesn't seem right to sell him this summer, so the one-year extension in his deal should be triggered.\n\nWhether he deserves another deal is debatable, but there's a feeling that Sir Alex Ferguson would always find a role in his dressing room for someone of McTominay's ilk.\n\nMcTominay is a positive influence in the dressing room, he cares about the club and regularly fronts up in interviews after games that haven't gone United's way.\n\nHe became a matchwinner last season and must be kept for 2024/25, at least.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_railston@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Steven Railston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29635745.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2163883891.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776471", "eventUri": "eng-9776471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

United ideally want \u00a340m for the Scotland international, with McTominay's experience and talent making him a solid choice for Fulham. Manchester United's summer transfer decisions could impact McTominay's possible move to Craven Cottage.\n\nFulham are reportedly looking to sign Scott McTominay from Manchester United this summer after losing Joao Palhinha to Bayern Munich, but GIVEMESPORT sources have suggested that they only want to pay a maximum of \u00a330 million to lure him away from Old Trafford.\n\nLosing a player of Palhinha's ilk and then replacing them is no easy task as the Cottagers are currently finding out. The tough-tackling Portuguese played a starring role in their quietly brilliant 2023/24 Premier League campaign, which caused the German club to fork out \u00a346.5m for him.\n\nRelated Exclusive: Fulham Move Has 'Some Appeal' to \u00a330m Star After Smith Rowe\n\nFulham will have to assure Scott McTominay that a move to Craven Cottage is the right option at this stage of his career\n\nMcTominay has emerged as a potential option and his top flight experience combined with his evident talent - showcased over the years in M16 - would make him a solid option for Marco Silva and his entourage, especially at the right price.\n\nFulham Deal for McTominay Could Cost \u00a330m Plus Scot viewed as better fit than Kalvin Phillips Close\n\nAs exclusively revealed by GIVEMESPORT earlier this month, even before Palhinha was sold, Carrington graduate McTominay is of concrete interest to the west London-based outfit, with a potential deal being explored. At that time, Manchester City outcast Kalvin Phillips was also considered as an option, but the Scotsman's style of play was believed to be better suited to Fulham, according to GMS sources.\n\nRecent reports have suggested that a transfer for the midfielder in question would need to be around the \u00a340 million mark thanks to how highly-rated he is at his current employers, but GMS sources believe a deal below that could be struck.\n\nPalhinha and McTominay - 23/24 Premier League Stats\n\nStatistic\n\nPalhinha\n\nMcTominay\n\nMinutes\n\n2,711\n\n1,893\n\nGoals/Assists\n\n4/1\n\n7/1\n\nPass success rate (%)\n\n83\n\n81.5\n\nTackles per game\n\n4.6\n\n1.5\n\nInterceptions per game\n\n1.4\n\n0.4\n\nOverall rating\n\n7.04\n\n6.71\n\nThat said, the \u00a330 million has been earmarked as the price on McTominay's head. Last summer, Manchester United rejected a proposal - around the same figure - from West Ham United, but the prospect of a rebuild under their new ownership could force them to sell.\n\nWhat could play into Fulham's hands is that McTominay is an academy product, thus making his sale pure profit. The 27-year-old, since emerging into first-team proceedings, has played over 250 times for the club but has struggled to dislodge the likes of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in recent campaigns.\n\nMcTominay Deal Could Depend on Man Utd Business Ten Hag eyeing Ugarte loan deal Close\n\nWhat McTominay's prospective switch to Craven Cottage could depend on is how Manchester United navigate through the summer transfer window from here on out.\n\nGMS sources have confirmed that Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag is keen to retain the services of the midfielder, though the Dutchman is under the assumption that sales across the coming weeks are inevitable in order to acquire new players themselves.\n\nMcTominay, one of the best current players that could've played for England but chose not to, has rarely been a first choice for the former Ajax boss since he arrived in Greater Manchester, meaning that he could be enticed into leaving his boyhood club before the summer transfer window slams shut.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: McTominay was Manchester United's joint-third top goalscorer in 2023/24, notching 10 strikes in all competitions.\n\nIncredibly, in a shock turn of events, there is every chance that Casemiro - who had been linked with a move away two summers after his arrival - could be in line for a Premier League start once the new season gets underway.\n\nGMS sources also understand that McTominay's employers, Manchester United, are still working on a deal for Paris Saint-Germain outcast Manuel Ugarte. Should they manage to snare a deal for the Uruguayan, with a loan currently looking like their best bet, it would increase the chances of the 52-cap Scotland international moving on.\n\nAll statistics per WhoScored", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Palhinha", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00e3o Palhinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Smith_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emile Smith Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fulham.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776471", "eventUri": "eng-9776471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Bayern Munich's Noussair Mazraoui is of interest to United.\n\nFulham, who are looking for a replacement for Palhinha, are now looking to land McTominay despite also holding talks with Fluminense over Andre.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_webbley@hitc.com", "name": "Shaun Webbley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Palhinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00e3o Palhinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluminense_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fluminense FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wan-Bissaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scotsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Scotsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163186866-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776471", "eventUri": "eng-9776471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

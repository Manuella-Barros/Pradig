TMZ has learned.\n\nHere's the deal ... a blind item is being circulated that purports to have the inside scoop on an alleged meeting between Kendrick, Drake and Universal Music Group ... which both artists are technically signed to via distribution subsidiaries.\n\nThere's a few bullet points addressed in the blind item -- including the claim that UMG honchos tried to force Kendrick to capitulate to Drake and apologize and squash things.\n\nThe blind item -- citing purported insiders -- said UMG wanted to have K.Dot put out a statement acknowledging that Drake is not, in fact, a pedophile ... this while alleging that UMG brass was viewing Drake as losing big time in the beef and it hurting their bottom line.\n\nIt also sounded pretty thorough and detailed ... but sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ there was no such meeting between UMG, Drake and Kendrick ... and that this entire little narrative -- which is starting to go viral online -- is completely made up and not true.\n\nWe're told not only did UMG not insert itself here ... but our sources, who are familiar with the inner workings of the label, say Universal would never jump into something like this.\n\nThe way it was explained to us ... Kendrick and Drake's beef is between them and completely separate from the business side of things -- and UMG just doesn't think it's their place to step in either way. So, they didn't ... nor did they ever consider doing so.\n\nMind you, there's also the fact that all these music drops have clearly only helped them. All the tracks between these two guys have spurred lots of streams and plays -- and that's dollars for UMG ... so, objectively, there's a financial incentive to keep a beef like this going.\n\nNow, in terms of whether it actually will keep going or die on the vine ... all signs point to the latter. DJ Hed telegraphed this earlier this week, suggesting Drake was throwing in the towel and moving on. Of course, that was before a shooting took place at Drake's house.\n\nNo telling how the unfortunate development may affect things in the music space -- on the issue of either of these titans being brought in by the principal to work out their problems ... we're told it's complete BS.\n\nHere's hoping they can work out their issues quietly (and non-violently) behind the scenes.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_item", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blind item"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brass instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/8b/16by9/2024/05/07/8b5caa2d38c54eaeb096e5583e9cee73_xl.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Universal Music Group reportedly is not interfering in the ongoing feud between the \"Hotline Bling\" hitmaker and the \"Like That\" spitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 7, TMZ confirmed that the speculation about the music label attempting to make Drake and Kendrick move on from their beef is not true. Speaking to the media outlet, a number of sources spilled, \"There was no such meeting between UMG, Drake and Kendrick,\" adding, \"This entire little narrative, which is starting to go viral online, is completely made up and not true.\"\n\nThe sources, who claimed to be \"familiar with the inner workings of the label,\" told the outlet that \"not only did [Universal Music Group] not insert itself here\" but also \"[the label] would never jump into something like this.\" The outlet noted, \"Kendrick and Drake's beef is between them and completely separate from the business side of things. And [Universal Music Group] just doesn't think it's their place to step in either way. So, they didn't, nor did they ever consider doing so.\"\n\nThe revelation came after a rumor about Universal Music Group mediating Drizzy and K.Dot circulated online. A screenshot featuring a message about a meeting between the two hip-hop artists and the label recently made its rounds online. The message read, \"pgLang (Kendrick) and XO (The Weeknd), as of yesterday, were asked by Universal Music Group (UMG) to end their beef with OVO (Drake).\"\n\n\"Kendrick apparently isn't budging at all, but UMG is pressing hard on their request to squash the beef,\" it continued. \"UMG also had a Zoom meeting with all of the parties involved, and they want Kendrick, either directly or said through pgLang, to post a statement clarifying that Drake isn't a pedophile if Kendrick agrees to end the beef.\"\n\n\"Drake is losing the beef in UMG's eyes, so from UMG's perspective: The sooner that their beef ends, the better,\" it added. \"The pedophile accusations directed at Drake are costing UMG, Nike and other parties 'a lot of money.' \"\n\nDrake and Kendrick have been exchanging diss tracks since Future and Metro Boomin released \"Like That\", featuring K.Dot's disses against Drizzy, on March 22. In response, Drake dropped \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle\". Kendrick clapped back with \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 In LA\" before his nemesis responded with \"Family Matters\".\n\nThe feud got worse when K.Dot fired back with \"Meet the Grahams\" and \"Not Like Us\", on which he labels Drizzy a \"certified pedophile.\" Not letting his rival win, Drizzy, whose security guard recently was shot outside his Toronto mansion, shuts down the accusation on \"The Heart Part 6\".", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Bling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotline Bling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGLang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XO_(record_label)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "XO (record label)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OVO Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/05/08/00224008.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 452, "textEnd": 457}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 2431, "textEnd": 2439}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Drake and Kendrick Lamar has not only had to contend with fake diss songs, but they've spread information about the other person without providing concrete evidence. The misinformation spree continued on May 7. Drake's record label, UMG, was accused of stepping in and putting an end to the battle because the rapper was \"losing.\" A document surfaced online with a list of steps UMG has taken to end things.\n\nThe document in question claimed that UMG asked The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar to end their battle with Drake. It detailed Zoom meetings with the artists' respective labels, and claims that UMG was losing money over Drake's pedophile allegations. \"Drake is losing the beef in UMG's eyes,\" the document read. \"So from UMG's perspective, the sooner than this beef ends the better.\" It didn't take long for real UMG reps to speak out and state that none of these actions have been taken.\n\nRead More: DJ Akademiks Relays Message From Drake After Shooting: \"He's Okay\"\n\nUMG, which is short for Universal Music Group, issued a denial to TMZ. The label has never considered getting involved in the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar battle. \"Kendrick and Drake's beef is between them and completely separate from the business side of things,\" TMZ reported. \"And UMG just doesn't think it's their place to step in either way.\" It's easy to see why UMG is staying clear. The label is reaping the benefiting from the battle with historic streaming numbers.\n\nDrake and Kendrick Lamar will draw over 250 million streams in the United States this week. This means that the handful of releases between will make up a staggering 20% of all streams on the Billboard Hot 100. Firstly, Drake, UMG's artist, managed to land a top 20 single with \"Push Ups.\" Secondly, the music video for his follow-up diss, \"Family Matters,\" trended number one on YouTube. It's since racked up an impressive 17 million views. If anything, UMG would benefit from the battle continuing to unfold. Drake may have had another diss prepped to drop on May 7, but a shooting outside of his home led to a delay.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danilo_castro@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Danilo Castro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Akademiks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DJ Akademiks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/05/GettyImages-1836065267.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 295, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Lamar released Not Like Us on May 4, and Drake followed up with The Heart Part 6 on May 5.\n\nIt was initially fun for many to see the renowned Canadian hip-hop artist Drake and Compton-based rapper Kendrick Lamar hash their issues out using their songs, also known as \"diss tracks,\" to shame the other.\n\nHowever, the renowned beef between the two is getting out of hand, with Drake going as far as to use generative AI to replicate the voice of the departed West Coast legend, Tupac Shakur.\n\nHowever, Drake did not vehemently deny it, as the earlier released diss, Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), was initially rumored to have been made with AI.\n\nThat being said, Drake's response was to release a deepfake featuring Metro Boomin, another artist the Canadian rapper has an issue with, superimposing him over Nick Cannon's body in a clip from a 2002 movie, Drumline.\n\nSince the AI-made issue, Drake took down the song Taylor Made, but the beef between both rappers did not end there. Massive issues were brought up, leading to many creating misinformation about fake tracks and information about these rappers.\n\nIt now went as far as to unknown individuals claiming that UMG intervened to stop the feud as it is hurting them due to Drake losing the battle, but that is not the case and is fake.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaiah_richard@techtimes.com", "name": "Isaiah Richard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_leak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music leak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGLang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XO_(record_label)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "XO (record label)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OVO Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/446965/820/0/0/0/kendrick-lamar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1944, "textEnd": 1949}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1998, "textEnd": 2003}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

But it wasn't always this way.\n\nOver a decade ago, the pair collaborated on a few songs: On Drake's 2011 track \"Buried Alive Interlude,\" on Lamar's 2012 release \"Poetic Justice,\" and on A$AP Rocky's \"(Expletive) ' Problems\" that same year.\n\nRELATED: Kendrick Lamar accuses Drake of being a 'certified pedophile' in 'Not Like Us' diss track\n\nThat didn't last very long. In 2013, Pulitzer Prize winner Lamar was featured on Big Sean's \"Control,\" in which he called out a slew of contemporary rappers including Drake, J. Cole, Meek Mill, Pusha T, A$AP Rocky, Big K.R.I.T., Wale, Pusha T and even Big Sean among them.\n\n\"I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you,\" he rapped. \"Trying to make sure your core fans never heard of you.\"\n\nDrake responded in a Billboard cover story, saying \"I know good and well that Kendrick's not murdering me, at all, in any platform.\" Shortly afterward, at the 2013 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Lamar took another jab at Drake.\n\nOver the next few years, the rappers launched disses at each other with less frequency. Drake had other beefs with other performers, like Meek Mill in 2015, and most infamously Pusha T in 2018, where the latter rapper dropped \"The Story of Adidon,\" revealing Drake is a father.\n\nIn October 2023, J. Cole perhaps accidentally reignited the beef on \"First Person Shooter\" with Drake. He rapped \"Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?\" referencing Lamar and Drake's birth name, Aubrey Graham. \"We the big three like we started a league / but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali.\"\n\nRELATED: 'Euphoria': Kendrick Lamar drops Drake diss track\n\nWhich brings us to the current moment. Here's a timeline of the developments in recent weeks -- it should be noted that diss tracks between rappers often include exaggerated truths and unsubstantiated rumors for dramatic effect, and that police have not said the feud led to Tuesday's shooting.\n\n\"The big three,\" Lamar raps, referencing J. Cole's boast. \"It's just big me.\"\n\nHe references Drake's 2023 album \"For All the Dogs,\" and also compares himself to Prince and Drake to Michael Jackson: \"Prince outlived Mike Jack.\"\n\nJ. Cole soon releases a response, \"7 Minute Drill,\" but quickly apologizes for it onstage at his Dreamville Festival in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nDrake's response is leaked and later premiered by DJ Akademiks. \"You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped down, Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down,\" he raps about Lamar.\n\nIt also assumed Drake takes aim at Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross and The Weeknd -- Ross releases a response track shortly afterward.\n\nDrake's second diss track used artificial intelligence technology to include verses from Tupac and Snoop Dogg, two of Lamar's influences. In his own verse, Drake accuses Lamar of delaying his response track because of the imminent release of Taylor Swift 's \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" (Lamar collaborated with Swift on \"Bad Blood.\")\n\nTupac's estate threatened to sue Drake in response, so he removed the song from his social channels.\n\nSnoop Dogg responded to the news in a video on Instagram. \"They did what? When? How? Are you sure?\" he said. \"I'm going back to bed. Good night.\"\n\nThis is where it gets more complicated. Lamar's \"Euphoria\" hits like an opus, unleashing a slew of allegations against Drake. He comes after Drake's skills as a rapper, use of AI, appearance, racial identity, and parenting.\n\n\"I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that,\" Lamar raps.\n\nThe title is a reference to the HBO series \"Euphoria,\" of which Drake is an executive producer.\n\nLamar teases that he'll go \"back-to-back\" with his tracks.\n\nIn Lamar's next diss, titled after a time and location like Drake is wont to do, Lamar targets the company Drizzy keeps. \"Have you ever thought that OVO was working for me? / Fake bully, I hate bullies,\" he raps, referencing Drake's record label. \"You must be a terrible person / Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"\n\n]According to Billboard, the song was produced by Sounwave and Jack Antonoff -- the latter notably Swift's longtime producer. It also samples Al Green's \"What a Wonderful Thing Love Is,\" on which one of Drake's relatives played guitar.\n\nDrake hits back with a music video and a nearly eight-minute response, in which he alleges abuse and infidelity in Lamar's relationship with his fiancee.\n\nAlmost immediately afterward, Lamar releases \"Meet the Grahams,\" which begins with the rapper addressing Drake's son: \"I'm sorry that man is your father.\" Lamar also addresses Drake's parents, and \"a baby girl,\" alleging that Drake has a secret daughter.\n\nHe also labels Drake a \"predator,\" without elaborating.\n\nHours later, Lamar doubles down, releasing \"Not Like Us,\" produced by DJ Mustard.\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\" Lamar raps.\n\nReferencing Lamar's \"The Heart\" series, Drake drops \"The Heart Part 6\" in response. In the song, which samples Aretha Franklin's \"Prove It,\" Drake challenges Lamar's allegations, doubles down on his own against him, and says that he does not have a secret daughter.\n\nHe sounds notably lethargic on the song -- potentially taking a final bow with verses like, \"You know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you / I'm happy I could motivate you.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Incidentally, the duo have also worked together in the past. Drake's 2011 album, Take Care, features Lamar on an interlude. Likewise, Lamar had Drake on his second studio album, 2012's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City - specifically the song Poetic Justice. However, things as of today, appear far from a point of collaboration, let alone reconciliation.\n\nThe first act\n\nIn 2013, Kendrick Lamar featured in Big Sean's track, Control. The track saw Lamar call out several rappers including Drake - Drake however, let this one slide. Fast forward to 2018, Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for his album DAMN, also publicly taking offence to the fact that many considered Drake to be on the same level as him - something he spelled out in Future's song Like That. Around this time, J Cole briefly entered the simmering feud, with track 7 Minute Drill from his surprise album Might Delete Later. Cole sided with Drake, dissing Lamar.\n\nDrake finally hit back at Lamar, with not one, but two diss tracks - Push Ups and Taylor Made Freestyle. Drake particularly looked down upon Lamar's collaborations on pop songs. He even challenged Lamar to push the feud further, with the line 'While we wait on you, I guess' in Taylor Made Freestyle. Lamar's next response, truly upped the stakes, for the sheer amount of direct references it made to Drake. Called Euphoria, the track's title itself was directed at Drake, considering his status as executive producer on the series of the same name.\n\nMore recent developments\n\nThe same week as Lamar releasing Euphoria, the rapper doubled down on Drake with yet another track, 6:16 in LA. 6:16 was understood as a reference to Bible verse, Corinthians 6:16. The way Lamar used it implied Drake's reportedly consistent involvement with prostitutes. Drake came right back with song Family Matters, which questioned the paternity of Lamar's child with fiance Whitney Alford. Less than an hour later, Lamar hit back with song Meet The Grahams, which started with the rapper apologising to Drake's son for having Drake as a father. The song also compared Drake to sex offender Harvey Weinstein.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Lamar came right back with a second track - four-and-a-half minutes long - implying Drake's alleged interest in underage girls. The latest development in this saga, has been Drake's The Heart Part 6 which primarily refuted Lamar's previously stated claims. Drake also declared how he intentionally shared fake information with Lamar to see if he fell for it. This verbal duel, for all practical purposes, appears to be a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_entertainment_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic Entertainment Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Justice_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poetic Justice (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sean", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Sean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprise_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surprise album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

J. Cole has real friends and they warned HIM. Which is why J. Cole stepped away from the simmering beef weeks ago and publicly apologized to Kendrick. Reportedly, ScHoolboy Q was the one to pull J. Cole aside and have a conversation about how Kendrick was fully prepared to take down Drake, and J.Cole didn't want to get caught in the crossfire. Now, maybe Drake was warned like that too and he disregarded the warning out of ego and stupidity. As Kendrick has indicated repeatedly, Drake's crew is compromised.\n\nWithin a week, Kendrick dropped \"Euphoria,\" \"6:16 in LA,\" \"Meet the Grahams\" and then \"Not Like Us.\" These songs have ruined Drake, and they've also showed that Kendrick can really do it all. \"Not Like Us\" is not only an evisceration of Drake personally and professionally (referring to him as both a pedophile AND a colonizer), it's turning out to be one of the most successful songs of Kendrick's career. \"Not Like Us\" is such a huge hit, it dethroned a Spotify streaming record set by Drake. It will likely debut at #1 on Spotify's global chart.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" is having a huge cultural impact too - the YouTube reactors are seeing their view numbers explode as they break down the beef and the music, and behind the scenes, Kendrick has removed the copyrights on his songs for the YouTubers, so they can make some money. \"Not Like Us\" is being played at MLB games and NBA games too - LA Dodger Gavin Lux used the song for his walkup. TNT used the song during the Timberwolves game on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some fascinating rumors swirling on social media. There's a rumor that Kendrick was going to release another diss track on Tuesday but he hit pause because there was a shooting at Drake's mansion in Toronto. Kendrick said in \"Not Like Us\" that he has a lot more to say and possibly up to five more songs just about Drake.\n\nThere's also a big rumor that the suits are now getting involved and trying to exert pressure on Kendrick to make peace, all because \"Certified Loverboy? Certified Pedophiles\" is hurting their bottom line. Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian amplified that rumor, but that being said, TMZ has an article disputing it. TMZ's sources said that UMG (Drake and Kendrick's shared label) did not insert itself in the beef and no one at Universal would step in like that: \"The way it was explained to us ... Kendrick and Drake's beef is between them and completely separate from the business side of things -- and UMG just doesn't think it's their place to step in either way. So, they didn't ... nor did they ever consider doing so.\" It sounds more like everyone knows that Kendrick can't be controlled, right?", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

This is important with all types of relationships, from the workplace to even your roommate and how you talk with friends. Drake and Lamar used to be friends, when Drake first came on the scene.\n\nThe first conflict appears to have emerged around 2013, when Lamar participated on Big Sean's \"Control.\" Lamar called out Drake and numerous rappers in the song, but the Toronto rapper didn't respond at first, saying in interviews at the time that he would not take the bait.\n\nFast forward to 2024, Drake didn't know how much Lamar disliked him until it was too late, and he was featured in a diss track with Future and Metro Boomin, \"Like That\" as a response to \"First Person Shooter\" by Drake and J.Cole. Later, Lamar made it even more clear in \"Euphoria.\" Perhaps this could've been a conversation had a long time ago...\n\n2. The Culture is Shifting\n\nThere is some good stemming from the feud between Drake and Lamar.\n\n\"I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie,\" Lamar raps in the diss track \"Euphoria.\" Ever since he uttered that famous lyric, the original New Ho King has seen a rise in their sales, as Lamar fans have stopped by to try the famous Kendrick Special. Earlier this week, a former educator went viral on TikTok as she talked about the Literacy crisis in America.\n\nTo combat this, teachers are now using the Lamar and Drake rap beef in class as part of the curriculum. From dissecting the lyrics with students or using the two rappers to teach how to create characters in a story and the difference between a protagonist and an antagonist, these real-world situations are used now to teach in public schools.\n\n3. The Best Work Can Be Created Under Pressure\n\nBoth rappers respectfully rose to the occasion for a short period of time and were able to partake in creating the biggest beef in rap history. Many experts in rap are comparing this to the late Biggie and Tupac rivalry. When Kendrick appeared on \"Like That,\" it had been almost two years since his album \"Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\" Yet his streaming numbers had surpassed, with the West Coast rapper hitting peak numbers while Drake's streaming numbers went down by five percent.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Lamar's recent tracks are performing well on their own: \"Euphoria\" is currently ranked #11 on the Hot 100. All of Lamar's other songs have also grown by 49% since the feud began.\n\nDrake and J. Cole both mentioned Lamar in \"First-person Shooter\" that they hadn't heard from the rapper, and it became a later consensus that he took longer to put out music. Yet when under pressure, his streams rose, he came out with a diss dance track that is now the most streamed and has made streaming history with Spotify's single-day streaming record for a hip-hop song with 6.59 million listens.", "source": {"uri": "cw33.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CW33 TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maiya_turner@cw33.com", "name": "Maiya Turner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDAF", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KDAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sean", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Sean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

While they were on the come-up together and being dubbed as the future of hip-hop in the early '10s, the duo seemed to be a united front. They teamed up for bangers like the 'Buried Alive' interlude on Drake's magnum opus 'Take Care' and the sultry Janet Jackson-sampling 'Poetic Justice' from Lamar's major label-debut 'good kid, m.A.A.d city'.\n\nHowever, after a decade of sending shots at one another, Drake and Lamar's friendship has turned sour, resulting in increasingly sinister rapid releases from both men, resulting in a rap battle that is captivating the world.\n\nFriends to foes\n\nIn 2011, both Drake and Kendrick Lamar were dubbed to the next rap superstars after the success of their respective debut albums, 'Thank Me Later' and 'Section80', and Drake invited Lamar and fellow budding star A$AP Rocky to open for him on the Club Paradise tour. With the tour going well (it was the highest-grossing US rap tour in 2012) and a leaked collaboration that turned out to be 'Buried Alive' emerged online, this union appeared to have legs - especially since Lamar told XXL that he and the Canadian \"clicked immediately\" when they met.\n\nDrake commented on the verse in an interview with Billboard shortly after the song's release. Drake said: \"It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was. I know good and well that Kendrick's not murdering me, at all, in any platform.\" Numerous rappers like Joey Badass, Joe Budden, Jay Electronica and more released their respective response tracks to 'Control' - but Drake didn't.\n\nSince then, \"sneak disses\" have been sent between both Drake and Lamar. The first is speculated to be done by the Canadian juggernaut on 'The Language' from his 2013 album 'Nothing Was The Same'. In the song, he called out an unknown rapper, telling them \"Your shit is not that inspirin'\". Lamar apparently clapped back in a BET Hip-Hop Cypher and ever since, the two had dropped subliminal messages for one another in their songs.\n\nThe diss tracks\n\nBack in March this year, Kendrick hopped on 'Like That' from Metro Boomin and Future's joint album 'We Don't Trust You'. On the menacing beat, Lamar clapped back at J. Cole and Drake's collaborative single 'First Person Shooter' where Cole called the trio \"the big three\": \"Motherfuck the big three / N****, it's just big me.\" He also called out Drake specifically, reminding the 37-year-old that \"Prince outlived Mike Jack\" - poking fun at Drake comparing himself to Michael Jackson on the song.\n\nCole initially responded with '7 Minute Drill', a \"mere warning shot\" at Lamar on which he mocked his recent albums and work rate. Cole later apologised and removed the song from streaming platforms, calling it \"lame, goofy shit\" to have put out - making the whole rap game believe that the feud was over in just one week.\n\nOn April 13, Drake's first song in the saga 'Push Ups' leaked. In it, he sent numerous shots at Lamar as well as Metro Boomin, Future, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. The OVO founder said Kendrick was not in \"the big three\" of modern music since SZA, Travis Scott and 21 Savage got him \"wiped down\". He further claimed that 50% of Lamar's music is owned by his ex-boss, Top Dawg Entertainment CEO Anthony Tiffith. Rick Ross was the first to respond to 'Push Ups' with 'Champagne Moments', on which he alleged Drake of having cosmetic surgery - specifically a Brazilian Butt Lift - and issued a cease-and-desist to his frequent collaborator French Montana.\n\nLamar didn't reply to Drake immediately, all the while the Toronto native was taunting him online. On Instagram, the rapper told fans that the 'Swimming Pools' star \"has nothing to drop\". He continued to mock the rapper by releasing 'Taylor Made Freestyle' - his second diss track aimed at Kendrick, poking fun at Lamar's working relationship with Swift. 'Taylor Made Freestyle' also featured A.I.-generated verses from Snoop Dogg and Tupac. The 37-year-old eventually removed the song from his social media and other streaming platforms after Tupac's estate threatened to sue him.\n\nAt the end of April, Lamar dropped the brutal six-minute song 'Euphoria' in retaliation, where he criticised Drake for his rap skills, appearance, racial identity, and parenting: \"I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"\n\nOn May 3, Kung-Fu Kenny put out another scathing track called '6:16 In LA'. He called Drake a \"terrible person\" who has plenty of moles in his team. Lamar also revealed Drake gave people $100,000 to find dirt on him but lost it because \"they came with no receipts\". Hours later, Drake rebutted with 'Family Matters'. In seven and a half minutes, he accused Kendrick of domestic violence and infidelity against his partner Whitney Alford. The rapper also claims one of Lamar's children is fathered by his childhood friend and business partner, Dave Free.\n\n20 minutes later, Kendrick released 'Meet The Grahams'. Over the eerie track, Lamar brands Drake as a sexual predator, saying he and Harvey Weinstein \"should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\", forcing Drake to deny that he had \"never been with no one underage\"\n\nLamar quickly followed up with 'Not Like Us' - an upbeat roast track which sees the rapper doubling down his accusations against Drake of paedophilia and exploiting Black artists and culture for financial gain. This time, he added a catchy hook and dance: \"Lemme hear you say OV-Hoe, Say OV-Hoe / Now, stamp and sway, stamp and sway.\"\n\nOn May 5, Drake dropped the latest song in the rap saga 'The Heart, Part 6' - the name being a call back to Lamar's popular single series. He boasted about feeding Lamar the lies he's used in his recent diss tracks, including the information on his hidden daughter: \"We plotted for a week and we fed you the information / A daughter that's 11 years old, I bet he takes it.\"\n\nThe latest developments\n\nKendrick Lamar has yet to respond to 'The Heart, Part 6'. However, 'Not Like Us' peaked at Number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and broke the Spotify record for the most streamed song in one day.\n\nIn other news, the OVO store in Soho, London was vandalised with the lyrics from 'Not Like Us', while wrestler Shawn Michaels has said Drake and Lamar could settle their differences in a WWE ring.\n\nElsewhere, Vince Staples spoke out against the rap battle, saying the rap community \"deserve better\". \"We've been saying for decades that we want people to respect Black music and Black art and Black people,\" Staples explained. \"I think for that to happen, we gotta respect ourselves and they don't make it easy for us, but we gotta try to work a little bit harder at that.\"\n\nOn May 7, a shooting outside Drake's residence in Toronto left a bodyguard seriously injured. There is no confirmation that the shooting is connected to the ongoing feud between Lamar and Drake. While reporting on the story, a TV news anchor slipped up and called Drake a \"raper\" not a \"rapper\".", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyann_sian_williams@nme.com", "name": "Kyann-Sian Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Justice_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poetic Justice (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Electronica", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Electronica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Badass", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Badass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXL_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "XXL (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Rocky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASAP Rocky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Budden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Budden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Dawg_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top Dawg Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradise, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paradise, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SZA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "21 Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

He beat him clean. Easy money.\n\nDrake's more recent collapse this past weekend against Kendrick Lamar and his merry coalition of haters -- Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, A$AP Rocky, and the Weeknd -- was a bit closer, a lot more complicated, and a perfect subject for some intensely disagreeable postmortem analysis.\n\nKendrick Lamar outplayed and out-rapped Drake. But Drake also made a series of missteps, some understandable, some unfathomable, that gave the game away to Mr. Morale. I'll do my best to explain the biggest problems with his overall strategy in this beef.\n\nThe most arguably unavoidable but nonetheless unfortunate mistake that Drake made in this conflict was playing on his opponents' terms without objection. He couldn't resist the opportunity to be seen as a badass and an underdog by fighting several opponents at once. Still, obviously, Drake shouldn't have fought a 20-vs.-1.\n\nThe easy assumption that Drake had no choice but to address everyone at once is questionable. He's Drake. He's the second-biggest musician on earth and the dominant rapper of the past decade and a half. As such, he was in a stronger position than anyone to dictate terms to (1) rappers with much smaller audiences, e.g., Ross, Rocky, and (2) opponents who don't even rap, e.g., Metro, Weeknd, and thus weren't in much of a position to competitively respond in later stages anyway (until ...). Drake should've strategically ignored his secondary opponents and largely limited his disses after \"Push Ups\" to Kendrick, as he was clearly the final boss. His failure to do so left him overextended on \"Family Matters,\" a great song but a wildly unfocused and horribly inefficient diss track. This song was billed as Drake's \"red button\" to eliminate Kendrick, and yet here he was wasting dozens of bars and his coldest flow on the pop singer and the fashion model. This was foolish.\n\nNot until \"The Heart Part 6\" on Sunday evening did he limit himself to addressing Kendrick. But then, it was only to rehash everything he'd already said about Kendrick -- claims that we'll examine shortly -- a couple of days earlier on \"Family Matters\" while now also being very apparently exhausted and forced into the mortifying position of having to rap, \"Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list.\" So even then, his attention was irreparably split. He needed to corner Kendrick faster, earlier.\n\nThe most worrisome sign of Drake's likely fate in this beef was the elaborate rollout for \"Family Matters.\" The song came with a music video in which he crushes a variation of the van on the deluxe cover of good kid, m.A.A.d city and an IG teaser of Drake spoofing Kendrick on \"Buried Alive Interlude\" from Take Care. This was an album-quality premiere.\n\nOf course, Kendrick -- in perhaps the most devastating maneuver in the history of rap beef -- immediately stomped all over \"Family Matters\" with \"Meet the Grahams.\" Kendrick anticipated \"Family Matters,\" as evidenced by the title and the content of \"Meet the Grahams,\" an open letter to Drake's son, Drake's parents, and -- in what is framed as a reveal -- Drake's disgracefully unclaimed daughter. \"Family Matters\" was impressive, but \"Meet the Grahams\" was something else: something occult. The first two words of this song opened a portal to hell: Dear Adonis ... This song transformed the very nature of the conflict, from something petty to something existential, in six minutes and 32 seconds. It was the sort of song that makes you remember everything about where you were, what you were doing, and what you were thinking when you first heard it, especially if you heard it immediately upon release. First, I thought, This song is unhinged, and I feel compelled to turn myself into police custody for listening to it. Second, I thought, Damn -- I bet Drake feels silly as shit for producing a whole music video and everything for that diss he put out 10 minutes ago.\n\nDrake clearly bet the farm on \"Family Matters.\" This was stupid, and he should feel stupid for doing it so exorbitantly. For weeks, Drake postured as a man prepared to battle Kendrick at the pace of social media, with a thousand tricks up his sleeve, but once he got outflanked on Friday night, the Boy froze. He couldn't adapt. He wouldn't survive the weekend.\n\nOK -- let's get into the issues that have got r/Drizzy self-radicalizing with claims of insurmountable bias and stolen elections.\n\nOn \"Family Matters,\" Drake launches a few bombshell allegations: that (1) Kendrick beats his fianc\u00e9e; (2a) Kendrick cheats on his fianc\u00e9e (2b) with white women, hypocritically enough; and (3) Kendrick's label cofounder impregnated his fianc\u00e9e, and now Kendrick is raising another man's son. Taken together, these revelations all sound pretty debilitating for Kendrick, right?\n\nThe problem is that Drake is the worst possible messenger for these unverified details. Kendrick likely anticipated that Drake would lack the self-awareness to understand why this was the case, and that's why he so brazenly dared Drake to press his \"red button,\" with \"Family Matters,\" despite Kendrick clearly anticipating its subject matter. The why is so obvious that many observers probably realized it without even realizing that they realized it: Drake's two big rap beefs before Kendrick -- the battle that he won against Meek in 2015 and then the battle that he lost against Pusha T in 2018 -- both largely concerned lies and misdirection from Drake. He lied about ghostwriting in the beef with Meek and then he lied about paternity in the beef with Push. Why would anyone (other than a stan) now watching this beef reflexively accept any unverified statements coming from Drake at face value, all things considered? Drake is fundamentally untrustworthy in this context. And Drake wasn't prepared to give anyone a reason to trust him in this particular case.\n\nWithout hard proof -- something other than murky interpretations of social media follows -- Drake was in no position to press any of these angles beyond the realm of gossip. He over-leveraged his credibility. \"Meet the Grahams\" dropping only a few minutes after \"Family Matters\" surely stifled this angle in a big way, but really Drake only had so much credibility to spend in the first place. There's a reason why Metro Boomin and Future titled the two albums at the front of this conflict We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You.\n\nThis is also partly why there's a double standard, like it or not, for the competing things Kendrick said (about Drake being a pedophile and having a secret daughter) and Drake (about Kendrick being a \"dog\" and an abuser). Kendrick doesn't have the same reputation for slipperiness and misdirection and lying in rap beefs. Kendrick said it himself, on \"Meet the Grahams,\" in one of the coldest lines from either rapper in this whole beef: Why believe you? You never gave us nothing to believe in. It really is that simple.\n\nSidenote -- this whole notion of winning a rap beef with airtight fact claims is a highly revisionist standard. Dr. Dre didn't prove that Eazy-E was a pedophile. 2Pac didn't prove that he slept with Faith Evans. Jay-Z didn't prove that he came in the Bentley backseat, skeeted in the Jeep, and left condoms in the baby seat; nor did Nas prove that Jay attended any such karate class at age 36. Drake would understand this as well as anyone else -- Meek Mill had a handful of unflattering facts about Drake, but Drake had the better songs and the better strategy for winning Drake vs. Meek. I can't tell you why Drake then chose to imitate Meek in Drake vs. Kendrick, but it obviously hasn't worked out very well for him.\n\nPusha vaporizing Drake with facts was the exception, not the rule; \"The Story of Adidon\" set a somewhat warped, ahistorical standard for Drake vs. Kendrick. Drake appears to have internalized that exception and also learned the wrong lessons from it. Drake betting the farm on his ability to overwhelm his opponent with scandalous assertions was a choice -- ultimately a deeply misguided one.\n\nDrake likely suspected that, if anything, the novelty of his claims about Kendrick made his hand stronger than Kendrick's more predictable allegations about him. But he had this backwards.\n\nConsider the hostile statements that these guys are making about each other. Drake says Kendrick is a philanderer and a woman-beater whose prestigious stature is built upon ugly self-righteous lies. Kendrick says Drake is a deadbeat and a creep with Peter Pan Syndrome and a vampiric relationship with street rappers and Black music in general. Now, note the contrast: Drake was trying to disgrace Kendrick with uncharacteristic revelations about him, while Kendrick was trying to disgrace Drake with characteristic revelations about him -- in other words, things that people were already prepared to believe about Drake. So Kendrick had both an easier job to do and more credibility with which to do it.\n\nWorse yet, Drake struck an uncanny and unflattering posture on both \"Family Matters\" and \"The Heart Part 6\" that on some level seemed to validate Kendrick's unsavory portrayal of him -- not that he's a pedophile, per se, but that he's a creep. Drake sounded creepy white-knighting for Whitney Alford in a grave conversation about domestic violence but then also instructing her to twerk to \"Rich Baby Daddy.\" He sounded creepy flirting with Whitney on a song otherwise dedicated to establishing that Drake is not a name you gon' see on no sex offender list. It was all very airheaded and tone-deaf and childish and consistent with Kendrick's portrait of Drake. Drake's songs raised some uncomfortable questions about Kendrick, sure, but only while further reinforcing all those unflattering things that people were already prepared to believe about Drake.\n\nOn \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake does some wordplay regarding \"Mother I Sober,\" the song from Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, to mock Kendrick's determination to slander him as a pedophile: \"That's that one record where you say you got molested / Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection / This about to get so depressing / This is trauma from your own confessions.\"\n\nThis was a widely ridiculed misstep from Drake, for a variety of reasons really, but mainly because Kendrick is very clearly talking about his mother having been abused on \"Mother I Sober.\" Some saw a foul here, but I disagree -- any expectation of decorum in this beef went out the window as soon as Kendrick opened \"Meet the Grahams\" with Dear Adonis... Drake offered a very tortured misreading of a song that is not particularly complicated or otherwise difficult to understand. Cringeworthy, but whatever -- this is beef, not AP English.\n\nHowever this bit of \"The Heart Part 6\" underscored a larger problem with Drake's mindset throughout this conflict: Drake didn't have a great handle on Kendrick -- not artistically, not psychologically, not personally -- and as a result he often seemed to be attacking a mirage. One of the worst instances of this is on \"Family Matters,\" when Drake once again flips the Michael Jackson vs. Prince motif that these guys keep employing against one another: \"Michael was praying his features would change so people believe that he's actually white / Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites.\" I kinda-sorta understand what Drake is saying here, I guess -- that white artists and white audiences love Kendrick -- but it's such a strangely garbled and pretentious bar that only loosely lands. It's not an especially true or deep insight about Kendrick Lamar. Drake scored his best dig on \"Family Matters\" with \"Kendrick just opened his mouth / Someone go hand him a Grammy right now.\" It's a great bar but also not really about Kendrick so much as it's about a kind of person who overrates Kendrick. It's decently clever but ultimately way too pissy and indirect for the sort of knockout he's trying to achieve. That's Drake's approach to this beef in a nutshell.\n\nKendrick, on the other hand, was constantly calling Drake a deadbeat, a pedophile, and a colonizer on straightforward terms. \"Euphoria\" and \"Meet the Grahams\" both played on Drake's apparent insecurities with bars that produced an eminently recognizable caricature of Drake. So his attacks resonated. Drake based so many of his own attacks in much hazier, half-assed characterizations of Kendrick -- \"Always rapping like you bout to get the slaves freed / You just acting like an activist, it's make-believe\" -- and those attacks simply didn't resonate with listeners in reality. (Compare them to his bars about Rocky, which are spot-on shots at a guy whom Drake clearly has dead to rights.)\n\nOn \"Meet the Grahams,\" Kendrick accuses Drake of hiding a second child -- a daughter. Kendrick doesn't accuse Drake; he addresses a verse to her, rapping, It's not your fault that he's hiding another child. This is presented as Kendrick's own bombshell revelation about Drake. And yet the daughter is probably fake.\n\nKendrick flubbing this angle is now the source of so much \"stop the count!\"-ass outrage among stans who insist that Drake in fact staged a miraculous comeback and won the war with \"The Heart Part 6.\" These people are laboring under a fundamental misunderstanding of Kendrick's game plan, which very obviously succeeded. Kendrick didn't set out to \"prove\" anything -- he's not fucking Phoenix Wright. Kendrick set out to humiliate Drake in a rap beef. Kendrick would do this by inflaming Drake's very apparent insecurities about his cultural belonging, his public image, his parenting, his authorship -- he was waging psychological warfare. Sitting idly while your opponent casually addresses your mom to tell her that you're a pedophile and you should die -- that's humiliating. \"Not Like Us\" -- A minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr -- is humiliating. \"BBL Drizzy\" is humiliating. Goading your opponent into dedicating half a song to establishing that they're not a pedophile -- I can think of nothing more humiliating. Ultimately, Kendrick flubbing the reveal of a second secret lovechild didn't really matter. He humiliated his opponent 10 times over, with other angles, in other ways. He leveraged a bit of his own credibility, on one point, in service of a larger strategy.\n\nDrake, on the other hand, was clearly out of ideas once it was apparent that his reams of innuendo about Kendrick Lamar, Whitney Alford, and Dave Free on \"Family Matters\" wouldn't stick. He unfortunately reserved his utmost savviness for his last, worst diss track, \"The Heart Part 6\" -- naming it that, for one, as a way to stymie Kendrick in any further releases in that series, but also covering his retreat with a big bluff about double agents and false intel fed to Kendrick. It sounded somewhat clever and halfway convincing until you gave it five minutes and thought to yourself: If the big-brained double-agent espionage that he executed brought him to this -- If I was fucking young girls, I promise, I'd have been arrested! -- of what use was the strategy? He spun this little fiction, I suspect, to leave his fans with a soothing rationalization of his loss: it was, uh, somehow, all a part of the plan. Drake sounded so spent on \"The Heart Part 6\" and it wasn't even clear why -- Kendrick released more disses than him! But Drake wasted more energy than anyone. Digging for dirt. Should've been scrambling for quotables.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_charity@theringer.com", "name": "Justin Charity",

Cole track \"First Person Shooter.\" While J. Cole quickly bowed out of the brewing beef, Lamar and Drake have relentlessly attacked one another on tracks that have captivated fans ever since.\n\nDuring the past weekend alone, the rappers ramped up their back-and-forth with the release of four new diss tracks between them. In the tracks, they talk about each other's families and lob unsavory allegations at one another.\n\n\"Not Like Us,\" a diss track targeting Drake that was released by Lamar on the night of May 4, has gone on to become a certified hit, besting his adversary's sales on multiple streaming platforms.\n\nThe track, which serves up an array of cutting insults to a catchy beat, has broken Spotify's single-day streaming record for a hip-hop song with a tally of 6.59 million listens. Ironically, Lamar took the record from Drake, who had previously held the honor through \"Girls Want Girls,\" his non-diss track from 2021 featuring Lil Baby.\n\nOver on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, Lamar's diss track \"Euphoria,\" which was released on April 30, has debuted in the 11th spot, while Drake's song \"Push Ups\" -- which is largely credited with heightening the feud -- trails in 17th place.\n\nAs of Thursday, five of the nine diss tracks exchanged between Lamar and Drake had made it to the top 15 of Apple Music's charts. Showing a consistency with other charts, Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" is in the top spot on Apple Music, while Drake's \"Family Matters\" follows in third place. This is replicated in Drake's native Canada, where the songs sit in identical positions on the country's top 100 Apple Music tracks.\n\nWhen it comes to tracks that have been streamed the most in the U.S. on Spotify, Lamar is also a winner, taking the top spot with \"Not Like Us,\" placing third with \"Euphoria,\" sixth with \"Like That,\" and seventh with \"Meet the Grahams.\" Drake puts in an eventual appearance in ninth place with \"Family Matters.\"\n\nOn YouTube, \"Not Like Us\" has clocked up 28 million views, while \"Family Matters,\" which is the most streamed of Drake's tracks from this current feud on the platform, trails by almost 10 million with a current total of about 19 million hits.\n\nOf note is the fact that one of Drake's tracks is now out of the running. \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" which was released in late April, featured the use of artificial intelligence vocals from Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur. The track was eventually removed from streaming following a threat of legal action from Shakur's estate.\n\nEven when it comes to older work away from the feud, Lamar is proving to be a dominant force. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, rap stats account Hip Hop All Day reported that Lamar's seven-year-old album Damn is currently receiving 8.5 million daily streams -- more than any of Drake's albums on Spotify.\n\nNewsweek has contacted representatives of Lamar and Drake for comment.\n\nDespite occasional collaborations, Drake and Lamar's feud has been going on for more than a decade, with the rappers taking shots at each other through their music and in the media.\n\nOn his track \"Meet the Grahams\" -- which was released on May 3, less than an hour after the unveiling of Drake's diss track \"Family Matters\" -- Lamar accused his adversary of having an 11-year-old daughter that he had hidden from public view.\n\nCanadian musician and actor Drake denied this in his May 5 track, \"The Heart Part 6,\" claiming that he and his associates had purposely planted misinformation to trick Lamar into using it during their battle.\n\nDuring a previous rap beef with Pusha T back in 2018, Drake was accused of having a secret son. Drake confirmed that this was true weeks later on the track \"Emotionless.\"\n\nTo date, Drake's \"The Heart Part 6\" is the last track to have been released by either party in the feud.\n\nOn Tuesday, a drive-by shooting outside a Toronto property owned by Drake left a security guard hired by the artist badly injured.\n\nOfficers found a man with \"serious injuries\" near the scene, and he was taken to the hospital. The victim was a security guard for the rapper, Toronto police confirmed to Newsweek in a statement.\n\nPolice said the suspect fled in a vehicle.

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhether Lamar will respond to Drake with a new diss track. Drake hinted on his previous diss tracks that the feud is only just beginning, and Lamar has continued to put out music slamming his adversary. \"The first one really only took me an hour or two/ The next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you,\" Drake rapped on \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" possibly a nod to future diss tracks. He also rapped on \"Push Ups\" that he's just \"heating up.\"\n\nDrake's \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" is no longer available to stream after Tupac Shakur's estate threatened legal action for the AI-generated use of his voice. Drake posted the song to his X and Instagram accounts on April 19, but deleted them a week later.\n\nDrake and Lamar's beef spans more than the past decade. The two once had a seemingly friendly relationship, collaborating multiple times between 2011 and 2012. But in 2013, their relationship appeared to change after Lamar featured on Big Sean's song, \"Control,\" in which he called out Drake and many other rappers, including Pusha T, Mac Miller and A$AP Rocky. \"I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you,\" Lamar rapped, adding he's \"tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you.\" Fans have since theorized that the two have taken subtle shots at each other in their raps throughout the years. Some interpreted Lamar's shots at artists who use ghostwriters in his 2015 song \"King Kunta\" could be a dig at Drake. Fans and observers of Lamar and Drake's beef have interpreted the feud to be over who could be considered the greatest rapper of today -- though a Rolling Stone analysis of their feud noted the two have different strengths and different claims to the title of \"greatest\" rapper. Lamar has long been known for his critically acclaimed work, including 17 Grammy Award wins and a Pulitzer Prize for his 2017 album, \"DAMN.\" Drake, meanwhile, is commercially dominant: He was the most-streamed artist of the 2010s on Spotify, and he has the most certified digital singles of any artist, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. \"Euphoria\" by Lamar debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 on May 7.\n\nDrake, Lamar and other artists involved in the feud have found recent success on the charts, possibly thanks to the publicity offered by the feud. \"Like That\" has dominated the Billboard Hot 100 since release -- it topped the chart for three consecutive weeks and has remained on the chart for six weeks today. \"7 Minute Drill\" debuted at No. 6 on the Hot 100 after its release, while \"Push Ups\" debuted at No. 19 (the fifth-highest non-Swift song). Lamar's \"Euphoria\" was the No. 1 trending video on YouTube one day after release with 8 million views and debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 11. Drake rose from No. 18 to No. 3 the Billboard Artist 100, which measures the most popular artists in a given week based on sales, streaming and radio airplay numbers.\n\nKendrick Lamar Is Winning His

The track is a response to Kendrick's heavy-hitting \"Not Like Us\" and \"Meet The Grahams.\" Drake announced the song with the caption, \"The Heart Part 6 out now. And we know you're dropping 6 mins after so instead of posting my address you have a lot to address.\"\n\nDrake's track is a clever inversion of Kendrick's own \"The Heart\" series, a collection of songs that have been a recurring theme throughout Kendrick's career. By naming his diss track \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake not only mocks Kendrick's series but also implies a continuation of the narrative, suggesting that he's now taking over the story Kendrick began. In this latest installment, Drake addresses head-on the allegations thrown at him by Kendrick in his last two diss tracks, \"Meet the Grahams\" and \"Not Like Us.\" Moreover, he backs it up with his allegations of his own. However, Drake's latest release isn't sitting well with fans.\n\nKendrick's \"Not Like Us\" featured an aerial map view of Drake's mansion, splattered with red tags to imply sex offenders inhabit the house. Unsurprisingly, the cover art for Drake's response similarly intends to be provocative. It features a screenshot of an Instagram comment left by pgLang co-founder Dave Free, on a post about Whitney Alford's children. Whitney Alford, who is the mother to Lamar's two children, does not follow him on Instagram. The cover art is thus a strategic jab at Kendrick. Drake is referencing his previous accusation on \"Family Matters\" that Alford had been unfaithful with Free, and fathered the son who Kendrick is now raising.\n\nKendrick accused Drake of having an 11-year-old secret daughter he wouldn't publicly claim in his previous track \"Meet the Grahams.\" In \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake flips the script. He claims that OVO planted the story as bait to trick Kendrick. \"We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information / A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it / We thought about givin' a fake name or a destination,\" he raps. This aligns with Kendrick admitting he received the information about Drake's alleged hidden child from someone close to Drizzy.\n\nKendrick also called out Drake and the OVO crew as child molesters on multiple of his diss tracks. Specifically, on \"Not Like Us,\" he referred to Drake and his crew as \"certified pedophiles.\" Drake vehemently denies this, multiple times on \"The Heart Part 6.\" \"I never been with no one underage but now I understand why this is the angle that you really mess with / If I was f**king young girls, I promised I'd have been arrested / I'm way too famous for this sh*t you just suggested,\" Drake insists.\n\nHe also suggests that the allegations were Kendrick's way of misdirecting the beef instead of focusing on music solely. \"Speaking of anything with a child, let's get to that now / This Epstein angle was the shit I expected / TikTok videos you collected and dissected / Instead of being on some dis-direct sh*t / You rather fu*king grab your pen and misdirect sh*t,\" Drake raps. Listeners would later point out that Kendrick had referred to Weinstein on his track, and not Epstein.\n\nOn \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake also brings up Lamar's alleged domestic troubles. For example, he touches on Lamar's relationship with his fiancee, Whitney Alford. Drake alleges she was cheating on and planning to leave Kendrick for allegedly physically abusing her. Drake questions why Whitney hasn't publicly denied the allegations. \"And why isn't Whitney denying all of the allegations / Why is she following Dave Free and not Mr. Morale / You haven't seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild / Dave leaving heart emojis underneath pics of the child,\" he raps.\n\nElsewhere in the song, he continues to suggest that Dave Free is actually the father of his son, rapping, \"Like if Dave really fu*ked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment.\" He also ties together his response to the allegations of grooming minors, specifically Millie Bobby Brown and Kendrick's speculated split from Alford. \"I'm your baby mama's screen saver / only fu*king with Whitney's, not Millie Bobby Brown's.\"\n\nDrake mocks Kendrick's signature series, \"The Heart,\" by naming his diss track \"The Heart Part 6.\" This move mirrors Kendrick's own mockery of Drake's AM/PM series with \"6:16 In LA.\" However, he also took a shot at Kendrick by referencing another song from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. \"My mom came over today and I was like/ 'Mother I-, mother I-, mother I-' / Wait a second, that's that one record where you say you got molested / Aw, f**k me, I just made the whole connection,\" he raps. \"This is trauma from your own confessions / This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected / That's why these pedophile raps is shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive.\"\n\nThis is a direct reference to Kendrick's confessions from 2022's \"Mother I Sober.\" Here, he tells a story of his mom forcing him to admit to a sexual molestation by his cousin that never happened. Kendrick, who is a child at the time tries to convince his mother he hadn't been molested, but it's futile. Kendrick explains her refusal to believe him as being a result of her own childhood trauma. Some argued Drake's reference attempts to make Kendrick relive the experience of not being believed. It's a twist on Lamar's pedophile accusations against Drake.\n\nThe release of Drake's \"The Heart Part 6\" has certainly made waves. As a result, the song garnered a wide array of reactions from fans, critics, and fellow artists alike. Metro Boomin reacted to the track with a meme of Chris Paul. This suggests that despite Drake's efforts, he is still trailing in the battle with Kendrick.\n\nIn the outro of \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake raps on the feud with Kendrick Lamar in the past tense, saying he got \"some good exercise.\" This retrospective view hints at the possibility that Drake may be bowing out of the diss track exchange. Whether or not this puts the beef on pause is still unknown. Regardless, the public is still patiently waiting to see if Kendrick decides to retaliate or not. The ball, it seems, is in Kendrick's court to decide if this is the final chapter of one of Hip Hop's biggest beefs.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "demi_phillips@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Demi Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digi+Phonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Digi+Phonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGLang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OVO Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_Bobby_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millie Bobby Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Morale_&_the_Big_Steppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Childhood trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/05/GettyImages-2103391830-2256x1575.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

According to a new Tweet by Kurrco, the Compton-born performer's diss track \"Not Like Us\" got three times the amount of streams on Spotify than Drake's \"Family Matters\" yesterday. It earned a whopping 12.2M, while Drizzy's garnered 4.2M.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" is what many would consider the most hard-hitting song of the entire beef. On it, Kendrick accuses Drake of being a \"pedophile\" and more. Kendrick's other disses, including \"Euphoria,\" \"Like That,\" and his Future and Metro Boomin collab \"Like That,\" were also streamed more than any of Drake's yesterday.\n\nRead More: Drake Allegedly Dissed Kendrick Lamar On ESPN In 2014 But Forced The Network To Delete The Footage\n\nWhile this is certainly unfortunate for Drake's camp, it doesn't necessarily come as a surprise.

Yesterday, DJ Akademiks hopped online to reveal that he's \"waiting on a few records,\" which led fans to speculate that new diss tracks are on the way. Whether or not anything could outshine what's already been released, however, remains to be seen. As for where Drake's at with all of this, he recently shared a cryptic post on his Instagram Story, highlighting a scene from the series \"A Man In Full.\"\n\nIn the scene, the main character lies dead on the ground, delivering a dramatic posthumous monologue. \"I don't mean this as a criticism,\" he begins. \"Maybe I do.

While fans are loving the beef right now, there is no denying that all of this is very dark and has real-life implications.\n\nThat being said, allegations against Drake pertaining to young women have circulated for years. There has been a pervasive narrative that the artist is around young women too much. People look at his texting habits with Billie Eilish and Millie Bobby Brown as proof. While these women have made it clear that they aren't victims, fans still think it's weird. Meanwhile, in a resurfaced podcast from 2019, comedian Shane Gillis predicted that Drake would be hit with these kinds of allegations.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar Breaks One Of Drake's Spotify Records With A Drake Diss Track\n\nThe comedian notes that he actually likes Drake as an artist.

Kendrick dropped \"6:16 in LA\" which while on the outside looked to be a response, was actually a baited hook which Drake jumped on. Just a few days after its initial release, Drake responded, dropping a highly personal and accusatory attack on Kendrick, with \"FAMILY MATTERS.\"\n\n\"FAMILY MATTERS\" does many things in attack of Kendrick and all of Drake's adversaries, but most notably it accuses Kendrick of domestic violence against his current fianc\u00e9e Whitney. This is only the first of the many accusations we will cover in this issue, but I want to make a statement on the allegations. At the point of this paper's release, these are all still allegations. If any of these allegations are proven true, the rap battle is legitimately over. It should no longer be about music but about making sure that those accused are prosecuted and that those in danger are safe.\n\nKendrick dropped his response \"meet the grahams\" that same night, proving that he had it in the bank the entire time. He then doubled down and dropped the track \"Not Like Us\" the next day. Where Drake accused Kendrick of possible criminal acts, what Kendrick has accused Drake of is fairly disturbing. Kendrick, in a letter to every member of Drake's family including an alleged secret daughter, accuses Drake of trafficking, pedophilia and predatorial behavior. If even a single one of these allegations are true, it cannot be about the music. It has to be about justice, and it has to be objective.\n\nBoth men have accused each other of criminal acts, but in total Kendricks accusations tend to carry a little more weight. That's not to say that Kendrick himself is out of the woods here, as if what Drake said is true in \"THE HEART PART 6\" there needs to be some form of investigation. But if what Kendrick said is true, then Drake would be up there with the likes of Harvey Wienstien and Jeffery Epstein.\n\nThe beef has gotten to a point where I have moral scruples even thinking about how to report on it. I would go as far as to say that this is no longer a beef, it is a trial. The first person to release actual hard evidence against the other instantly \"wins.\" But right now it's important to remember that all of these statements are just rumors and accusations and nothing more. That doesn't mean they don't carry a lot of weight, but it does mean that both artists should be given a fair chance to defend themselves and provide evidence of their innocence.\n\nSo then at this current moment who's the winner? It seems Kendrick has won public favor, and although his claims are still just rumors the vast majority of the public seems to be on his side. Drake's claims of planting evidence didn't seem to be enough to overpower Kendricks lyricism and triple release schedule. Kendrick currently holds the top two spots on apple music, while Drake's response \"THE HEART PART 6\" has more dislikes than likes on youtube. This isn't the first time Drake has lost public opinion, and it is possible he can bounce back, but for now it seems Kendrick is and will remain one of the greatest of all time.", "source": {"uri": "cwuobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_mattesich@cwuobserver.com", "name": "Brandon Mattesich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cwuobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SPECIALEDITION-ONLINESoundBite.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

During the episode, Joe and crew weighed in on the biggest topic in hip-hop: the Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef. The rapper-turned-podcast is adamant that Drake was vanquished by K-Dot and said he believes Drizzy has a real problem on his hands because it appears rappers and producers have joined in arms to see Drake fall.\n\n\"The most important line in this battle starts to come true, which is 'It's not just me. I'm what the culture is feeling,'\" Joe says in the video below, quoting K-Dot's Drake diss song \"Euphoria.\" \"The industry is sending a clear-cut message that you have worn out your welcome,\" Joe continued. \"This is not a Kendrick just West Coast thing. They just went out and tapped [Kendrick] on the shoulder like, 'Big dawg, help.'\"\n\nJoe added, \"This is not just coincidentally we are all mad at Drake's success and we are acting out. This is bigger than that is all I'm saying...It says something that nobody outside of Birdman is saying something in support of Drake. It's not up for question. I'm telling y'all factual music business s**t. It's no longer just I, it's by design. It's calculated.\"\n\nHalf the music industry appears to have a problem with Drake as he has been dissed by several rappers in the last few weeks, beginning with Kendrick Lamar on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That\" and continuing with shots being fired from Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky and others. Drake has tried to hold his own against the onslaught by fighting back with tracks like \"Push Ups,\" \"Family Matters\" and others.\n\nWhile RIck Ross has revealed the reason for his gripe with Drizzy, it remains unclear exactly why Drake has everyone else riled up. Joe Budden himself has speculated that Drake's possible involvement with the record label Gamma may be the reason.\n\nSee Joe Budden weighing in on Drake's issues with other rappers below.", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Budden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Budden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joe_Budden_Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Joe Budden Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birdman (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Rocky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASAP Rocky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/05/attachment-Joe-Budden-Drake-Photo.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Overall, the feud started with some light jabs. However, things have devolved past the point of reconciliation. In fact, it is pretty clear that these two will never be cool. After all, one man is accusing the other of being a pedophile, while the other is making domestic violence accusations. Needless to say, the hate for one another is very real, and there is a real possibility that more songs are released.\n\nFor the last couple of days, Drake has been dealing with some scary situations at his home. On Tuesday, a security guard was shot outside of his home. Subsequently, a trespasser was arrested on Wednesday after trying to get onto the premises. Throughout all of this, Drake has remained calm and seems to be spending time in his home theater. In a video posted to his Instagram story, Drake showcased a scene from the show \"A Man In Full.\" The scene depicts the main character lying dead on the floor, with a voice-over offering up a message that one could interpret as near and dear to Drake's heart right now.\n\n\"I don't mean this as a criticism,\" the monologue begins. \"Maybe I do. But when you die, will people notice? When I go, there are gonna a lot of memories of me by a lot of people, many who hate me. Even so, a person needs to live with vigor. Otherwise, what's the point?\" Whether or not this means another diss track is coming, remains to be seen. Either way, this is a tumultuous time for Drake and his OVO crew.\n\nLet us know what you think of the feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, in the comments section down below.

With his monstrous Drake disses \"Euphoria\" and \"Not Like Us\" doing historic streaming numbers, Kendrick Lamar will likely add the accomplishment to his accolades when the Billboard Hot 100 chart is updated next week. Outdoing Drake on his own turf would be a fitting punctuation for a contest that's seen Kendrick turn the Toronto rapper's customary weapons of internet savvy, infectious hit-making and strategic release tactics against him. In repurposing Drizzy's tools, Kendrick bested Drake at his own game; he beat Drake by being Drake.\n\nKendrick kicked things off by reimagining Drizzy's famous quick-release barrage into an even more potent product. During the Meek Mill, Drake war of 2015, Drizzy dropped his first diss, \"Charged Up,\" only to spin the block and unload the far superior \"Back to Back\" four days later. The move left Meek shell shocked. Kendrick's variation began with \"Euphoria,\" a freeform Drizzy diss he dropped on an unceremonious Tuesday morning. Amid a flurry of quippy insults, Kendrick teased his subsequent back-to-back release. Riffing on Drake's timestamp series, he followed up with \"6:16 in LA,\" a pensive, yet stylish Friday morning drop that oscillates between warning shot and condescending advice. To be sure, the double-play was a moment. But it was also a Trojan Horse.\n\nThat same night, Drake fired what should have been a kill shot, \"Family Matters.\" The shapeshifting diss track was an incisive barrage of quips aimed at The Weeknd, Rick Ross, Metro Boomin, ASAP Rocky and Kendrick himself. In it, he accuses K.Dot of physically abusing his wife. It's an accusation that's as weighty as it is unsubstantiated (for now), and the song itself quickly became a trending topic. But Kendrick quickly delivered a counterstrike with \"Meet the Grahams\" less than 40 minutes later. Laced with a grim Alchemist beat, the track captured even more attention with the claim that Drake had a hidden 11-year-old daughter. The move effectively swallowed Drake's momentum. It was a character decapitation via surprise attack -- think Afro Samurai's dad getting his head lopped off with Justice's hidden third arm.", "source": {"uri": "complex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Complex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_a_berry@complex.com", "name": "Peter A.

And here's why fans are the real losers", "body": "Let's talk about Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar, for real.\n\nNow that the dust has settled and the fiercest hip-hop rivalry since Biggie and Tupac is seemingly over, it's clear who the real losers of this beef are: the fans.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOn March 26, when Lamar threw the first punch of this heavyweight fight with a guest verse on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" longtime fans of both rappers immediately knew the bell had rung.\n\nFor years, Drake's and Lamar's fans have wanted to see the two duke it out. As far back as 2013, the rappers quietly dissed each other pretty consistently, their insults usually relegated to a sneaky line or two on a verse, as on Lamar's 2015 hit \"King Kunta\" (\"I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghostwriter? / What the f -- - happened?\") or Drake's 2013 track \"The Language\" (\"I don't know why they been lyin', but your s -- - is not that inspirin'\"). Only the most keen-eared of listeners were following what was believed to be a healthy ongoing competition between two of the generation's greatest.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Music Drake vs. Kendrick: An exhaustive timeline of the toxic feud dominating the world of hip hop Richie Assaly\n\nAt its core, this was a battle of philosophies. In one corner: Toronto's own, a proven hit-maker whose carefree and relatable approach appeals to those more interested in vibes than substance. In the other, a Pulitzer Prize-winning lyricist from Compton, whose dense and concept-heavy approach connects to those who care more about artistry than mass appeal.\n\nThe question had always centred on which approach is better. What would happen if these two titans stretched their unique skills against each other to determine who is the best? Last weekend, Lamar and Drake did not answer that question. Instead, they participated in something much uglier.\n\nThe unspoken rule of a rap battle is that there are no rules, so this was always expected to get nasty. But Drake vs. Lamar quickly became an information race rather than a competition to determine the better MC. The conflict escalated on May 3 after Drake released \"Family Matters,\" his third Lamar diss track, in which he claims the rapper physically abused his longtime partner. Lamar responded less than an hour later with \"Meet the Grahams,\" in which he likens Drake to Harvey Weinstein, accuses him of sleeping with underage girls and abandoning a now-11-year-old daughter. Both rappers have denied the allegations.\n\nLet's be clear: grown men trivializing pedophilia, domestic abuse and child abandonment is disgusting and is so far from what hip-hop is supposed to represent that we should rethink our love for both guys.\n\nThen again, rap beef has never been about taking the high road. There is a long history of celebrated MCs taking the gloves off and getting dirty. Just listen to Ice Cube's \"No Vaseline\" or Tupac's \"Hit Em Up.\"\n\nWhat is particularly ugly about Drake and Lamar's conflict is how it reflects the darker corners of the internet. Both men were clearly influenced by social media to take things to a cringingly uncomfortable level, as they got caught up in the frenzy of streamers, X users, and Instagram commenters exacerbating the situation and effectively turning their contest of skill into a smear campaign. (The May 7 shooting of a security guard outside Drake's mansion, even if unrelated, couldn't help but add a grim footnote to the whole affair.)\n\nWhile the online judges named Lamar the champion, it cost him a lot to secure that victory. The poster child for politically conscious rap since the release of his 2015 album \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" whose \"Alright\" became a Black Lives Matter anthem, Lamar, over the course of a weekend, stripped away his perceived thoughtful persona in the service of embarrassing his opponent. He revealed a man petty enough to involve an innocent child in his silly ego war, or stupid enough to be tricked into releasing misinformation to a mass audience. Either way, how can Lamar's message of self-growth, unity and Black excellence be taken seriously now?\n\nOn the other hand, Drake has never claimed to be a saint. But for all his warnings to Lamar not to push him too far, this beef went further than he must have expected. He and Lamar must live with the reality that the accusations made last weekend will loom over them for the rest of their lives.\n\nGta We ate at Toronto's New Ho King, the spot Kendrick Lamar name-dropped. Here's what to order Karon Liu\n\nHip-hop is Black music and is supposed to be a rebellious form of self-expression and a collection of stories from marginalized people. In recent days, with the eyes of the world on it, these men allowed it to become a circus instead.\n\nCommercially, last year was a quiet one for the genre, with only four rap songs hitting number one on the Billboard Hot 100, so it's a bit shameful that the thing that has people excited about rap again is rooted in conflict and controversy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDuring a May 4 town hall meeting with Long Beach, California Mayor Rex Richardson for the city's inaugural \"Youth Day in the LBC,\" rapper and actor Vince Staples was asked about the beef. He told fans to consider the bigger picture.\n\n\"We've been saying for decades that we want people to respect Black music, Black art, and Black people,\" Staples said. \"I think for that to happen, we gotta respect ourselves, and they don't make it easy for us, but we gotta try to work a little bit harder at that.\"\n\nWhat did last weekend signal to hip-hop fans? The tabloidization of rap beef, the fall from grace of two of its most celebrated artists and the reality that whoever is considered the best MC now may be determined by who can spill the hottest tea.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5,

The beef has reached all corners of the culture, including sports. Tennis star Naomi Osaka has just declared that she thinks Kendrick has won the beef and really wants the rapper to put out another song like \"Not Like Us.\" Naomi really enjoys the song, and though she is a peaceful person, she can't deny how good it is. The tennis superstar is the latest to pick a winner in what has been weeks of back-and-forths between Drake and Kendrick.\n\nWhen speaking about the beef, Osaka made sure to clarify that she is a \"pacifist\" and \"neutral party\" in the beef. She then ultimately sided with Kendrick. Osaka went on to describe her love for Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" which she has been enjoying on repeat and using for her walk-out music. All in all, Naomi is having fun with what has come out of the feud, and she thinks Kendrick's song is the clear winner and highlight of the whole ordeal.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar Domestic Violence Allegations Resurface Thanks To Mysterious \"okliar\" Website\n\nthe four-time Grand Slam title champion said of \"Not Like Us,\" \"Kendrick dropped some heat.\" She continued, \"That last song is amazing, and I played it while walking onto the court.\" Osaka was asked by a reporter if she thought the Compton rapper should drop another diss track. Osaka replied, \"Yeah. Sorry.\" she then explained why it should lowkey happen. She explained, \"Technically, Kendrick dropped that song, then Drake dropped \"The Heart Part 6,\" so technically Kendrick could drop another two if he wanted to,\"\n\nSubsequently, Osaka brought up a similar topic that was discussed in \"The Heart Part 6,\" when Drake discussed the conflict and said he's \"happy I could motivate you\" since Kendrick's fans are actually \"getting raps\" out of the MC. All signs point to Drake having lost the battle. People are declaring Kendrick the winner, saying Drake's last diss didn't go over that well.

However, their relationship can only be described as complex, given its equal mix of ups and downs. The pair have collaborated on some of hip-hop's greatest hits, boosting their popularity and diversity. Drake and Future enjoyed incredible success from working together. However, every stage of their relationship seems to have been plagued by one issue or the other.\n\nBefore now, there were faint rumors of issues between Drake and Future. However, those rumors intensified after Future and Metro Boomin released their album, We Don't Trust You. The album featured a diss verse from Kendrick Lamar on \"Like That\" targeted at Drake and J. Cole. The hip-hop scene heated up as Drake and Kendrick engaged in a rap feud since the song's release. Besides the Drake vs. Kendrick beef, We Don't Trust You made fans and hip-hop enthusiasts pay more attention to ongoing tensions between Drake and Future. Let us explore the history of Drake and Future's relationship, focusing on their shared successes, controversial moments, and present tensions.\n\nHip-hop enthusiasts most likely remember Drake and Future more for their impactful collaborations. The rappers collaborated for the first time in 2011. Then, Drake jumped on the remix of Future's breakout hit, \"Tony Montana.\" Afterward, they featured in other artists' songs, These included Lil Wayne's \"Love Me,\" Preme's \"DnF,\" and DJ Drama's \"We In This Bitch.\" Besides \"Tony Montana,\" Drake also collaborated with Future on some of his other early projects. These included \"Fo Real,\" the remix of \"Sh!t,\" and \"Never Satisfied.\"\n\nWith their collaborative chemistry formulated, Drake and Future went ahead and became a winning team. In 2015, Drake appeared on \"Where Ya At,\" becoming the only guest feature on Future's DS2, notably primarily produced by Metro Boomin. Afterward, Drake and Future teamed up for the joint mixtape What A Time To Be Alive. Again, Metro Boomin executive produced the successful collaboration. In 2016, Drake and Future combined for more success as the latter appeared on \"Grammys\" from the former's Views.\n\nDrake and Future also went on the Summer Sixteen Tour. After the tour's conclusion, they teamed up for the single \"Used To This.\" This solidified their partnership and the alliance between their record labels, OVO and FBG. The pair enjoyed more successful collaborations in the 2020s, with the songs \"Life Is Good,\" \"Desires,\" and \"D4L,\" featuring Young Thug. Their final collaboration came in 2022 in Future's album I Never Liked You. Drake appeared on \"I'm On One\" and \"Wait For U,\" which sampled Nigerian singer Tem's \"Higher.\" \"Wait For You\" won a Grammy for Best Melodic Rap Performance.\n\nThe first seeds of discord between Drake and Future were sewn in November 2011. The pair collaborated on the remix of Future's \"Tony Montana.\" However, Drake didn't feature on the music video, which hurt Future's feelings. During an interview on The Source TV, Future said Drake's absence from the music video felt like a \"slap in the face.\" He explained that many Atlanta-based artists wanted to get on the song, but he chose Drake over them. He added, \"I really wanted to give Atlanta something different, and it ended up being a slap in my face [because] we didn't complete the whole thought. Just the thought of [Drake] getting on it deserves a salute, but the thought not being completed, the salute comes back.\" Although both rappers settled the issue and worked together again, there was more to come.\n\nIn August 2013, Future ignited more chaos during an interview on Power 106. He revealed he inspired the hook on Drake's hit track \"Started From The Bottom.\" Future further revealed that Drake appreciated the inspiration but didn't give him the recognition he deserved. He said, \"[Drake] bought me a bottle of Louis XIII [de Remy Martin Grande Champagne Cognac] that I never opened up because of this story. I was like, 'Man I don't want a bottle. I need publishing.' But Drake, that's the homie.\"\n\nDrake and Future had more tensions after the latter got allegedly removed from the OVO boss's Would You Like a Tour? Future's exemption from the tour came after his comments about Drake during a Billboard interview. Comparing his Honest album to Drake's NWTS album, Future said, \"Drake made an album that is full of hits but it doesn't grab you. They're not possessive; they don't make you feel the way I do. I want to make you want to fall in love.\"\n\nHowever, Future's team requested Billboard remove those comments as they claimed they were taken out of context. Future also made a post on X (then called Twitter). He wrote, \"Respect to Billboard, disappointed on being misquoted..always love for my fam Drizzy Drake.\" Amid these tensions, there were also reports that Drake and Future were embroiled in a $1.5 million lawsuit over the tour's logistics. The pair seemingly settled the rift as Future rejoined the tour and also participated in Drake's Summer Sixteen Tour.\n\nDrake and Future collaborated with great effect on the highly successful \"Wait For U.\" However, that proved to be their last collaboration as they never actively promoted the song or performed it together. In November 2022, Drake released his joint album with 21 Savage, Her Loss. Two months after the album's release, rumors emerged that Future wasn't pleased with Drake's partnership with 21 Savage on the Her Loss album. After We Don't Trust You's release, investigative fans dug deeper into Her Loss and speculated that \"More M's\" had lyrics from Drake that targeted Future. One such line is, \"I could really go five hours in the stadium/What happened to that n***a claiming OVO? We traded 'em.\" Theorists believe Drake referred to Future, who previously claimed OVO via social media posts and his outfits.\n\nWith speculations rife about the cause of Drake and Future's strained relationship, some theories claimed the rappers feuded over a woman. These theories weren't without cause. In Drake and 21 Savage's \"More M's\" from their Her Loss album, Drake rapped, \"N***as ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it/Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake sh*t/But if I send a verse to they a*s, then they'll take it/Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces.\" Some fans believe Drake's lyrics aimed at Future and proof that their feud was because of a woman. One can interpret the lyrics as Drake complaining about Future flirting with a woman he had an interest in and still acting like a bro in their music collaborations.\n\nDrake also rapped, \"Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages/Probably why these h*es love to shower me with praises/Might've f*cked a rapper, girl, but you ain't f*cked Drake yet.\" The lyrics seemingly show that Drake and Future might have slept with the same woman, leading to issues between them. Unsurprisingly, internet detectives dug further and found that Drake and Future are possibly feuding over a woman named Diana. From the findings, the woman works at a Miami club named Booby Trap.\n\nTo lay more credence to these findings, Drake raps in his song \"Fear of Heights,\" \"He might take you on trips/and he might have some hits/But, baby, not more than me/He might be at the trap and ones/But ain't throwin' more than me.\" The \"trap\" reference from those bars could be referring to Diana, who works at Booby Trap. This might mean Drake's ego was probably hurt after Future and Diana started hanging out.\n\nIn We Don't Trust You's opening track, Future raps, \"You a n***a number one fan, dog/ Sneak dissin', I don't understand, dog/ Pillow talkin', actin' like a fed, dog/I don't need another fake friend, dog/Can't be 'bout a ho, 'cause we sharin', dog/In yo feelings, n***a, why you playin', dog?\" If Drake and Future are really feuding over a woman, then those bars could be directed at Drake, which makes those assumptions more valid. Also, Future and Metro Boomin have a song in their album titled \"Magic Don Juan (Princess Diana),\" which some speculated could be about the same woman. Interestingly enough, the song boasts production credits from Boi-1da, who not only is an in-house producer for OVO but produced Drake's recent string of diss tracks aimed at Kendrick Lamar and the industry as a whole.\n\nAfter rumors of Drake and Future's beef began circulating, fans went back to Drake's For All The Dogs album. In the song \"What Would Pluto Do,\" initially thought to be about Drake hailing Future, Drake raps, \"What would Pluto do? He'd f*ck the h*e, so I did it/ What would Pluto do? He definitely f*ckin' on this h*e, yeah.\" Looking at the lines retrospectively, Drake could have been talking about him and Future sleeping with the same woman. If these theories are true, then it all begins to make sense now. Well, Drake warned everyone in \"Middle Of The Ocean\" from his Her Loss album, where he raps, \"The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods.\" Okay, 6 God, we get you now.\n\nWith the rumors that Drake and Future were beefing over a woman gaining ground, Metro Boomin took it upon himself to clarify things. The producer tweeted, \"Yall n***as stop making stuff up for engagement and enjoy the music.\" Having worked extensively with Drake and Future, some, including the Canadian rapper, suggested that Metro might be at the center of their feud. In December 2023, Metro criticized Drake's Her Loss album despite saying he had no issues with the rapper. However, given Future and Metro's strong bond, it seems clear that Future took a side between the hit-making producer and his former collaborator from Toronto.\n\nSuch a scenario could be playing out now. Metro and Future collaborated on an album, featuring a series of disses targeting Drake including the show-stopping verse from Kendrick Lamar on \"Like That.\" That diss verse began a full-blown rap war between Drake and Kendrick, and no one knows when it will stop. On both \"Push Ups\" and \"Family Matters,\" Drake addresses Future, though he sounds more hurt over their beef than anything on the latter. \"Pluto sh*t make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it/ Leland Wayne, he a f**kin' lame, so I know he had to be an influence,\" Drake raps on \"Family Matters.\"\n\nDrake and Future's complicated relationship is sad to see. The pair have been so great at their musical collaborations. Hence, it won't make sense if they never do a song together. Hip-hop fans who only care about the music will want to see these two geniuses back at the studio working together again. Meanwhile, those who love drama will want more hate between them.

Where Do We Go From Here?", "body": "The low blows thrown during this weekend's volley of diss songs have changed hip-hop's rules of engagement forever -- and may have shifted both Drake and Kendrick's legacies in the bargain.\n\nThis past weekend, after a month of flirting with open warfare, the battle Drake and Kendrick Lamar finally tipped over into three days of exhilarating back-and-forth, and we're still feeling the aftershocks. 2024's biggest rap beef reached its presumed conclusion Sunday night with Drake's despondent \"The Heart Part 6,\" but the online world hasn't stopped reacting. The West Coast is treating \"Not Like Us\" like a triumphant battle cry. Educators are dissecting the lyrical complexities of the disses. Superfans of both artists appear to be spiraling.\n\nKendrick and Drake are the two most prominent rap superstars of the millennial generation, and over the years they've been framed as each other's antithesis -- Kendrick, the tastefully restrained storyteller who pops out every few years when he really has something on his heart to share, versus Drake, the decadent, ever-present workaholic who's never let more than a few months of his 15-year career pass without releasing new material. Their struggle to upstage each other -- culminating in the release of six tracks between them just in the last week alone -- offered no shortage of spectacle. Drake used A.I. to troll Kendrick in the voices of his West Coast heroes to strike a nerve on \"Taylor Made Freestyle\"; Kendrick responded, on \"Euphoria,\" by paraphrasing the late DMX's anti-Drake sentiments, drawing blood in a lower-tech way. \"6:16\" samples \"What A Wonderful Thing Love Is,\" a 1972 Al Green song that features Drake's uncle Teenie Hodges on guitar; Drake promoted \"Family Matters\" on his Instagram by sharing \"Buried Alive Interlude, Pt. 2,\" named for a song from his 2011 Take Care album that featured Kendrick back when things were copacetic. Both rappers also swiped each other's trademarks: Kendrick's \"6:16 in LA\" played on Drake's timestamp-in-a-specific-city song-titling convention, while Drake pulled a Young Thug Barter 6-esque move by naming his final entry \"The Heart Part 6,\" after Kendrick's career-spanning series of the same name.\n\n\"Not Like Us,\" meanwhile, has been read as a message to Drake fans who claim Kendrick isn't capable of making club-ready anthems. But if you ask the right self-appointed internet rap analyst, every move that's been made in this conflict has had a quadruple meaning. What we can say for sure: Regardless of their rivalry, these are men who've been acutely dialed into each other's careers from the very beginning, which meant this standoff was always destined to be about more than deciding who was the best at rapping. It was destined to become what it became -- a high-stakes battle to see who could obliterate whose integrity first.\n\nTruth be told, the apparent end of the beef feels like the closing of a chapter in hip-hop's story, where the teachings of the old guard met the interconnectedness of the new age. When's the last time rappers born in the 80's commanded this much of our attention? Save for Drake, none of the people who came in during the blog era's latter years still mean something to any generation other than their own. Drake and Kendrick's places within the genre's pantheon of legends are pretty much established already. Anything that we get from them now is ornamental, which is why the sheer effort they both put in over the last few weeks has been something to marvel at. It also probably represents the end of an era: There's so little material return for Gen Z's biggest rappers to go toe-to-toe with one another outside of trading insults on livestreams and in interviews that this will likely not happen again. Not like this. This is for people who spent their childhoods watching rap superstars freestyle at radio stations and on BET's after school television lineup in the early-to-mid 2000s. People who remember a time -- even if it was their early childhood -- when an MC was only as good as their staunchest competition, and calling yourself a rapper meant being ready to prove your superiority at any second.\n\nIn that respect, the feud has been a joy to witness. But it's also been a reminder that, at its worst, hip-hop incentivizes the infantilization of grown men who need to be able to hold the attention of people in their teens and early 20s to remain powerful. In their late 30s, these brothers should be receptive and responsible enough to refrain from dangling abuse of women and children as a means to demonstrate dominance. That kind of decency is apparently too much to ask of men fighting desperately for a generational crown. And the consequences of those failures are already revealing themselves.", "source": {"uri": "gq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decadence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decadence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaholic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workaholic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenie_Hodges", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teenie Hodges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troll"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Thug", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Young Thug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/663cfffce27fb80b4913ef0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1497276576.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

A test of lyrical skill and a declaration of superiority that has produced hundreds of classic \"diss tracks\", from 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up to Jay-Z's Takeover.\n\nThe latest beef originally erupted between three of hip-hop's biggest stars - Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole - all triggered by a seemingly innocuous lyric praising their respective careers.\n\nAs tensions grew, Cole dropped out of the fight. However, Drake and Kendrick continue to battle with increasing ferocity - levelling life-changing accusations against each other in a flurry of tracks.\n\nHere's a guide to the battle's history, its fire starters, flashpoints and future.\n\nDrake (above left) - the Canadian actor-turned-musician whose vulnerable blend of rap and R&B has made him the most commercially successful hip-hop artist of the 21st Century. Among his multi-platinum hits are tracks like Hotline Bling, One Dance and Hold On We're Going Home.\n\nKendrick Lamar (centre) - A Compton-born rapper whose compelling rhymes and conceptual vision have seen him named the best rapper of his generation. One of the most inventive lyricists in the game, he tackles big topics like police brutality, black self-worth and his own internal conflicts. In 2018, he became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for music.\n\nJ Cole (right) - Born in Germany and raised in North Carolina, J Cole was mentored by Jay-Z and went on to score hits with songs like Middle Child and Deja Vu. But he grew disenchanted with the trappings of commercial success and began to forge his own path with more introspective, analytical songs, resulting in some of the most popular and successful music of his career.\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was a young up-and-comer, Drake offered him a helping hand by inviting him onto his Take Care album, and giving him an opening spot on his 2012 Club Paradise Tour.\n\nBut in 2013, after the success of Lamar's debut record Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, he made his ambitions clear.\n\nDuring a guest verse on Big Sean's Control, he called out Drake, J Cole, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Pusha T and a host of other rappers, warning them: \"I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you.\"\n\nAsked about the diss, Drake told Billboard Magazine: \"I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was.\n\n\"I know good and well that [Lamar]'s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\"\n\nThe rappers traded a few jibes over the next few years (Lamar memorably boasted that he'd \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes\" during the BET hip-hop awards) but it never seemed particularly serious.\n\nThe initial spark was a gesture towards unity, rather than division.\n\nIn October last year, Drake released his eighth album For All The Dogs, which featured a collaboration with J Cole called First Person Shooter.\n\nIn one verse, Cole suggested that he, Drake and Kendrick were the \"big three\" of the current era of hip-hop.\n\n\"Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick]? Is it Aubrey [Drake]? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league.\"\n\nThe song debuted at the top of the US singles chart, becoming Drake's 13th and Cole's first number-one song.\n\nThe achievement meant Drake tied with Michael Jackson for the most number one singles by a male solo artist.\n\nA week later, Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer replaced them at number one, and the moment seemed to have passed. But privately, Kendrick had taken note - and he wasn't happy.\n\nIn March 2024, producer Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.\n\nHidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.\n\nWith a tightly-wound, expletive-laden delivery, he took aim at Cole's verse, claiming there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\n\nHe went on to call Drake and Cole's best verses insubstantial - \"a light pack\" - and declared he was the Prince to Drake's Michael Jackson.\n\nThe power of the verse can't really be conveyed in print, but when it ends with Lamar promising to put all of Drake and J Cole's \"dogs\" in the \"pet sematary\" - the name of a Stephen King 1983 horror novel - you know a fuse has been lit.\n\n(NB: Lamar doesn't mean literal pet dogs, but the rappers' nearest and dearest. The lyric doubles up as a reference to Drake's album title, For All The Dogs)\n\nIt's worth noting that the placement of Lamar's verse is also significant, as Metro Boomin' is a former Drake collaborator who fell out with the Canadian star.\n\nMetro, whose real name is Leland Wayne (more on him later), produced the majority of Drake's 2015 album What A Time To Be Alive, but a promised sequel never materialised, allegedly leading to bad blood between the pair.\n\nIn 2022, the producer removed Drake from a song called Trance, and unfollowed him on Instagram.\n\nDrake appeared to address Kendrick's verse in a concert in Florida, with a pugnacious message to the crowd.\n\n\"A lot of people ask me how I'm feeling,\" he said. \"I'ma let you know I'm feeling.\n\n\"I got my [expletive] head up high, my back straight, I'm 10 [expletive] toes down in Florida and anywhere else I go. And I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"\n\nTwo weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill from his surprise album Might Delete Later.\n\n\"I got a phone call, they say that somebody dissing / You want some attention, it come with extensions,\" he rapped. \"He still doing shows but fell off like The Simpsons.\"\n\nHe continued by critiquing Kendrick's discography, calling his debut a \"classic\", but his most recent effort - a sprawling double album called Mr Morale and the Big Steppers - \"tragic\".\n\n\"Your third [album] was massive and that was your prime,\" he continued, \"I was trailing right behind and I just now hit mine.\"\n\nHe finished up by saying he still respected Lamar, but wouldn't hesitate to destroy him if the insults continued.\n\n\"Push come to shove on this mic I will humble him.\"\n\nAlmost immediately after releasing 7 Minute Drill, Cole realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".\n\nSpeaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.\n\n\"I ain't gonna lie to y'all the past two days felt terrible,\" he told the audience, explaining that he'd caved into pressure to respond to Lamar's diss.\n\nThe result, he said, was the \"lamest, goofiest\" thing he'd ever recorded.\n\nLike a true rap arsonist, Drake tried to reignite the fire Cole had extinguished.\n\nOn April 13, he released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.\n\n\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.\n\nHe also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.\n\n\"Pipsqueak, pipe down, you ain't in no big three/SZA got you wiped down/Travis got you wiped down/ [21] Savage got you wiped down.\"\n\nHe also tagged Future, The Weeknd and Rick Ross in the song.\n\nWithin hours of Drake's diss, Rick Ross shot back in a track called Champagne Moments, alleging the star had undergone plastic surgery - including a nose job, fake abs and a Brazilian Butt Lift.\n\nThe accusation resulted in Drake's mum texting him to ask if the rumours were true.\n\nHe shared their exchange on Instagram, marking the point where this rap beef went past its sell-by date.\n\nThen, on 21 April, Kanye West sided with Kendrick Lamar, releasing a remix of Like That where he took aim at Drake's major label record deal, suggesting he'd been short-changed.\n\nAnd he dismissed Drake and Cole's lyrics, rapping: \"Y'all so out of sight, out of mind/I can't even think of a Drake line.\"\n\nDrake's attention, however, was solely focused on Lamar....\n\nThe Canadian goaded his Compton adversary by dropping yet another diss track.\n\nCalled Taylor Made Freestyle, it suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Drake used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.\n\nFollowing complaints from Shakur's estate, the song was removed from Drake's social media feeds.\n\nKendrick finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute diss track at the end of April.\n\nTitled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it read like a laundry list of complaints against his sparring partner.\n\nLamar called Drake \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and an \"habitual liar\". He also repeated Rick Ross's dig about Drake's fake abs, and called the star's parenting skills into question.\n\nBut mostly, he said he really, really didn't like Drake.\n\n\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"\n\nLess than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.\n\nIn it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.\n\n\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"\n\nLamar's accusation that Drake \"don't know nothin'\" about raising a son appears to have rankled.\n\nOn Saturday 4 May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.\n\n\"You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad,\" he declared. \"I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad.\"\n\nAmong the song's most shocking allegations, Drake speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).\n\nWithin 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".\n\nEach verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members - his mother, his father and his six-year-old son, Adonis. To each of them, he listed a litany of the rapper's supposed failures.\n\nAmong the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.\n\nDrake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\"\n\nLamar upped the ante even further, on a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.\n\nDrake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof, - with the implication that there was none.\n\n\"Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor ... B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?\"\n\nHe also suggested that many of Lamar's claims had been deliberately planted by a fake informant, in the hope the star would unwittingly rap about them.\n\n\"The one's that you're getting your stories from, they're all clowns,\" Drake rapped. \"We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that's 11 years old, I bet he takes it.\"\n\nThe war of words has quietened for now, but it feels like an uneasy silence. Will either star be able to walk away?\n\nWhatever happens, the feud has been good for business. Both Push Ups and Like That are safely nestled in the US and UK charts, with the latest diss tracks certain to follow.\n\nAnd while the question of \"who won\" still lingers, Billboard magazine reports that streams of Lamar's back catalogue have increased by 49% since the weekend, while Drake's have dropped by 5%.\n\nLamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us, with is potentially libellous hook, has also become a club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release.\n\nThere are also a lot of conspiracy theories flying around - the main one being that Universal Music stepped in to stop the feud. TMZ has run a report saying that's not true, however.\n\nThings took a darker turn on Tuesday, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot. It's not clear whether the incident was connected to the rappers' feud, but the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London certainly was.\n\nMeanwhile, there are signs that some listeners are growing tired of the constant back and forth.\n\n\"This whole feud has started to reveal itself to be an ouroboros of attention and social-media commentary more than any actual referendum on two rappers' abilities,\" wrote Rolling Stone magazine's senior music editor Jeff Ihaza in an opinion column on 2 May.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Lamar, the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper from Los Angeles, says Drake is a deadbeat dad with an entourage full of sex offenders, and fetish for underage women.\n\nDrake, the Toronto-born superstar, accuses Lamar of spousal abuse, and Lamar's wife of infidelity. Each says the other suffers from deep-seated racial self-hatred.\n\nThis is ugly, petty, spiteful stuff, and, as listeners, we'd be smart not to take much of it literally. It's two guys with active minds and huge egos channeling their creativity into hurting each other's feelings. If we're not bracing for exaggeration, we're doing it wrong.\n\nStill, for the combatants, there's room for self-awareness. And on Saturday night, as Drake absorbed yet another lyrical beatdown from Lamar, he appeared to show some by allegedly deleting a picture of himself alongside retired NBA star Karl Malone from his Instagram account.\n\nIt happened as Not Like Us, the latest and catchiest of Lamar's diss tracks, and the one alleging that Drake cavorts with teenage girls, set the Internet ablaze. We saw footage of people jamming to it at pool parties, before it spawned a TikTok dance challenge. Against that backdrop, a photo with Malone, a famously absent father to a son whose mother was just 13 when Malone, then a college student, impregnated her, would only supply Drake's trolls and rap rivals with more material.\n\nSo the photo disappeared around the same time the Boston Bruins eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs from the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the day before the Blue Jays dropped a sloppy 11-8 decision to the Washington Nationals. And it unfolded four weeks after the Raptors put a flaccid end to their worst season in more than a decade, finishing 25-57, last in the Atlantic Division.\n\nWATCH | How Drake-Kendrick feud started:\n\nBut Drake might have suffered the most bruising loss. He's the swaggering rap star who is now the punchline in thousands of social media jokes, and the famous mega fan who, for right now, can't even use sports as a safe space.\n\nOn Push-Ups, Drake poked fun at Lamar's stature and fitness regimen, then enlisted A.I. versions of Tupac and Snoop Dogg for the follow-up, Taylor Made. He figured the one-two punch would carry him to a win; instead, Lamar responded with the sustained, single-minded aggression of a young Aaron Pryor. He landed body blows on Euphoria and 6:16 In L.A., and on Not Like Us, Lamar went for the knockout. He didn't drop Drake for the count, but the endless stream of reaction videos, dance clips, and parody skits prove he helped turn a large portion of the Internet against the world's most popular rap artist.\n\nIncluding sports stars. Saturday night, there was former NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson, dancing to Not Like Us in a clip posted to social media. And Gavin Lux of the Los Angeles Dodgers, using the song as his walk-up music. On Tuesday, here came the USC Trojans, using the song as the soundtrack to a sizzle reel.\n\nIt's a jarring turnaround.\n\nUntil now, Drake had enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the sports world. The Raptors' practice facility, the OVO Athletic Centre, bears his company's branding, and Scotiabank Arena houses The Sher Club, Drake's exclusive, expensive, members-only lounge. From there, the cool factor compounds. Sports stars like DeMar DeRozan can affirm their importance by hugging a multi-platinum rapper on the sidelines. Drake gets an ego stroke when he joins the layup line with the University of Kentucky's basketball team, whose blue-blood status is in turn reinforced when Drake shows up on court.\n\nThe blowup with Lamar broke that virtuous circle.\n\nOn Saturday an NBA playoff broadcast used Not Like Us to take viewers to commercial break. And comedian Roy Wood Jr. pointed out that if HBCU marching bands haven't perfected the song yet, they will have by football season.\n\nDrake has five Grammys, nine-figure reported net worth, and the esteem of sports stars world wide. So how did he become the butt of so many online jokes?\n\nUnforced errors, partly.\n\nIn Euphoria Lamar accuses Drake, who is biracial, of being culturally disingenuous, and masking his insecurities with an exaggerated Blackness.\n\nDrake, in response, uses Family Matters to label Lamar a phony activist who is \"always rapping like you tryna get the slaves free.\"\n\nLater, in The Heart Part 6, Drake claims to have duped Lamar by leaking false information to him, and that Lamar should have fact-checked before spinning falsehoods into diss tracks.\n\nBut it all culminated in the energetic, infectious Not Like Us, already a front-runner for Song of The Summer, and a tailor-made sports team battle cry. On Tuesday it racked up nearly 11 million Spotify streams, eclipsing a one-day record previously held by... you get one guess who.\n\nSo if Drake supplied the raw material for Lamar's first certified nightclub banger, the strategy was akin to baiting Bonds into swinging at a fastball down the middle. If Barry swings, high-five your buddies. Your plan worked. But when he sends the ball 500 feet into McCovey Cove for a three-run homer, his plan worked better.\n\nStill, I feel for Drake.\n\nWhen I tweet something dumb I can't even stand reading the replies, so I can't imagine scrolling social media when every other joke is on me. And if I turned on the game as an escape, only to hear a song built on insults aimed my way? Cancel cable and every streaming service. No smartphone. Reconnect the landline. Send me back to 1994, when I lived blissfully offline.\n\nAnd if you, like me, have acute rap beef fatigue, consider how lucky we all are that the Raptors missed the playoffs. Ponder the dilemma that would have faced game-day DJs at Scotiabank Arena and Jurassic Park.\n\nPlay the hits?\n\nNot when the hottest track on the planet takes shots at the home team's Global Ambassador.\n\nAnd \"Family Matters\"?\n\nCool, till you catch people laughing \"get the slaves freed,\" and get an ugly reminder that Black history is still a joke to some folks.\n\nWe're all better off with the way it all timed up. Raptors, Leafs, and Drake all taking L's in succession, everybody's off-season underway by Mother's Day. From here, another rebuild -- a roster for the Raptors, maybe that and the front office for the Leafs.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [],

This was a wrestling match level mudslinging and takedown by any means necessary - women & children (& actual facts) be damned.\"\n\nHis post continued to read, \"Same audience wanting blood will soon put up \"rip\" posts like they weren't part of the problem.

Cash XO co-founded XO Records with The Weeknd, another artist Drake is at odds with.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:\n\nThe quarrel between Drake and Lamar began after Lamar dropped a scathing verse against Drake that was featured on Metro Boomin and Future's \"We Don't Trust You\" album.

In 2011, the \"Humble\" rapper appeared on Drake's second album, \"Take Care.\" Although he was only a feature on a track, it had a lasting impact on Drake, who invited Lamar and fellow rapper A$AP Rocky to open for him on his Club Paradise Tour.

Overall, this feels like the biggest story in North America. There is an election this year, however, most people are debating between these two as opposed to Donald Trump and Joe Biden. At the end of the day, pop culture is front and center in our lives, and this beef is taking over the moment. For now, many believe the feud is over as Drake seemingly waved the white flag on \"The Heart Part 6.\" That said, there is always a chance that someone comes through with a new song.\n\nMeanwhile, those who have ever been around Drake and Kendrick in the past are coming out of the woodwork to give their takes on what is happening. One such person is Marcellus Wiley, who used to be a co-host on the ESPN show Sportsnation. In a new video posted to Twitter, Wiley claimed that Drake was on the show in 2014 and dissed Kendrick Lamar on it. Subsequently, he allegedly did everything he could to block the interview from going out. He even allegedly threatened to not host the ESPYs.\n\nOverall, Wiley doesn't have proof that this happened and simply expects the audience to take his word for it. That said, Drake was definitely a regular on ESPN at the time. This would have been a year after the \"Control\" verse, which Drizzy was reportedly offended by. However, there is no concrete proof that he did this, and considering the footage was scrubbed, we will probably never see it with our own two eyes.\n\nLet us know what you think of this revelation from Marcellus Wiley, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that this actually happened? Do you think that Drake is going to come through with a new track after what just went down on \"Not Like Us?\" Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the music world.

However, Drake decided to contribute to his reputation as an outsider with a questionable grasp on hip-hop culture by making it clear he took exception to the jab in the wake of the song's release and asserting he more than had what it took to go bar-to-bar with Kendrick.\n\nHe was recently given the opportunity to put that hypothesis to the test courtesy of the beef that exploded in April following a very lengthy build-up, and while the jury is still out when it comes to deciding a winner, the court of public opinion currently seems to be in Kendrick's favor based on how the needle shifted in the wake of the release of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nYou could argue Kendrick fired the first shot when he implied he was a class above Drake (and J. Cole) alongside Future and Metro Boomin on \"Like That,\" but the self-proclaimed 6 God really opened the floodgates when he dropped \"Pushups,\" which sparked the war of words that has escalated to the point of no return.\n\nNow, the beef has gotten some additional context courtesy of Marcellus Wiley, the former NFL defensive end who spent five years as the co-host of SportsNation on ESPN.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wiley hopped on YouTube to address the Drake-Kendrick beef while recalling his time with The Worldwide Leader, saying the Toronto rapper sat down with SportsNation for an interview that was supposed to air before he hosted the ESPYs in 2014.\n\nWiley said Drake used a portion of the interview to call out Kendrick for failing to match his commercial success while making it clear he didn't think Kendrick could hold a candle to what he was able to achieve (which, in fairness, reflected the reality of the rap scene at a time where Drake was on top of the world).\n\nHowever, the interview never made it to air, which Wiley asserts stemmed from Drake issuing an ultimatum after realizing he may have made a mistake, saying, \"You went on our show, dissed this dude, then hid behind your team, let them call our bosses and told them, 'Hey dog, if y'all let that interview go, I'm not hosting the ESPYs.'\"\n\nWiley (who, like Lamar, hails from Compton) also said he reached out to Kendrick's camp in the wake of the interview to let them know what went down, and while he declined to issue a response at the time, it sounds like there was a reason he was armed with plenty of ammo to fire back with as soon as Drake decided to press the issue this year.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com", "name": "Connor Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsNation_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SportsNation (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcellus_Wiley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcellus Wiley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_(culture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop (culture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_(publisher)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wiley (publisher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

In his victory-clinching \"Not Like Us,\" Lamar renews criticisms about Drake's cultural identity and alleged inauthentic relationships with fellow artists.\n\n\"You called Future when you didn't see the club/Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up/21 (Savage) gave you false street cred,\" Lamar rapped. \"You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars/ No, you not a colleague, you a f--- colonizer.\"\n\nFor years, Drake has faced allegations that he cozies up to rap artists and replicates their sound and style for personal gain before moving on to his next project. Rappers like Earl Sweatshirt, Rick Ross and Pusha T have spoken about the purported pattern, and claims of Drake being a \"culture vulture\" have swirled for at least a decade.\n\nMost of the allegations, going back nearly a decade, lie in adapting phony accents, musical similarities and covers, appearances with burgeoning artists and unproven claims of theft.\n\nWhen Drake released his 2015 hit \"Hotline Bling\" on his Beats 1 Radio Show \"OVO Sound,\" it was initially billed as a \"Cha Cha remix,\" referring to Virginia singer DRAM's earlier burgeoning hit. As time went on, though, Drake distanced \"Hotline Bling\" from the song amid allegations that he essentially stole the track. DRAM has been vocal about his stance, writing in a post on X that fall, \"Yeah, I feel I got jacked for my record...But I'm GOOD.\"\n\nDrake told The Fader in 2015 that \"Hotline Bling\" samples Timmy Thomas' '70s hit, \"Why Can't We Live Together.\" He chalked up similarities between \"Hotline Bling\" and \"Cha Cha\" to the artists using a similar \"riddim,\" sounds or riffs that act as anchors in Jamaican music.\n\n\"Imagine that in rap, or imagine that in R&B,\" Drake said. \"Sometimes I'll pick a beat that's a bit, like, sunnier, I guess is the word you used, than usual, and I just try my hand at it. And that's kind of what 'Hotline Bling' was. And I loved it. It's cool. I've been excited by that sort of creative process.\"\n\nGabe Niles, who produced \"Cha Cha,\" has said the song does not sample Thomas' track.\n\nSimilar controversies have followed Drake throughout his career, making Lamar's criticisms the latest in a long history of claims that Drake's industry practices may be exploitative. But for Drake's defenders, the issue isn't a matter of exploiting Black cultures and artists, but of race.\n\nSocial media posts about Lamar's lyrics quickly dissolved into conversations about race in the hip-hop and rap industry. Drake's fans have long held that his biracial identity -- he is both Black and white -- along with his Canadian nationality negatively impacts his standing in the industry.\n\n\"People cannot fathom that they gave drake (a canadian biracial man) the legacy they NOW feel kendrick (an american black man) should've had,\" one person wrote in a post on X. Another added: \"You don't get to call out a biracial person for their blackness level. That's colorism, and I don't f with that.\"\n\nAmara Pope, who has spent years studying and writing about Drake's racial complexities, said Drake's place in the industry is skewed by both his race and nationality.\n\n\"I think that people have questions about Drake's authenticity when it comes to his Blackness based on, not necessarily what Graham has done,\" Pope said, referring to his real name Aubrey Graham, \"but the dominant belief ... that Canadians are exclusively white and that Canadian music exclusively folk or country and R&B and hip-hop is exclusively created for Black Americans.\" Pope added that Drake represents his biracial, Canadian and Jewish roots in his music.\n\n\"Drake, for a long time, has talked about not being Black enough to be in hip-hop music,\" Pope said.\n\nDrake did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but he has rapped about not feeling \"Black enough\" for the industry and spoken in interviews about feeling \"excluded\" because he is half-white.\n\n\"Sometimes some of my Blackest friends can be just as cruel by making you feel excluded or making you feel like, 'You can't get in on this,'\" he said in 2019 during an interview with Rap Radar.\n\n\"I associate myself as a Black man,\" he said, lamenting feeling that he is not often celebrated as a \"Black artist\" for his accomplishments. \"It's something that I just acknowledge and I keep it moving.\"\n\nA.D. Carson, a professor of hip-hop and the global south at the University of Virginia, doesn't see it that way, though. Valid criticisms of Drake shouldn't be flattened into a tragic story, he holds, but should be taken seriously. Drake rose to popularity with melodic hip-hop music rooted in vulnerability and transparency, but this has since seemed to slip into an apparent series of personas that sometimes feels inauthentic and further removes Drake from the sound that fans first fell in love with.\n\nCarson describes Drake's alleged behavior in the music industry as \"cultural tourism.\"\n\n\"Everything he is in proximity to, he appropriates and mimics it,\" Carson said of Drake. \"He's able to genre-hop through identity theft, and it's genre-bending in a way that we definitely critique white artists doing. He's more insulated from it because of what folks call 'biracial identity.'\"\n\nHe added: \"Kendrick is asking, 'what is the cultural identity? What are those things that you possess outside of the means by which you're going to sell your next product?' Those are the questions.\"\n\nDrake has drawn criticism for dabbling in sounds from underground subcultures and artists -- like Caribbean dancehall, U.K. grim, house music and New Orleans bounce, to name a few. He has addressed the backlash, saying that he is simply appreciating the music and supporting lesser-known artists.\n\n\"I hate that people think that me being into music from these kids that are trying to make it and build a name for themselves is like, 'Oh that's some culture vulture,'\" he said in a 2019 interview. \"What does that even mean? I don't understand. Would you rather me not acknowledge anything or not support? That's some real confused hater sh---.\"\n\nCritics like Lamar have equated this support to exploitation. In \"Euphoria,\" Lamar's initial response to Drake's \"Push Ups\" diss track, he implied that Drake's songs with Black artists result from his supposed identity issues.\n\n\"How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?\" Lamar raps.\n\nMeanwhile, Rick Ross, in a diss track of his own, hurled insults about Drake's race, calling him \"white boy.\"\n\nHip-hop, like all music genres, has racial dimensions and cultural affiliations. Conversations -- and criticisms -- of whiteness in the industry have existed within the genre for decades, especially as it has grown into a lucrative, culture-defining, billion-dollar business. Carson said that conversations about Drake's biraciality in the industry should not be used to dismiss the valid criticisms of his allegedly exploitative music practices within hip-hop.\n\n\"Drake's ability to operationalize Blackness insulates him from critique. Somebody would say, 'Well, you can't appropriate Blackness if you are Black,' Carson said. \"Nobody is gatekeeping Drake out of Blackness. Folks are asking, 'How does he benefit from white supremacy?'\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The sheer excitement, the intrigue, the unpredictability, the adrenaline rush, the bloodlust: who can resist? And in exchange for their courage, discipline and possibly even their lives, we reward our gladiators handsomely. It's payday for the poetic, profit-seeking, pride-protecting feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, easily the landmark competitive event of our time.\n\nRappers are our modern gladiators (and poet laureates). And thanks to social media and the fact that every major media organisation worth its salt - the BBC, the New York Times, the Guardian - has dedicated prominent real estate to cover and contextualise the beef blow-by-blow, track-by-track, the world is their colosseum. Are you not entertained?\n\nWe see all the modern tools of warfare deployed: high- and low-tech espionage, infiltration of enemy camps, artificial intelligence (Drake released a record with AI-generated verses from Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur, both, like Lamar, west coast icons). There has been kompromat (including accusations of Ozempic usage and Brazilian butt lifts), leaks, disinformation events, racial propaganda, social media hostilities. This has resulted in numerous direct, highly innovative \"diss\" tracks: some to make you think, some to make you dance, some to make you TikTok - all to defame the opponent.\n\nSo why are we entertained? There seems genuine enmity between the two. But there is also the cultural dissonance. Lamar and Drake aren't gangsta rappers, known for hurling epithets and busting off shots in nightclubs. They spring from the parallel tradition of hip-hop which is still highly entertaining but full of substance, and drenched in social nourishment (both are influenced by Phonte Coleman, perhaps the most influential rapper you've never heard of). Though Drake focused on more commercially appealing music often targeted overtly at \"the ladies\", Lamar specialised in socially conscious issues, documenting the plight of the downtrodden (or as Drake described him: \"Rapping like you tryna get the slaves freed\"). Nevertheless, neither the ladies' man nor the preacher man are shy about holding their ground in battle.\n\nAs they duke it out, it's worth remembering that both have their music released under the umbrella of the same record conglomerate - Universal Music Group (UMG). UMG is led by the 64-year-old British record executive Sir Lucian Grainge CBE - who may well be looking at the balance sheets and skipping to work each day.\n\nThe barbs are clever, but they are not all pretty, and that may eventually give the label executives pause. On the track Family Matters, Drake accused Lamar - a Pulitzer prize-winning megaphone for socially important matters - of being a domestic abuser. On They Not Like Us, Lamar accused Drake of being a \"certified paedophile\". It went from jousting, to sledging, to accusations of serious criminality - basking all the while in sustained profitability.\n\nThe insults don't have to be true. We know that feuding rappers cultivate similar relationships with the truth as tobacco and oil companies: they obfuscate, exaggerate, fabricate. On 2001's genre-upping diss track Ether, the rapper Nas accused Jay-Z of being \"36 in a karate class\". Jay-Z was only 32 years old at the time. By the time Jay-Z was 36, he was boss of the record label Nas was signed to.\n\nBut that was a confrontation whose details were mainly followed by rap aficionados. This one is mainstream. The accusations - true and false - make news. The likes of MTV News and Hot 97 may have covered the rap beefs of previous decades, but it took Biggie and Tupac being murdered for such feuds to become hard news stories. These days Drake, in terms of popularity and record sales, is a global pop star approaching the level of Prince or Michael Jackson. When he responded to Lamar's accusations, headlines were written worldwide. \"Drake denies allegations of underage relationships in Kendrick Lamar song\" said the BBC. Mud sticks in the public mind, and in the mind of law enforcement. On both sides of the Atlantic, rap lyrics are used as evidence against rappers facing criminal trials.\n\nAnd what is the wider effect of this verbal boxing match? It is in too many ways a tale of collateral damage: of two famous black men tearing each other down as entertainment for the masses, enriching themselves, bolstering stereotypes and all the while diminishing others who look like them.\n\nAnd how will it end? In the 90s, Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, beloved by many rappers, would have intervened to calm things down. But after all that has been said here, it is hard to envisage genuine reconciliation.\n\nJay-Z, as ever, lyricised wisely: \"Nobody wins when the family feuds.\" Given the amount of mud both Kendrick and Drake are now covered in, whoever wins The Great Rap War of 2024 lays claim to what may be a short-term pyrrhic victory. In the long term the only person who really wins from \"beef\" is the owner of the cow. So congratulations are due to the Universal Music Group.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The verse caused the two rappers to go back and forth on scathing diss tracks for the last month.\n\nOn May 5, Drake uploaded the latest song in the saga 'The Heart, Part 6' to YouTube. In the song, he denied all of the allegations made by Lamar including him having a hidden daughter and being a sexual predator.\n\nThe OVO Founder also claimed that he fed false information to the Compton rapper, rapping: \"We plotted for a week and we fed you the information / A daughter that's 11 years old, I bet he takes it.\n\nHe continued: \"You gotta learn to fact check things and be less impatient / Your fans are rejoicing thinkin' this is my expiration / Even the picture you used, the jokes and the medication / The Maybach glove and the drug he uses for less inflation / Master manipulator, you bid on the speculation.\"\n\nAccording to XXL, the clip has over 1million dislikes - the most out of any song in his feud with Lamar. Beneath The Hip-Hop Wolf's blog post, some fans believed this was due to a \"Drake hate train\".\n\nOne user wrote: \"The hate train is crazy. He needs to disappear for a minute. Music will be so trash that folks will start wanting his music. Kendrick [is] not consistent enough. So enjoy now. I remember Jay-Z actually going through the same thing as far as people turning on him.\"\n\nOn May 3, Lamar followed up with '6:16 in LA'. Hours later, Drake released 'Family Matters', and Lamar responded 20 minutes later with 'Meet The Grahams'. The following day, the Pulitzer Prize winner dropped 'Not Like Us' - which is now the most streamed rap song on Spotify and the highest-charting song from the feud, currently sitting at Number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nQuestlove condemned the conflict, saying: \"This was a wrestling match-level mudslinging and takedown by any means necessary - women [and] children [and] actual facts) be damned. Same audience wanting blood will soon put up 'RIP' posts like they weren't part of the problem. Hip-hop is truly dead.\"\n\nVince Staples has echoed the same sentiment, believing rap \"deserves better\". \"We've been saying for decades that we want people to respect Black music and Black art and Black people,\" he reasoned. \"I think for that to happen, we gotta respect ourselves and they don't make it easy for us, but we gotta try to work a little bit harder at that.\"\n\nIn other news, one of Drake's bodyguards has been shot outside of Drake's Toronto residence. Later, a man was arrested for breaking into Drake's mansion a day after the shooting.\n\nElsewhere, Drake and Lamar's label Universal Music Group said they're not going to step in and stop the feud.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyann_sian_williams@nme.com", "name": "Kyann-Sian Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OVO Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maybach Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXL_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "XXL (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Staples", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vince Staples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questlove", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Questlove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/drake-kendrick-lamar-@-2000-x-12702.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 285}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1478, "textEnd": 1483}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He then released Taylor Made Freestyle, featuring AI versions of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, but the Shakur estate forced him to remove it.

Drake recently returned fire at Kendrick Lamar with \"The Heart Part 6,\" a song that, depending on who you ask, sounds like Drizzy is either looking to keep the battle going or bowing out. The record arrived on Sunday night (May 5) and mainly featured the artist addressing Lamar's claims that he's a pedophile, which Lamar laid out in detail in \"Meet the Grahams\" and \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nDrizzy and K. Dot stans listened to the song with bated breath, hoping that the track would give them the validation they needed to crown their favorite artist as the winner of this much-anticipated battle. After five minutes of Drake's follow-up record, the people voiced their opinions across the internet, with mixed reviews painting a picture of unfamiliar territory for Drizzy -- there was a chance that he could actually lose the battle of public opinion.\n\nWhile swathes of folks can agree that the song was one of the better displays of Drizzy's raw talent for rapping throughout this war, other people opined that there were too many duds on the track, taking away from what could have been a knockout blow to Kendrick Lamar. Or, at the very least, the equalizer. Thus, various spectators have opted to crown Kendrick Lamar the winner of 2024's great rap war. But what went wrong for Drizzy?

This is like Pepsi and Coke battling with each other,\" said Choclair, who is a four-time Juno-award-winning rapper.\n\n\"I would call this the biggest battle I've ever witnessed in hip hop,\" said Shad, who is a hip-hop historian and producer of the TV series Hip-Hop Evolution.\n\nChoclair, who is considered a hip-hop pioneer in Canada, said that diss tracks and battling, which is when two rappers trade verbal jabs with each other, is a natural part of hip-hop culture.\n\nShad said that battling has been around since the beginning of the genre and it exists in all of the elements of hip-hop, including breakdancing, graffiti, DJing and rapping.\n\nThe point of a diss track is about proving who the best rapper is, Shad said.\n\n\"Diss tracks are these ... important moments in hip-hop history where you know two greats are going at each other and then you find out who was really the greatest of that moment.\"\n\nOther notable battles in hip-hop history include KRS-ONE vs. Marly Marl and the Juice Crew as well as Jay-Z vs. Nas.\n\nDrake and Lamar have made some pretty serious accusations against each other in their ongoing battle.\n\nOn May 7, one of Drake's security guards was shot outside of the rapper's multimillion-dollar mansion in Toronto.\n\nPeople were quick to make a connection between the shooting and the ongoing feud between him and Kendrick, but there is no known evidence of a connection at this point, according to Toronto police.\n\nShad said that hip-hop was started as an alternative to violence and that he would like to see people honour that history.\n\nChoclair said that rap battles were traditionally used to generate excitement among fans and to see who the best lyricist was.\n\nHe said that there is always a potential for violence with rap beefs, but he hopes that it remains artistic and that \"cooler heads will prevail.\"\n\n\"In the '90s, people were getting killed over battles ...Tupac and Biggie, they were both killed,\" Choclair said. \"Nobody wants to see that happen again.\"\n\nHave more questions?

This seemingly kicked off with Megan Thee Stallion, who dropped \"Hiss\" on January 26th. The track, now RIAA-certified gold, allegedly took aim at Nicki Minaj, especially for its infamous \"Megan's Law\" bar, a dig at Minaj's husband being a registered sex offender. Minaj fired back with a social media tirade and her response record, \"Big Foot\" on January 29th.\n\nThis seems to have opened the door for other rappers to air their grievances in music and on social media. As new beef continues to brew, let's recap the rap feuds that have kept our playlists and timelines juicy.\n\nNicki Minaj vs. Megan Thee Stallion\n\nThis feud has seemingly been brewing since the release of their joint single, \"Hot Girl Summer\" in 2019. Nicki Minaj accused Megan Thee Stallion of trying to make her consume alcohol, knowing she was trying to get pregnant at the time. The two appeared to trade subliminals until finally putting it all on the floor.\n\nIce Spice vs. Latto\n\nThese two spent much of 2023 exchanging subliminals. This seemingly took a turn when Latto was seen previewing her track, \"Sunday Service\" on social media with an Ice Spice video playing in the background. While Latto maintained this was unintentional, Ice Spice took it as a diss and dropped \"Think U The Sh**.\"\n\nDrake vs. Rick Ross\n\nThis was one of the most unfortunate beefs, considering that Drake and Rick Ross have a long history together. After Kendrick Lamar dissed Drake on \"Like That,\" Ross trolled Drizzy across social media, accused him of sending a cease-and-desist to French Montana, and even dissed him directly in \"Champagne Moments.\"\n\nThe origins of their beef has been a topic of speculation, as the pair were once close friends. Drake was even featured on Future's 2022 album, \"I Never Liked You.\" They even scored a Grammy Award together for the album's single, \"Wait For U,\" which also featured Tems. Sadly, Future allowing Kendrick Lamar to diss Drake on \"Like That\" was a clear indicator that he was no longer cool with Aubrey.\n\nThese two have not exactly been friendly since Kendrick Lamar dropped his \"Control\" verse in 2013, which called out Drake, Big Sean, Wale and several other hip-hop heavyweights. While it doesn't appear that they were close, their beef didn't come to the forefront until Lamar decided to address J. Cole's \"Big 3\" comment. Drake and Lamar have now embarked on a weeks-long back and forth, exchanging prompt diss tracks.\n\nThis beef seemingly came out of nowhere. However, with Gunna planning to release his album on May 10th, Future appeared to take shots at his plans. After he dissed someone's forthcoming project, which many perceived to be Gunna's, the latter fired back with a subtweet.\n\nTheir feud arose when Sukihana asked JT to clear up a line in her \"Okay\" track, which spoke about someone having \"cheap a** veneers.\" Suki took this as a dig at her, who publicly lost one of her veneers while eating crab legs. When JT refused to address Suki, an internet beef ensued.\n\nOne of the saddest beefs to hit rap was that of Yung Miami and JT. After months of dodging rumors that they were no longer friends, the pair aired out their issues online. JT believed that Miami never defended her against social media dragging, while Miami felt the same way. While things appear to have calmed down between the duo, clearly there are some issues lingering between them.\n\nThese two had issues since the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards after it was rumored that GloRilla slapped JT. The Florida rapper denied it happened, while Glo maintained she indeed hit JT with her purse. After Glo released \"Yeah Glo\" in February, JT appeared to believe that the line \"Slappin' rap b****es and makin' bail, h**\" was about the alleged assault. When Glo didn't clear up the meaning of the bars, it was up from there.\n\nIt's also unclear where J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar went wrong. However, Cole has continued to acknowledge Lamar as one of the greats, which is why he included him in his \"Big 3,\" which consisted of Cole, Drake and Lamar. After the Cali rapper distanced himself from the \"Big 3\" on \"Like That,\" Cole dropped a response track, \"7 Minute Drill,\" though he quickly deleted it and apologized.\n\nTheir beef dates back to the early 2000s when Benzino and The Source leaked a story about Eminem using the N-word.

Maybe I do. But when you die, will people notice?\" Jeff Daniels, the lead actor in the Netflix series A Man In Full says while lying down on the ground. \"When I go, there are gonna be a lot of memories of me by a lot of people, many who hate me. Even so, a person needs to live with vigor. Otherwise, what's the point?\" Drizzy shared this clip early Thursday morning (May 9).\n\nIt is unclear what he is looking to convey here. Is this him bowing out of the battle, like many people thought when he released \"The Heart Part 6\" on Sunday evening (May 5)? Is this him justifying the depths that he went in the battle, such as suggesting that Dave Free is the actual father of K. Dot's children with his fianc\u00e9e Whitney Alford and that the Compton, Calif., rapper domestically abused her? Time will tell what the Toronto superstar decides to do next.\n\nIn the court of public opinion, many people believe that Drake lost the battle with Kendrick Lamar; perhaps the Instagram post was a response to that. \"Drake lost the moment Kendrick prayed about this sh*t on 6:16 IN LA ni**a said, 'God my confession is yours but who am i if i don't go to war?' like he's a f**king holy knight or something,\" one fan wrote.\n\nSome fans are saying K. Dot's Saturday evening (May 4) release \"Not Like Us\" is what decided the battle, especially given its commercial success. \"Drake lost a record he held since 2017 to a song that calls him a 'certified pedophile,'\" another fan wrote. This referred to \"Not Like Us\" breaking the all-time record for biggest single-day streams of a Hip-Hop song in US Spotify history, though the fan incorrectly cited the length of the record. The previous holder, Drake's \"Girls Want Girls\" featuring Lil Baby, was released in 2021.\n\nAnother aspect of why people are handing the \"Rich Baby Daddy\" rapper the loss is the growing popularity of Metro Boomin's \"BBL Drizzy\" beat. Several rappers have tried their hand at rapping over it, but other fans have morphed the beat to fit into other genres such as merengue.\n\nDrake and Kendrick Lamar's battle hit a peak last week. First, K. Dot released \"Euphoria\" on Tuesday afternoon (April 30) before following up with \"6:16 In LA\" on Friday morning (May 3). The part-time crooner fired back with \"Family Matters\" and a parody of Lamar's verse on the \"Buried Alive Interlude\" via Instagram later that evening.\n\nHowever, the Pulitzer Prize winner immediately halted any momentum those records would gain by releasing \"Meet The Grahams\" almost a half hour later. He doubled down with \"Not Like Us\" on Saturday evening, and the Degrassi actor sent out the latest shot with \"The Heart Part 6\" on Sunday evening.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armon_sadler@vibe.com", "name": "Armon Sadler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digi+Phonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digi+Phonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_Want_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girls Want Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Baby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lil Baby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Daddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baby Daddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merengue_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merengue music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350349645-3-e1715269897519.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 408}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 579, "textEnd": 584}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1290, "textEnd": 1295}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2173, "textEnd": 2181}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2240, "textEnd": 2245}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

While no proof has been offered as to whether, as alleged in these recent tracks, Kendrick abused his partner or that Drake is a pedophile, the question remains: did this feud have to get this nasty?\n\nToday on Commotion, host Elamin Abdelmahmoud talks to rap culture critics Clarkisha Kent and Charles Holmes about the latest developments in the rap feud, and the way misogyny has been used not only within this feud but across rap music history.\n\nWe've included some highlights below, edited for length and clarity. For the full discussion, listen and follow the Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud podcast, on your favourite podcast player.\n\nElamin: Clarkisha, did you expect this feud to get this nasty from the start?\n\nClarkisha: What do you need to know is Kendrick is a Gemini. So just to give you some context on what that means: we have Donald Trump, we have Kanye West, and we have Azealia Banks.\n\nElamin: Wow. You're like, they're a specific kind of messy. But this has lasted a long time, Clarkisha. Did you expect it would keep going this many weeks?\n\nClarkisha: Yes. Kendrick strikes me as very petty. I don't say that as an insult, but I feel like he's giving, \"If you go low, I'm going to the bottom.\"\n\nElamin: Charles, what about you? Were you anticipating this level of nastiness?\n\nCharles: Not originally, because these two men are way too wealthy to debase themselves in this way for what seems to be a beef about truly nothing, when you boil it down. But I think historically speaking, once a rapper goes to, \"I'm bringing your family into this. I'm bringing wives and baby mothers,\" I was like, this is going nuclear. And that happened very fast.\n\nElamin: Clarkisha, the type of accusations that Kendrick and Drake have been making towards each other have been making so many people uncomfortable. What, to you, is the most alarming accusation that Kendrick made of Drake?\n\nClarkisha: Definitely the pedophile mention. On the song [Not Like Us], he was talking about mansion parties and funneling people -- very dark considering, for example, what's happening with Diddy right now. So I was like, whoa.\n\nElamin: That's a serious accusation, also a very ugly one, that is kind of presented again without proof. Charles, what for you has been the most troubling thing that Drake has said about Kendrick?\n\nCharles: I think the most troubling accusation that he has doubled down -- honestly tripled down on, at this point -- is that he alleges Kendrick has a history of assaulting women, and I think assaulting specifically his partner. He has gone on and on about basically Kendrick having to hire a crisis PR firm to cover up this alleged assault. And then he took it one step further, alleging that one of Kendrick's children with his partner is the child of his business partner, Dave Free. So that's how ugly that side of the beef has gone.\n\nElamin: I will say that, again, all of these accusations? Literally no proof. No one on either side is willing to present any particular shred of evidence for the thing that they're alleging.\n\nCharles: No fact-checking here. There are no fact-checking departments in rap beef, unfortunately.\n\nElamin: It turns out you can just say anything that you want to say. Clarkisha, you've noted this hypocrisy that is kind of in this feud, right? Particularly because of how it implicates the women in both Drake and Kendrick's lives. Can you just talk a little bit about that?\n\nClarkisha: Yeah, I was side-eyeing both of them. With Kendrick, he's worked with Dr. Dre before, who we know beat up Dee Barnes, which is very upsetting -- she's a hip-hop journalist, she was doing her job. Kendrick has also worked with Kodak Black, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge [of first degree assault and battery in a 2016 sexual assault case]. And like Meg, Rihanna, Serena...\n\nElamin: With Megan Thee Stallion, Tory Lanez was recently convicted of shooting Megan Thee Stallion. In that conversation, Drake had kind of sided with Tory Lanez, and so it just felt a little bit rich, this particular thing that Drake is saying about Kendrick coming out of Drake, of all people.\n\nCharles, there is this long history of -- how do I put this? -- of rappers using women in beef, particularly as ornaments or as props in the conversation. Can you give us some of the most prominent examples of how this has come up before?\n\nCharles: I think the two ones that stick out to me, the first is just one of the most famous opening lines in hip-hop. It comes from Hit 'Em Up by Tupac. Tupac alleges that he slept with Faith [Evans], who had a long relationship with The Notorious B.I.G. There's Super Ugly, where essentially Jay-Z is -- I honestly can't say the stuff that he was alleging that he did with one of the baby mothers of Nas. It's legendary at this point. His mom called Jay up and was like, \"You need to apologize.

The conversation was focused on the fact the Toronto superstar used modulated vocals, popularly mislabeled AI, on \"Taylor Made Freestyle\". This battle elevated to a more intense, dark level in just six days.\n\nUnderstandably, many fans are a bit exhausted. The records have been high quality and entertaining, but the barrage of songs over this past weekend made it difficult to fully digest everything the Hip-Hop community had received before having to move on to the next one. This entire experience is the perfect example of \"Be careful what you wish for,\" as this is a beef that fans have wanted for over a decade. Sometimes, there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nThis beef has also uncovered an often dismissed reality: there is no closure in music. More specifically, there is no way to determine who wins a rap beef other than a myriad of opinions. Fanbases have picked their sides, some before even hearing a single song, and waged war over the internet. The fighting between fans has contributed to the aforementioned feeling of exhaustion, but there is no impartial judge here to decide the true victor and provide a reprieve.\n\nSo, with that, here comes another opinion: which diss song is the best here? However, even that question opens the door for more questions, because what goes into having the best song? Is it the lyrical content? How about the listenability and replay value? Is it the release strategy, timeliness, and marketing? All of those things matter, but fans all prioritize different aspects of this multi-layered, overwhelming heavyweight bout.\n\nAlas, here we go; read below as VIBE ranks the best diss songs of Kendrick Lamar and Drake's beef so far. Note that the J. Cole-assisted \"First Person Shooter\" will not be included given the fact the masses weren't aware that it was a diss toward Kendrick Lamar, and the song was released almost seven months ago. \"7 Minute Drill\" will also not be included since the Dreamville rapper unceremoniously removed himself from the chaos, and deleted the song from streaming platforms, though that may have been wise given where this entire situation has gone.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armon_sadler@vibe.com", "name": "Armon Sadler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamville_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dreamville Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vibe (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drill music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-06T125058.210.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551087", "eventUri": "eng-9551087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

While they were perhaps at their most clearly defined during the West Coast and East Coast battles of the 90s, they haven't gone anywhere. The rise of southern rap later that decade set in motion a series of dominoes that led to contemporary trap styles. And the internet has allowed even more regional sounds to become identifiable to rap fans. And Ebro recently found himself in hot water when he weighed in on Toronto's alleged lack of a regional sound while talking about the Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef.\n\nDuring a radio discussion about the beef he took some time to shift the focus a bit. He made comments about both Drake and the city he comes from not having a definitive regional sound. As you'd expect, that was met with very mixed reactions by fans. In the comments, they continue the debate. \"Drake do have a sound though , it's young money they forgot that\" one fan suggests. \"Drake is a rapper from TORONTO and nobody was checking for Toronto for rap until Drake showed up. So how is Drake supposed to have a regional identity in a place that no one was checking for rap music?\" another fan suggests. Check out Ebro's full comments and the fan debates below.\n\nDrake currently appears to be licking his wounds following a hostile beef with Kendrick Lamar. The two went back and forth for weeks resulting in some deeply personal disses. At the end of his most recent track \"The Heart Part 6\" Drake claims that he's done with the beef. It's yet to be seen if Kendrick has any response to the accusation that rumors he spread about Drake having a secret child were actually planted by Drake's team.\n\nWhat do you think of Ebro's comments about Drake and Toronto lacking a definitive rap style?

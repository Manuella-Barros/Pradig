His personal information doesn't necessarily add up either, with Buckeyes records showing he pulled his only career start in 2022 against Michigan on the defensive line -- when he was always with the offense.\n\nVimahi should have plenty of opportunity to rectify these issues when he joins the University of Washington football team as an offensive guard for fall camp, after announcing on Monday he has committed to the Huskies from the transfer portal.\n\nWhile the UW is in serious need of veteran offensive line help these days -- and it just lost former Old Dominion offensive tackle Chris Adams on a commitment flip to Memphis -- the 6-foot-4, 310-pound Vimahi is looking for a fresh start after having his career stall out some at Ohio State.\n\nWhile he appeared in 37 games over five seasons, he still didn't play that much for the Big Ten team, hence the lack of photographic proof from the wire services. Ohio State records show he appeared in all 13 outings in 2022, but his season-high snaps topped out at just 23 each against Toledo and Michigan State.\n\nA native of Kahuku, Hawaii, Vimahi arrived at Ohio State with much loftier goals. He was one of the nation's top 2019 recruits, considered the 132nd player in the country, the No. 8 offensive guard nationally and the No. 2 player coming out of the islands. He picked Ohio State from among 27 offers that included Oklahoma, Notre Dame, USC and even the Huskies, who recruited him back then with then-defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe, who had the Hawaii territory, and former offensive line coach Scott Huff.\n\nNow a sixth-year senior, Vimahi appeared in 3, 6, 8, 13 and 7 games over his career for the Buckeyes, starting just that one time in a 45-23 defeat to Michigan in Columbus two years ago when he appeared in every outing on the schedule.\n\nThis past season had to be particularly frustrating for him as he sat out three of the first four games, played in three consecutive, sat out another, played in three more and didn't get on the field against Michigan or Missouri in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nHe's needed in Montlake, where the Huskies lost all five starters to the NFL as draftees or to the SEC as transfers and have an exceedingly young corps of O-linemen. For spring practice, the UW often used true freshmen Paki Finau and Michael Watkins as the starting guards.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors":

Go Dawgs!!\"\n\nHe is a graduate transfer who will have one year of eligibility remaining. Vimahi played 100 total offensive line snaps last season -- and then 10 on special teams. He did get to start in the Cotton Bowl loss to Missouri, playing 57 snaps.\n\nAlthough he is a sixth-year senior and started against Mizzou, he was not expected to contribute for the Buckeyes starting offensive line this season. Below, you can see what Ohio State's actual projected starting lineup looks like up front, courtesy of Letterman Row's Spencer Holbrook.\n\nProjected starters: LT Josh Simmons, LG Donovan Jackson, C Seth McLaughlin, RG Tegra Tshabola, RT Josh Fryar\n\nLast year was a transition year for the Ohio State offensive line after losing three starters from the stellar 2022 line to the NFL. The tackles were average -- at their best -- and the interior became leaky as the season went on. It must be better. Left tackle Josh Simmons quietly developed into the Buckeyes best offensive lineman last season, especially into October and November. He and Donovan Jackson have the left side of the line locked down already, and the Buckeyes keep praising Alabama transfer and former Crimson Tide starting center Seth McLaughlin.\n\nThe question is on the right side, but there seems to be progress there following the spring. And the spring game was certainly telling. Josh Fryar has been impressive in spring in trying to retain his starting role at tackle. Sophomore Luke Montgomery looked good at right guard early, but it was actually last year's starting center, Carson Hinzman, and Tegra Tshabola who took first-team reps at right guard in the spring game. Ohio State has been toying with other options at right guard, but with what we know right now, Tshabola is Lettermen Row's the pick to start as of early May.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weber@on3.com", "name": "Alex Weber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/Exhibitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/Exhibitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/01/30183417/Helmet-Washington.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544114", "eventUri": "eng-9544114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

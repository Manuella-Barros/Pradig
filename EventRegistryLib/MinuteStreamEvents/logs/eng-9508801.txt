THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank GunnTORONTO - Brad Marchand had a relatively quiet - at least by his in-your-face standards - start to the Stanley Cup playoffs. Sure, the Bruins captain drew some key penalties and picked up three assists through six periods against the Maple Leafs. He'd also yet to truly leave his mark. And it felt like only a matter of time before one of the NHL's best both with the puck on his stick, and at hockey's dark arts when it isn't, properly entered the fray. The moment arrived Wednesday. Marchand scored twice, including the winner, in a three-point performance as Boston picked up a 4-2 victory to grab a 2-1 lead in this first-round series on a night where the home side was left frustrated by a player who's spent a lot of his career doing exactly that. \"The gamesmanship and everything, it's world class,\" Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said. \"He's been in the league long enough \"| he gets calls. \"It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We've got to play through that.\" Marchand got tangled up with Tyler Bertuzzi in the second period with Toronto up 1-0. A frothing Scotiabank Arena crowd clamouring for a penalty, the referees took no issues before Trent Frederic scored the tying goal seconds later. \"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does,\" Keefe continued. \"It's an art and he's elite at it. \"We have to manage our way through that.\" Jake DeBrusk had the other goal for Boston. The Bruins got 28 stops from Jeremy Swayman, who made 35 saves in his team's 5-1 victory in Game 1 before giving way to crease counterpart Linus Ullmark in the Leafs' 3-2 triumph two nights later. \"We stuck with it all game,\" Marchand said. \"We elevated to another level.\" Bertuzzi and Matthew Knies replied for Toronto. Ilya Samsonov made 30 saves. Leafs winger William Nylander missed a third straight contest with an undisclosed injury. Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup goes Saturday. Game 5 is set for Tuesday in Boston. Moments after Toronto tied things 2-2 in the third, and then nearly grabbed the lead off a Swayman turnover, Marchand took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past Samsonov's ear at 11:53. Toronto pulled its goaltender for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go, but Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 64 seconds left and Marchand sealed it into the empty net. \"He obviously wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" Knies said. \"We've just got to be composed and not get into that bulls -- .\" Tied 1-1 through 40 minutes, DeBrusk bagged his third goal in as many games when he scored on a man advantage 67 seconds after the restart off a Marchand rebound when the Leafs lost structure on their struggling penalty kill. Toronto's power play came over the boards a few minutes later, but couldn't connect despite a couple of great chances for Bertuzzi, slipping to 0-for-5 on the night and 1-for-11 in the series. Bruins winger James van Riemsdyk hit the post on a partial break midway through the period before Bertuzzi tipped a Morgan Rielly shot off Boston defenceman Hampus Lindholm to tie the game 2-2. Marchand - seemingly always in the thick of things at this time of year - responded just 28 seconds later to give his team a lead it would never surrender to re-establish home-ice advantage. The Leafs opened the scoring at 13:10 of the second when the under-fire Mitch Marner - without a point through two games and the subject of intense media scrutiny - slid a pass for Knies to redirect. Samsonov stopped van Riemsdyk on another partial break, but the Bruins tied it at 17:37 when Frederic fired his second of the series in off the post. The play unfolded as Marchand and Bertuzzi - teammates last season in Boston - got tangled up in the neutral zone, and moments after Leafs star Auston Matthews was tackled by Charlie McAvoy. \"Bert and I get tied up one shift,\" Marchand said in trying to downplay the narrative. \"But outside of that I'm not really in the mix with anything. I'm just trying to play.\" \"It's what he does,\" Bertuzzi said. \"He's been doing it for a long time. I don't expect it to stop.\" The Leafs will now look to regroup after playing their first home game since April 13 - or face the tall task of winning three straight against an opponent that has won eight of the last nine meetings between the teams. \"At times we played well,\" Keefe said. \"Not well enough to get the win.\" Part of the equation was how the Leafs handled Marchand. ON SCHEDULE Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about a playoff schedule that sees two days off on either side of Game 4. \"I would have rather been here Thursday/Saturday, if I'm being honest,\" he said. \"I think we're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto's spending in Boston. \"And we're the home team.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 24, 2024.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank GunnTORONTO - Brad Marchand scored twice, including the winner in the third period, and added an assist as the Boston Bruins downed the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 to take a 2-1 lead in their first-round playoff series Wednesday. Jake DeBrusk and Trent Frederic had the other goals for Boston. The Bruins got 28 stops from Jeremy Swayman, who made 35 saves in his team's 5-1 victory in Game 1 before giving way to crease counterpart Linus Ullmark in the Leafs' 3-2 triumph two nights later. Tyler Bertuzzi and Matthew Knies replied for Toronto. Ilya Samsonov made 30 saves. Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup goes Saturday back at Scotiabank Arena. Game 5 is set for Tuesday in Boston. Leafs winger William Nylander took line rushes at the morning skate, but missed a third straight contest - the Swede played all 82 in the regular season - with an undisclosed injury. Moments after the Leafs tied things 2-2 to send Scotiabank Arena into a frenzy and then nearly took the lead off a Swayman turnover, Marchard took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past Samsonov's ear at 11:53 of the third. Toronto pulled Samsonov for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go in regulation, but Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 64 seconds left before Marchand sealed it into the empty net. Tied 1-1 through 40 minutes, DeBrusk bagged his third goal in as many games when he scored on a man advantage 67 seconds after the restart off a Marchand rebound when the Leafs lost structure on their struggling penalty kill. Toronto's power play came over the boards a few minutes later, but couldn't connect despite a couple of great chances for Bertuzzi, slipping to 0-for-5 on the night and 1-for-11 in the series. Bruins winger James van Riemsdyk hit the post on a partial break midway through the period before Bertuzzi tipped a Morgan Rielly shot off Boston defenceman Hampus Lindholm to tie the game 2-2. Marchand - Boston's captain seemingly always in the thick of things at this time of year - responded just 28 seconds later to give his team a lead it would never surrender to re-establish home-ice advantage. The Leafs opened the scoring at 13:10 of the second when the under-fire Mitch Marner - without a point through two games and the subject of intense media scrutiny - deftly moved past a defender and slid a pass for Knies to redirect upstairs on Swayman. Samsonov stopped van Riemsdyk on a partial breakaway moments later, but the Bruins tied it at 17:37 when Frederic fired his second goal of the series in off the post on a shot the netminder will want back. The play unfolded as Marchand and Bertuzzi got tangled up in the neutral zone, and moments after, Leafs star Auston Matthews was tackled behind Boston's net by Charlie McAvoy. Toronto, which fell to Boston in seven games to open the 2013, 2018 and 2019 playoffs, was buzzing around the offensive zone on an early power play before the Bruins had the best chance on a short-handed Pavel Zacha breakaway that Samsonov turned aside. Toronto defenceman Joel Edmundson made a crucial block with his goaltender out of position later in the first period on a David Pastrnak opportunity. The Leafs had another fruitless power play before Tavares ripped a shot off the crossbar. Toronto winger Max Domi then created a turnover behind the Boston net and nearly capitalized, but Swayman was there. The home side brought some physicality as the period wound down, with Simon Benoit, David Kampf and Ryan Reaves throwing their weight around to raucous approval. Matthews hit the post early in the second and had another chance on a Marner power-play setup. Samsonov then denied Pat Maroon at the other end before the teams finally broke through. FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS Van Riemsdyk, who was a healthy scratch for the first two games, suited up in a building he called home for six seasons with the Leafs from 2012-13 through 2017-18. SCHEDULE TALK Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about a playoff schedule that sees two days off on either side of Game 4. \"I would have rather been here Thursday/Saturday, if I'm being honest,\" he said. \"I think we're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto's spending in Boston. \"And we're the home team.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 24, 2024.

He now trails Doug Gilmour (60) and Darryl Sittler (40).\n\nBoston tied it in the second period when Trent Frederic scooped up a loose puck while the Leafs' Tyler Bertuzzi and the Bruins' Brad Marchand were tangled up on the blue line. This may have caused just a slight delay on the part of the Leafs defenders, allowing Frederic to wrist a shot past Leafs goaltender Ilya Samsinov.\n\nThe Maple Leafs tied the game when a Morgan Reilly shot bounced off Bertuzzi's skateblade and into the net. The Bruins quickly regained the lead 18 seconds later when Marchand snuck behind the Leafs' defense and tipped a pass past Samsinov. Marchand, who has four assists, picked up his first goal of the series.\n\nRelated: 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 1 Hub\n\nThe Leafs pulled their goaltender with just under two minutes left in the game, but John Tavares tackled Charlie McAvoy behind the Bruins' net and was whistled for holding.

The series is tied at 1-1. The games is at 7 p.m. ET and will be aired on ESPN, SN, CBC, TVAS and NESN.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have the upper hand from their last game, winning 3-2. This game marks the fourth occasion since 2013 that Game 3 will be played in Toronto between the two teams.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have won their last two Game 3s against the Bruins, restricting them to two goals per game. Auston Matthews has found the net in both of these Game 3s.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins: Game Preview\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs have a 12-12-3 record against the Atlantic Division and an overall record of 46-26-10, have scored 298 goals in total, averaging 3.6 per game, which places them second in the league. At home this season, they finished with a 22-15-4 record overall.\n\nThe Leafs displayed a stronger performance in their second game, particularly on the defensive end, thanks to their star player Auston Matthews.\n\nMatthews, who not only assisted two goals and made eight shots on goal, also scored the decisive goal in third period, leading the Leafs to a 3-2 victory and breaking their eight-game losing streak against the Bruins.\n\nDespite a shaky start, where it seemed like the Leafs were going to fall behind 2-1 at the end of the first period, they managed a goal in both the second and third periods, which led to their victory.\n\nThe Leafs made 33 shots on goal, with Max Domi, Auston Matthews and John Tavares each scoring a goal. Goalie Ilya Samsonov made 27 saves, with a save percentage of .931.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boston Bruins has an overall record of 47-20-15 and a 19-6-3 record against the Atlantic Division and have had a solid season on the road, ending with a 23-9-9 record.\n\nIn their last game, the Bruins led 1-0 and 2-1, but the Leafs tied the game in the second period. Jake DeBrusk played exceptionally well, scoring two goals and providing two assists.\n\nThe Bruins made 29 attempts on goal, with Morgan Geekie and David Pastrnak scoring, Despite Jeremy Swayman's impressive performance in game one, the Bruins decided to go with Linus Ullmark as their goalie. Ullmark performed well, saving 27 of 30 shots, but it wasn't enough to pull off a win.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins: Injury report\n\nThe Bruins will be without Justin Brazeau due to an upper-body injury, Milan Lucic for personal seasons and Matthew Poitras because of a shoulder injury.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toronto's Bobby McCann is dealing with a lower-body injury and is listed as day-to-day. John Klingberg and Jake Muzzin are sidelined with hip and back injuries respectively.\n\nMatt Murray is also out with a hip injury, while key player William Nylander is day-to-day due to an undisclosed condition.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins: Head-to-head and significant numbers\n\nThe Bruins and the Maple Leafs have clashed 85 times in playoff games.

We've got to play through that.\"\n\nMarchand got tangled up with Tyler Bertuzzi in the second period with Toronto up 1-0. A frothing Scotiabank Arena crowd clamouring for a penalty, the referees took no issues before Trent Frederic scored the tying goal seconds later.\n\n\"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does,\" Keefe continued. \"It's an art and he's elite at it.\n\n\"We have to manage our way through that.\"\n\nJake DeBrusk had the other goal for Boston. The Bruins got 28 stops from Jeremy Swayman, who made 35 saves in his team's 5-1 victory in Game 1 before giving way to crease counterpart Linus Ullmark in the Leafs' 3-2 triumph two nights later.\n\n\"We stuck with it all game,\" Marchand said. \"We elevated to another level.\"\n\nBertuzzi and Matthew Knies replied for Toronto. Ilya Samsonov made 30 saves. Leafs winger William Nylander missed a third straight contest with an undisclosed injury.\n\nGame 4 of the best-of-seven matchup goes Saturday. Game 5 is set for Tuesday in Boston.\n\nMoments after Toronto tied things 2-2 in the third, and then nearly grabbed the lead off a Swayman turnover, Marchand took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past Samsonov's ear at 11:53.\n\nToronto pulled its goaltender for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go, but Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 64 seconds left and Marchand sealed it into the empty net.\n\n\"He obviously wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" Knies said. \"We've just got to be composed and not get into that bulls---.\"\n\nTied 1-1 through 40 minutes, DeBrusk bagged his third goal in as many games when he scored on a man advantage 67 seconds after the restart off a Marchand rebound when the Leafs lost structure on their struggling penalty kill.\n\nToronto's power play came over the boards a few minutes later, but couldn't connect despite a couple of great chances for Bertuzzi, slipping to 0-for-5 on the night and 1-for-11 in the series.\n\nBruins winger James van Riemsdyk hit the post on a partial break midway through the period before Bertuzzi tipped a Morgan Rielly shot off Boston defenceman Hampus Lindholm to tie the game 2-2.\n\nMarchand -- seemingly always in the thick of things at this time of year -- responded just 28 seconds later to give his team a lead it would never surrender to re-establish home-ice advantage.\n\nThe Leafs opened the scoring at 13:10 of the second when the under-fire Mitch Marner -- without a point through two games and the subject of intense media scrutiny -- slid a pass for Knies to redirect.\n\nSamsonov stopped van Riemsdyk on another partial break, but the Bruins tied it at 17:37 when Frederic fired his second of the series in off the post.\n\nThe play unfolded as Marchand and Bertuzzi -- teammates last season in Boston -- got tangled up in the neutral zone, and moments after Leafs star Auston Matthews was tackled by Charlie McAvoy.\n\n\"Bert and I get tied up one shift,\" Marchand said in trying to downplay the narrative. \"But outside of that I'm not really in the mix with anything. I'm just trying to play.\"\n\n\"It's what he does,\" Bertuzzi said. \"He's been doing it for a long time. I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nThe Leafs will now look to regroup after playing their first home game since April 13 -- or face the tall task of winning three straight against an opponent that has won eight of the last nine meetings between the teams.\n\n\"At times we played well,\" Keefe said. \"Not well enough to get the win.\"\n\nPart of the equation was how the Leafs handled Marchand.\n\nON SCHEDULE\n\nBruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about a playoff schedule that sees two days off on either side of Game 4.\n\n\"I would have rather been here Thursday/Saturday, if I'm being

Boston now has a 2-1 series lead.\n\nJeremy Swayman stood on his head, especially late in the game, with 28 saves on 30 shots. The Maple Leafs went 0-for-5 on the power play, while Boston went 2-for-3.\n\nThe Bruins came to play Wednesday night and went on the power play 40 seconds in. Despite taking three shots, they were unable to capitalize on the opportunity. They survived an injury scare to Parker Wotherspoon, who was in visible pain after blocking a shot.\n\nToronto got its first man-advantage of the night four minutes after puck drop and took two shots. But, like Boston, couldn't find the back of the net.\n\nThe Bruins' best scoring chance came on a Pavel Zacha shorthanded breakaway, but Ilya Samsonov made a huge save on the forward to keep the game scoreless.\n\nThe Maple Leafs started throwing their weight around in the final two minutes of the period, but the teams remained tied at the end of the first 20 minutes.\n\nThe second period featured more intensity and pace began to escalate about halfway through. Max Domi appeared to intentionally skate into Swayman, which left Pat Maroon less than pleased. The officials separated them before it went further.\n\nThe Maple Leafs found themselves on another power play when David Pastrnak was sent to the box for hooking, but the officials missed their second high-sticking call of the night on Boston.\n\nThe Bruins killed the penalty, but the Maple Leafs broke the scoreless tie when Knies opened the scoring after he redirected a nice feed to the far post from Mitch Marner past Swayman to take a 1-0 lead with 6:50 left in the second.\n\nBut Boston took advantage of the Maple Leafs being occupied with Marchand and Tyler Bertuzzi getting tied up with one another when Trent Frederic beat Samsonov with 2:23 remaining in the period.\n\nBoth teams were assessed a penalty in the final minutes, with Charlie McAvoy being called for roughing with 1:22 left, and Bertuzzi going off for the same infraction with 16 seconds remaining.\n\nIt took just 1:07 into the third for the Bruins to take their first lead of the night when DeBrusk buried a Marchand rebound to make it 2-1.\n\nChaos ensued in front of Swayman on the next Toronto power play, but the puck somehow stayed out of the net to keep Boston's lead in tact. But Bertuzzi scored the equalizer with eight-and-a-half minutes to go.\n\nBoston wouldn't go away, though, and responded 28 seconds later with a vintage Marchand snipe to give the Bruins a 3-2 lead. Danton Heinen stayed with the puck along the boards, slowed the play down and passed it to the captain for the go-ahead goal.\n\nToronto pulled its goalie in the final two minutes, but a holding call on John Tavares put the Maple Leafs' captain in the box with 1:04 left in the game left Toronto shorthanded. Marchand potted the empty-netter to put the game away, and to take a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Saturday night with Game 4 set for 8 p.m. EST.

He took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past goalie Ilya Samsonov's ear. Marchand capped the scoring with an empty-netter and also had an assist.\n\n\"We stuck with it all game,\" Marchand said. \"We elevated to another level.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs were livid at Marchand's agitating antics.\n\n\"The gamesmanship and everything, it's world class,\" Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said about Marchand. \"He's been in the league long enough ... he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We've got to play through that.\"\n\nMarchand got tangled up with Bertuzzi in the second period with Toronto up 1-0. A frothing Scotiabank Arena crowd clamoring for a penalty, the referees took no issues before Trent Frederic scored the tying goal seconds later.\n\n\"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does,\" Keefe said. \"It's an art and he's elite at it. We have to manage our way through that.\"\n\nJake DeBrusk also scored for Boston, and Jeremy Swayman made 28 saves. Swayman made 35 saves in Boston's 5-1 victory in Game 1, then gave way to Linus Ullmark in Toronto's 3-2 victory in Game 2.\n\nMatthew Knies also scored for Toronto, and Samsonov made 30 saves. Toronto was 0 for 5 on the power play, leaving it 1 for 11 in the series.\n\n\"At times we played well,\" Keefe said. \"Not well enough to get the win.\"\n\nGame 4 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday night at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nToronto pulled Samsonov for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go, but Maple Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 1:04 left and Marchand sealed it with the empty-net goal.\n\nThe Maple Leafs opened the scoring with 6:50 left in the second. Mitch Marner deftly moved past a defender and slid a pass for Knies to redirect upstairs on Swayman.\n\nBoston tied it with 2:23 left in the period when Frederic's shot went off the lost and in.

But once the Bruins earned a 2-1 lead, they did Bruins things and nullified nearly every opportunity the Leafs had through the neutral zone, taking a once-vociferous crowd out of the game.\n\nWithout William Nylander for the third playoff game in a row, the Leafs looked more and more like a team hurting for offence. They were outshot by the Bruins 34-30 and now find themselves without the momentum in the series they once enjoyed.\n\nThe Leafs allowed a power-play goal for the third game in a row. As it stands, the team's lack of proper penalty-killing personnel is now at risk of sinking them in the series. The Bruins had just two power plays and Jake DeBrusk capitalized once again with his third power-play goal of the series. Down a man, the Leafs haven't done a good enough job cutting off passing lanes and have allowed the Bruins too easy a path toward their goal. Ilya Samsonov gave up a tasty rebound on DeBrusk's goal but how he was allowed to corral that rebound without any resistance from the Leafs is something that will have to be reviewed by the Leafs.\n\nAnd on the other end: How a highly-potent Leafs offence could get five (!) power plays and not bury a single goal is a testament as much to the Bruins' ability to swarm the Leafs as it is the Leafs own hesitance to shoot the puck and hope for chaos. The Leafs continually looked too tentative with the man advantage and now find themselves with just one power-play goal in the series after 11 opportunities.\n\nBrad Marchand is quickly becoming the most-hated man in Toronto by doing exactly what he had to do in Game 3.\n\nFirst, he sneakily tied up Tyler Bertuzzi and took him out of the play as the Bruins stormed toward the Leafs' goal. Could Marchand have been called for a tripping penalty on Bertuzzi? Possibly, but Marchand is still a master of the dark arts and knows how to influence the game with his pesky play. The Leafs felt distracted and stood frozen as Trent Frederic fired an easy shot past Ilya Samsonov for the game-tying goal.\n\n\"You just have to be smart,\" Keefe said before the game of Marchand's ability to draw penalties. \"You have to recognize the moment and the player or players you are playing against.\"\n\nMarchand continued to get in the face and then under the skin of multiple Leafs as the game wore on.\n\nBut late in the third period, Marchand showed the different elements of his game and why he's a future Hall of Famer. With too much time and space on his hands, he wired a nasty shot past Samsonov to take the lead. And as he skated toward an empty Leafs goal with less than a minute remaining, he could have done the cheeky thing and wired a shot home for a goal. But he simply pushed the puck into the empty net because that was all he needed to do. He was one of the difference-makers, but the Leafs inability to shut him down also needs to be questioned.\n\nDid Samsonov play one of his better games as a Leaf in Game 2? Yes.\n\nDid he allow one, arguably two goals in Game 3 that in part let the game get away from the Leafs? You could also, confidently, say yes as well.\n\nSamsonov simply has to make a save on the Bruins' first goal. Trent Frederic's shot wasn't all that powerful or doused with that much mustard, but it still found its way under Samsonov.\n\nA save on either the second or third goal would have gone a long way too. The consistency in Samsonov's game has long been lacking this season, even though he's still the unquestioned No. 1 in Toronto. The Leafs will need Samsonov to steal a game for them this series to get by the Bruins, just as Jeremy Swayman did for Boston in Game 1. Game 3 wasn't that kind of game from Samsonov, and was far from his best.\n\nHeading into Game 3, the concerns about Mitch Marner and his poor production in this series (he didn't have a single point after scoring 85 points in 69 regular season games) had very quickly become a talking point.\n\n\"It's just about doing the same thing you've done all year,\" Marner said of the increased attention that comes his way during the playoffs. \"Just trusting your team and yourself.\"\n\nWhen it mattered, with Game 3 knotted in a scoreless draw midway through the second period, Marner worked his magic on the ice in a way few NHL players can.\n\nStaring down two Bruins, Marner deftly pulled the puck away from the play to buy his winger, Matthew Knies, some time to get to the net. He then utilized his high hockey IQ to send a pass through three different players and right onto the tape of Knies' stick.\n\nIt was Marner's 48th playoff point, the most of any Leaf since 1994.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_kloke@theathletic.com", "name": "Joshua Kloke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/24214806/USATSI_23105392.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

We've got to play through that.\"\n\nMarchand got tangled up with Tyler Bertuzzi in the second period with Toronto up 1-0.

I'm just trying to play.\"\n\n\"It's what he does,\" Bertuzzi said. \"He's been doing it for a long time. I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nThe Leafs will now look to regroup after playing their first home game since April 13 -- or face the tall task of winning three straight against an opponent that has won nine of the last 10 meetings between the teams.\n\n\"At times we played well,\" Keefe said. \"Not well enough to get the win.\"\n\nPart of the equation was how the Leafs handled Marchand.\n\nON

They equalized just 3:01 after Matthew Knies opened the scoring in the second period. When Tyler Bertuzzi tied the game at two in the third period, it took the B's just 28 seconds to regain the lead again on a Brad Marchand goal.\n\nMarchand also scored an empty-net goal late in the third period to seal the win, moving him into a tie with Cam Neely for first place on the team's all-time playoff goals leaderboard at 55.\n\nMarchand's play in the third period set the tone for the B's during some shaky moments. That's why he's the captain.\n\nThe series continues Saturday night with Game 4 in Toronto. Before we look ahead to that matchup, here are three takeaways from Bruins-Leafs Game 3.\n\nThe Bruins got a rough whistle in this game, but the penalty kill did its job very well.\n\nThis unit went a perfect 4-of-4, improving its mark to 10-of-11 through three games. That's a pretty good success rate against a Leafs team that had the seventh-best power play in the regular season.\n\nSwayman was arguably the Bruins' best penalty killer. He made some terrific saves while the B's were shorthanded, including a clutch stop on a wide open Auston Matthews shot from inside the left faceoff circle during a second period Leafs power play. Swayman also made three Grade A saves during a Leafs power play early in the third period, too (see video below).\n\nIn total, he made six saves while the B's were shorthanded.\n\nThe Bruins also continued to be red-hot on the power play. Jake DeBrusk scored with the man advantage early in the third period to give Boston a 2-1 lead.\n\nIt was DeBrusk's third power-play goal of the series and Boston's fourth tally with the man advantage in the series. Marchand's empty-net goal at the end of the game was technically a power-play tally as well.\n\nThe Bruins scored at an impressive 30 percent rate on the power play in four games against Toronto during the regular season. The Bruins' power play is converting at a 50 percent rate (5-of-10) in Round 1. It's become a huge weapon for the B's and arguably the primary reason why they lead in the series.\n\nThis series has been very physical and Game 3 was no exception.\n\nThe Bruins and Leafs combined for 60 hits and 20 blocked shots in the first period alone. Bruins linemates Pavel Zacha and David Pastrnak were on the receiving end of a couple huge hits on the same shift in the opening period.\n\nBrad Marchand and Tyler Bertuzzi were two of the game's most physical players and got tangled up with each other on numerous occasions.\n\nThe Bruins and Leafs made some history through 40 minutes with the amount of hits tallied:\n\nThese teams have combined for 334 hits (169 for Bruins, 165 for Leafs) and 98 blocked shots (55 for Bruins, 43 for Leafs) through three games.\n\nThe Leafs have been just as, if not more physical than the Bruins in this series. That's a pretty big change compared to the 2013, 2018 and 2019 first-round series between these teams when the Bruins were clearly the tougher team.\n\nThe Leafs just can't figure out Jeremy Swayman.\n\nThe Bruins netminder made his second start of the series in Game 3 and was Boston's best player. The Leafs didn't open the scoring until there was 6:50 left in the second period. It could have been far worse for the Bruins but Swayman kept them in it.\n\nHe made saves on 28 of 30 shots for a .933 save percentage. The Leafs, based on the quality of their scoring chances, were expected to score 3.03 goals in Game 3, per Natural Stat Trick, but they only got two pucks past Swayman.\n\nSwayman went 3-0-0 against the Leafs in the regular season and is now 2-0-0 in this series. He has a .971 save percentage and a 1.40 GAA in those seven games. He made 93 saves on 96 shots (.954 save percentage) in two starts this series.\n\nThe Bruins have alternated starts between Swayman and Linus Ullmark every game since Feb. 21. Will they keep the rotation going in Game 4? Given how well Swayman has played against the Leafs this season, and in this series especially, the smartest choice would be to go back to the University of Maine product on Saturday. And there's also an extra day of rest between Games 3 and 4, which should help Swayman.\n\nBoston has a chance to take a commanding 3-1 series lead in Game 4. You need your best goalie starting in that scenario.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(goaltender)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Save (goaltender)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Neely", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam Neely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Zacha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Zacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Maine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/04/Jeremy-Swayman-USATSI_23105449.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-21", "textStart": 4363, "textEnd": 4370}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Brian Fluharty-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs are officially tied 1-1 in their Round 1 NHL Playoff series. Game 2 goes Wednesday night in Toronto, and oddsmakers project the Leafs to deliver in front of their home fans.\n\nToronto is a slight moneyline favorite in the Game 3 Leafs vs Bruins odds as the series shifts to T.O. NHL player props favor Leafs superstar Auston Matthews to build on his impressive Game 2 performance.\n\nLet's get into the Bruins vs Leafs Game 3 odds, as we provide our prediction and player props picks.\n\nBruins vs Leafs Game 3 Odds\n\nIn the Bruins vs Leafs odds for Game 3, Toronto is a slight -112 moneyline favorite at DraftKings, giving them 52.8% implied win probability. Some sportsbooks have this game as a pick 'em (equal -110 odds).\n\nPuck drop for Bruins vs Leafs Game 3 is at 7:00 pm ET, with CBC carrying the broadcast in Canada.\n\nOdds as of April 24, 2024, at DraftKingsSportsbook. Check out the DraftKings promo code for new users to bet on Bruins vs Leafs.\n\nMatthews Shines in Game 1\n\nAfter being held off the scoresheet in the series opener, Auston Matthews made his presence felt in Game 2. The Leafs superstar scored the game-winning goal, dished out two assists, recorded eight shots, delivered six hits, and won 69.6 percent of his faceoffs (16 of 23) in a 3-2 victory.\n\nWhile Matthews is heating up, the Leafs remain without one of their other top superstars. Toronto's William Nylander has missed the first two games of this series after sustaining an undisclosed injury in the team's regular-season finale last Wednesday.\n\nThe latest William Nylander update is that the Swede participated in Toronto's morning skate Wednesday and is \"questionable\" for Game 3. However, Nylander stayed out with the scratches at the end of practice, indicating he's most likely not playing.\n\nBruins Will Turn Back to Swayman\n\nThe Boston Bruins are expected to turn back in goal to 26-year-old goaltender Jeremy Swayman after giving Linus Ullmark the crease in Game 1. Ullmark allowed three goals on 33 shots in Game 2 after Swayman turned aside 35 of 36 shots in Boston's 5-1 win in the series opener on Saturday.\n\nBoston bettors will be happy to see Swayman back in the crease for the black and gold, as the American netminder is a sensational 4-0-0 against the Leafs this season with a .950 save percentage. He'll have to outduel Ilya Samsonov, who stopped\n\nBoston superstar David Pastrnak got on the board in Game 2, but will need to be more of a difference maker as the series shifts to Toronto. In two road games against the Leafs this season, Pastrnak was a force, notching three points in each contest.\n\nBruins vs Leafs Player Props\n\nSpeaking of Pastrnak, he's offered at +110 to find twine for the second straight game on Wednesday night. Auston Matthews has the best anytime goal scorer odds at -145\n\nWith the public slamming Matthews in the NHL Player props, we like Pastrnak's plus-money value to find the back of the net. The Czech native tends to score in bunches, exemplified by his 10 seperate goal-scoring streaks during the regular season.\n\nPastrnak has scored four goals in his past four road playoff games, which highlights his ability to perform in hostile environments. With 19 career goals in 28 games against the Leafs, Pastrnak is terrific value to score in Game 3.\n\nWhen you take a look at the advanced metrics, it isn't hard to see which team has been better through two games. The Leafs have a 57.30 xGF% at even strength so far, while the Bruins have a 42.70 xGF%. High-danger chances are also 25-13 in favor of the blue and white.\n\nToronto has had trouble solving Swayman, however, which potentially lends way to some underdog value for the visitors. Boston was one of the NHL's best road teams this season, sporting a 23-9-9 record away from TD Garden.\n\nAlthough they aren't the better team at five-on-five so far, Boston has struck three times with the man advantage in this series. They've actually scored a power-play goal in four straight meetings with the Leafs.

The two teams exchanged one goal leads a couple times in a hard-fought contest that saw a combined eight penalties, 133 hits and 42 blocked shots.\n\nIt was a classic playoff matchup between two rivals that don't like each other one bit.\n\nThe game was there to be won in the third period, and that's when Marchand took control with two goals and one assist over the final 20 minutes of action to carry the Bruins to a 4-2 victory.\n\n\"That's a leader. That's our leader. He's a captain through and through,\" Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman told reporters postgame. \"He doesn't take no for an answer. He leads by example. He's the pinnacle of what a captain should be and we're so lucky to have him in this room.\"\n\nThe first point came on Jake DeBrusk's power-play goal 67 into the third period. The power play has been a huge weapon for the Bruins through three games, and Marchand has factored into all five of Boston's tallies (one goal, four assists) with the man advantage.\n\nThe Leafs, to their credit, didn't go away in the third period. They kept attacking and finally equalized when Tyler Bertuzzi evened the score at two with a deflection at 11:25 of the frame. It didn't take Boston long to regain the lead -- just 28 seconds, in fact -- thanks to Marchand.\n\nOn the very next shift, the Bruins captain took a pass from Danton Heinen and fired a perfect shot above Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov's left shoulder and into the net, giving his team a 3-2 advantage.\n\nMarchand didn't just contribute offensively in Game 3. He also played 4:14 on the penalty kill, a unit that went a perfect 5-of-5 against the star-studded Leafs power play. This advantage on special teams played a massive role in the outcome of the game, and Marchand made a huge difference with two power-play points (one goal, one assist) and excellent defense on the penalty kill.\n\nIt was a typical two-way performance by one of the best all-around left wings of the 21st century.\n\n\"His play, that's one, chipping in and scoring. Battling, just not backing down, and his leadership on the bench, too,\" Bruins center Charlie Coyle told reporters when asked about Marchand, per the NESN broadcast.\n\n\"The way he talks and the way he keeps us engaged and what we need to do in that given situation, whatever it calls for. He's always on top of that. It goes beyond his play on the ice, which was exceptional tonight. It's on the bench and in the locker room, his all-around leadership and character.\"\n\nAnother way Marchand impacted the game that won't get noticed on the scoresheet is him getting under the Leafs' skin. He got tangled up with Leafs forward Tyler Bertuzzi on several occasions. He played physical, annoyed the heck out of Toronto but never once crossed the line and got penalized. Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe couldn't resist complaining about Marchand's antics after his team's defeat.\n\n\"He's a world-class player, both in ability and how he plays -- the gamesmanship and everything. It's world class,\" Keefe told reporters.\n\n\"He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We gotta play through that. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series who gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in this series who gets away with that, but he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand also made Bruins history in multiple ways during Game 3.\n\nHis two goals moved him into a first-place tie with Cam Neely on the Bruins' all-time playoff goals leaderboard with 55. He moved past Neely for the most game-winning playoff goals in team history with 12. Marchand also moved past his old linemate, Patrice Bergeron, for the second-most playoff assists in B's history with 79.\n\nEven at age 35, Marchand remains fully capable of putting the Bruins on his back and carrying them to playoff victories. He has tallied 26 points (10 goals, 16 assists) in his last 15 postseason games. Marchand made his playoff debut in 2011. Only one player -- Tampa Bay Lightning star Nikita Kucherov (162 points) -- has posted more playoff points than Marchand (134) during that span.\n\nThese milestones and stats are a great example of how productive Marchand has been in clutch moments, and why he will forever hold a special place in this Original Six franchise's history.\n\nThe Bruins deserved to win Game 3, but there were large stretches of the game --particularly in the first and second periods -- where the Leafs were the better team and had the momentum. Even in the third period after Bertuzzi's tying goal, it felt like the Leafs would ride the energy of the crowd to a second consecutive victory in the series.\n\nBut Marchand wasn't having any of that. He has an enormous amount of playoff experience. He's been in these kinds of high-pressure moments many times in the last 15 years. He stepped up at the perfect time and delivered an elite postseason performance to help the Bruins regain control of the series and take back the home ice advantage.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danton_Heinen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danton Heinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Neely", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Neely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Original Six"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Bergeron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Kucherov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikita Kucherov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GQEolpUyFxrvRquJy_Vu0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/6a84c9c1fb8cb119f37a42368fd85e92", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Or the 2018 playoffs, and the 2019 playoffs. It's almost like Marchand and the Bruins are on repeat.\n\nThe cast around Marchand has changed, but the work ethic of the Bruins has not.\n\nThe Bruins went back to goalie Jeremy Swayman, one of many adjustments they made after losing game two with Linus Ullmark in net, and he was again terrific, as he had been in Game 1.\n\nMatthew Knies beat him in the second period -- on a terrific feed from Mitch Marner -- but Swayman clearly has the Leafs' number, a big reason the Leafs went 0-for-5 on the power play.\n\nTrent Frederic scored in a second period in which the referees put their whistles away, giving Boston jump that carried over to an early third-period power-play goal from Jake DeBrusk.\n\nHistory says\n\nWith Game 4 Saturday, history favours Boston.\n\nWhen the Bruins have a 2-1 lead in a series in which they have home-ice advantage, they are 18-8 all time.\n\nThe Leafs are 5-15 all time in best-of-seven series in which they trail two games to one and in which they started on the road.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Making changes\n\nWith the venue switch and the Maple Leafs getting the advantage of the last line change, it meant adjustments for both teams.\n\nBeyond goaltending, the Bruins went big with theirs.\n\nAndrew Peeke was hurt in Game 2, replaced by Mason Lohrei, who was recalled from Providence of the American Hockey League on Tuesday. Parker Wotherspoon, a healthy scratch in Games 1 and 2, skated with Kevin Shattenkirk, leaving Matt Grzelcyk as a projected scratch and ex-Leaf James van Riemsdyk saw his first post-season action, in for Jacob Lauko.\n\n\"Playoff time of year is always the best time of year,\" said van Riemsdyk. \"This rivalry is always a lot of fun, two fun buildings to play in. You cherish every opportunity you get. It's always special to get to play in this building.\"\n\nThe adjustment the Leafs wanted -- the return of William Nylander -- didn't happen. He skated for the third time in four days, but still was not cleared to play due to an undisclosed ailment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Crowd pleasers\n\nThe atmosphere was almost circus-like with Maple Leaf Square brimming with fans.\n\nThe asking price was as high as $850 for lower-bowl seat and $600 for an upper bowl seat on the resale market around an hour before the game. And the crowd was into it.\n\nFans loved the action early in the first period, both teams with early chances thanks to a power play each. The crowd was loudest for a toe save made by Samsonov on a shorthanded breakaway by Pavel Zacha and Joel Edmundson blocking a David Pastrnak shot with Samsonov out of position.\n\nAnd though no goals were scored in the first period, there were plenty of other things to cheer and jeer. A non-call of an elbow by Brad Marchand -- enemy No. 1 on the Bruins for more than a decade now - on Tyler Bertuzzi got the crowd angry. And big hits, notably by Matthews on Hampus Lindholm. One by Ryan Reaves on Pavel Zacha had the crowd chanting \"Reav-o.\"\n\nThe Bruins carried most of the first half of the period, the Leafs the second half with Keefe double shifting Marner. He played mostly with Tavares, mainly against Boston's top line. But he took spins on the other lines, as Keefe searched for a mismatch that might unleash Marner's offensive abilities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Fan effect\n\nThe officials were booed off the ice after the second period. The Leafs had earned a 1-0 lead thanks to a terrific pass from Marner to Knies and were carrying momentum. They were pressing for another in the Bruins end, but could get nowhere. The Bruins took a few liberties. None were called. There were two leading up to their equalizer. Matthews was tackled by Charlie McAvoy behind the net, getting the play to go the other way. Bertuzzi and Marchand got into it in the neutral zone, but the refs let it go, and Trent Frederic went uncontested into the Leaf end, beating Samsonov on the short-side.\n\nBut it was 1-1 heading into

After a key game in which the Maple Leafs tied the series at one game each, Keefe stressed the necessity of keeping the focus on Marchand.\n\nIn a statement shared by Mark Masters, a TSN reporter, Keefe emphasized the need for his players to remain vigilant and calculated in their approach.\n\n\"Just gotta be smart,\" Keefe said. \"Gotta recognize the moment, recognize the player & players you're playing against. They're very good at making it very clear that there's been an infraction. We got to manage that.\"\n\nKeefe's remarks highlight a strategic focus on maintaining discipline and awareness when facing off against Marchand and the Bruins.\n\nBrad Marchand recognizes Toronto Maple Leafs' playoff evolution ahead of crucial Game 3 against Boston Bruins\n\nBrad Marchand, the captain of the Boston Bruins, acknowledges the formidable challenge set by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs. Having faced them in postseason play four times now, Marchand highlights the evolution of the Leafs into a more playoff-ready team.\n\nHe notes their enhanced physicality, commitment to forechecking, and tighter defensive play compared to previous years. Despite his reputation as a contentious player, Marchand gives credit to the Leafs for their performance, particularly their offensive skills combined with their defensive tenacity.\n\n\"I mean, they're playing a really good playoff-type game right now. You know, you knew they would. They're built different than in the past years,\" Marchand said (via dailyhive.com).\n\nEven in the games where the Bruins were outshot, Brad Marchand recognizes the Leafs' quality and competitiveness.\n\n\"You've got to give them credit. They're one of the top teams for a reason. When you add their offensive ability on top of that, they're a tough team to play right now, and we're seeing it, Even the first game, it was a different game than the score.\n\n\"We have to continue to be better. It's a very tight playoff series, and we knew it was going to be a battle.\" Marchand added\n\nThe Boston Bruins, with a regular-season record of 47-20-15, face the Toronto Maple Leafs, who finished with a record of 46-26-10. The teams are evenly matched, and with the series tied at one game apiece, Game 3 promises to be a crucial encounter in determining the direction of the series.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Leafs' newfound playoff readiness and the Bruins' response as they strive to maintain their winning streak against their Atlantic Division rivals.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhilasha_aditi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Abhilasha Aditi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/23090213-1713980254.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

With the victory, Boston leads the first-round series 2-1 and Bruins captain Brad Marchand was the main catalyst of the latest triumph.\n\nMarchand scored 2 goals, including the eventual game-winning one that put Boston up 3-2 before he added his second to the Bruins' tally with a late empty-net score to make it 4-2.\n\nAfter the game, however, Maple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe couldn't believe what he had seen from Marchand in Game 3. And forgive me for the spoiler, but the coach didn't precisely discuss his goalscoring exploits.\n\n\"You've got to recognize the world-class player both in ability and how he plays, the gamesmanship and everything,\" Keefe told reporters after the game on April 24. \"It's world-class. He's been in the league long enough.\n\n\"As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. You've got to play through that. You've got to play through that stuff. It's an art. He's elite at it.\"\n\nThrough the first three games of the first-round matchup against the Leafs, the captain of the Bruins has scored 2 goals while providing his teammates with 4 assists.\n\nKeefe, however, pointed out how the antics of Marchand aren't being penalized by referees enough.\n\n\"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out (Tyler) Bertuzzi's legs the way [Marchand did],\" Keefe said. \"There's not another player in this series that gets away with that. But he does.\"\n\nKeefe's comment referenced Marchand's action seconds before the Bruins scored the game-tying goal in the second period to make it 1-1. Trent Frederic scored following Marchand's tripping of Leafs' forward Tyler Bertuzzi opening a passing lane.\n\nIt's fair to say that Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov could have done more to stop Frederic's shot, but it cannot be denied that Marchand's unpunished action helped the Bruins create a goalscoring play.\n\nLater in the game, with the Bruins already leading Toronto 3-2, Marchand seemed to complete another borderline legal action on Bertuzzi that was uncalled for a penalty.\n\nFollowing that hit, Marchand recovered a rebound and scored the final, empty-net Bruins goal.\n\nThe captain had a few more exchanges with Bertuzzi throughout Game 3, including both during the development of the action on the ice and after the final horn sounded inside the arena.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Leafs' Matthew Knies echoed Keefe's tone when discussing Marchand's actions and style of play. The Leafs player went a bit further by mentioning the referees and how Marchand seems to affect their decisions.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" Knies told reporters postgame. \"I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that (expletive). Just play hard and make him [less] effective.\"\n\nThe main perpetrator of the aforementioned actions and Keefe's Hockey Freedy Krueger touched on what happened during Game 3 and his relationship with Bertuzzi, with whom he was teammates when both played for the Bruins before Bertuzzi signed with Toronto.\n\n\"We always battle, we are similar players,\" Marchand explained in his postgame press conference on April 24. \"When you are in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, playing against each other, that all goes out the window.\"\n\n\"Bert and I get tied up one shift,\" Marchand said. \"But outside of that, I'm not really in the mix with anything. I'm just trying to play, and play a good team game. At this time of the year, it gets so emotional.\n\n\"I'm an emotional player. It's not a given that you get the opportunity in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

The two teams exchanged one goal leads a couple times in a hard-fought contest that saw a combined eight penalties, 133 hits and 42 blocked shots.\n\nIt was a classic playoff matchup between two rivals that don't like each other one bit.\n\nThe game was there to be won in the third period, and that's when Marchand took control with two goals and one assist over the final 20 minutes of action to carry the Bruins to a 4-2 victory.\n\n\"That's a leader. That's our leader. He's a captain through and through,\" Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman told reporters postgame. \"He doesn't take no for an answer. He leads by example. He's the pinnacle of what a captain should be and we're so lucky to have him in this room.\"\n\nThe first point came on Jake DeBrusk's power-play goal 67 into the third period. The power play has been a huge weapon for the Bruins through three games, and Marchand has factored into all five of Boston's tallies (one goal, four assists) with the man advantage.\n\nThe Leafs, to their credit, didn't go away in the third period. They kept attacking and finally equalized when Tyler Bertuzzi evened the score at two with a deflection at 11:25 of the frame. It didn't take Boston long to regain the lead -- just 28 seconds, in fact -- thanks to Marchand.\n\nOn the very next shift, the Bruins captain took a pass from Danton Heinen and fired a perfect shot above Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov's left shoulder and into the net, giving his team a 3-2 advantage.\n\nMarchand didn't just contribute offensively in Game 3. He also played 4:14 on the penalty kill, a unit that went a perfect 5-of-5 against the star-studded Leafs power play. This advantage on special teams played a massive role in the outcome of the game, and Marchand made a huge difference with two power-play points (one goal, one assist) and excellent defense on the penalty kill.\n\nIt was a typical two-way performance by one of the best all-around left wings of the 21st century.\n\n\"His play, that's one, chipping in and scoring. Battling, just not backing down, and his leadership on the bench, too,\" Bruins center Charlie Coyle told reporters when asked about Marchand, per the NESN broadcast.\n\n\"The way he talks and the way he keeps us engaged and what we need to do in that given situation, whatever it calls for. He's always on top of that. It goes beyond his play on the ice, which was exceptional tonight. It's on the bench and in the locker room, his all-around leadership and character.\"\n\nAnother way Marchand impacted the game that won't get noticed on the scoresheet is him getting under the Leafs' skin. He got tangled up with Leafs forward Tyler Bertuzzi on several occasions. He played physical, annoyed the heck out of Toronto but never once crossed the line and got penalized. Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe couldn't resist complaining about Marchand's antics after his team's defeat.\n\n\"He's a world-class player, both in ability and how he plays -- the gamesmanship and everything. It's world class,\" Keefe told reporters.\n\n\"He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We gotta play through that. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series who gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in this series who gets away with that, but he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand also made Bruins history in multiple ways during Game 3.\n\nHis two goals moved him into a first-place tie with Cam Neely on the Bruins' all-time playoff goals leaderboard with 55. He moved past Neely for the most game-winning playoff goals in team history with 12. Marchand also moved past his old linemate, Patrice Bergeron, for the second-most playoff assists in B's history with 79.\n\nEven at age 35, Marchand remains fully capable of putting the Bruins on his back and carrying them to playoff victories. He has tallied 26 points (10 goals, 16 assists) in his last 15 postseason games. Marchand made his playoff debut in 2011. Only one player -- Tampa Bay Lightning star Nikita Kucherov (162 points) -- has posted more playoff points than Marchand (134) during that span.\n\nThese milestones and stats are a great example of how productive Marchand has been in clutch moments, and why he will forever hold a special place in this Original Six franchise's history.\n\nThe Bruins deserved to win Game 3, but there were large stretches of the game --particularly in the first and second periods -- where the Leafs were the better team and had the momentum. Even in the third period after Bertuzzi's tying goal, it felt like the Leafs would ride the energy of the crowd to a second consecutive victory in the series.\n\nBut Marchand wasn't having any of that. He has an enormous amount of playoff experience. He's been in these kinds of high-pressure moments many times in the last 15 years.

He took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past goalie Ilya Samsonov's ear.\n\nMarchand capped the scoring with an empty-netter and also had an assist.\n\nJake DeBrusk and Trent Frederic also scored for Boston, and Jeremy Swayman made 28 saves. Swayman made 35 saves in Boston's 5-1 victory in Game 1, then gave way to Linus Ullmark in Toronto's 3-2 victory in Game 2.\n\nMatthew Knies also scored for Toronto, and Samsonov made 30 saves. Toronto was 0 for 5 on the power play and is 1 for 11 in the series.\n\nGame 4 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday night at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nToronto pulled Samsonov for an extra attacker with just over two minutes to go, but Maple Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 1:04 left and Marchand sealed it with the empty-net goal.\n\nThe Maple Leafs opened the scoring with 6:50 left in the second. Mitch Marner deftly moved past a defender and slid a pass for Knies to redirect upstairs on Swayman.\n\nBoston tied it with 2:23 left in the period when Frederic's shot went off the post and in. DeBrusk gave Boston a 2-1 lead at 1:07 of third.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

This one was a bit different through the first 30 minutes of the contest, with tight-checking, lockdown hockey. However, as soon as the Maple Leafs could find the back of the net, the game opened up.\n\nThe Bruins tied it up on a very questionable sequence that could have had three penalties called, but none were.\n\nThe Maple Leafs' top line has been good this series, and they were able to tie up the game. Unfortunately, Boston scored less than 20 seconds after Tyler Bertuzzi's tying goal, and that stood as the game-winner before they scored on the empty net to take Game 3 and a 2-1 series lead.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, many noted that the Maple Leafs' stars haven't shown up in the postseason. Well, that debate may be over after this year. Auston Matthews has shown up and been one of, if not the best, players on the ice throughout the series. Through three games, he has one goal and two assists, 16 shots on goal, and 17 hits. He has also been good in the face-off circle, with a 54.5% success rate while averaging 22:31 a game. Some could argue that this stat line isn't the best in the series, which it could be, but on every shift, he has been dominant.\n\nRelated: Toronto Maple Leafs' Top-20 Goal Scorers All-Time\n\nWith Max Domi and Bertuzzi, this line has been exactly what the Maple Leafs needed and could be the main reason they beat the Bruins in this series. If Matthews can continue to dominate his shifts, and the team can reduce their penalties, they could take hold of this series. It's been a relatively tight matchup; these teams are closely matched. Now that the Maple Leafs are down 2-1, the Bruins will try to make quick work of the Maple Leafs, which is where the top line, and specifically Matthews, must put the team on his back and try and take over the series.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch Marner has struggled in this series and has been hearing it from just about everywhere. The Toronto Sun's headline going into yesterday's game was \"Invisible Man,\" with an airbrushed portrait of Marner. As much as I recognize he has struggled, it is ridiculous to publish this after Game 2. Also, Marner was the main reason the Maple Leafs scored their first goal. He held the puck for the right amount of time and found Matthew Knies at the side of the net to tap it home.\n\nThe Maple Leafs need Marner; that is clear. He needs to find his game, but remember that he is coming off an injury that forced him to miss nearly two months. There were about two weeks of the regular season left when he returned and was put on a line with John Tavares and Bobby McMann. Now he is playing alongside Tavares and Knies, and this line doesn't have a \"play-driver.\" Marner can generate plays, but they don't have a Matthews-type player on that line. This is why William Nylander, when he returns to the lineup, should play alongside Marner, and then we should see different results.\n\nThe Maple Leafs need to stay focused and not worry about the Bruins' antics, like the commotion between Brad Marchand and Bertuzzi. They were too caught up in the missed call, and rightfully so, but it allowed Trent Frederic to walk in and score. They will need to make this adjustment and stay focused to avoid going down 3-1 in the series.\n\nThis series gets an extra day off ahead of Game 4 in Toronto. Game 4 is on Saturday, April 27, at 8:00 p.m., and this could be the biggest game of the Maple Leafs season.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_lazary@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Spencer Lazary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_net_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empty net goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_McMann", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby McMann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mitch-Marner-Maple-Leafs-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 3399, "textEnd": 3407}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He added an empty-netter to go along with an assist as part of a three-point night as the Bruins took a 2-1 series lead.\n\nThe 35-year-old forward's impact, though, went beyond the scoresheet and, perhaps, into the heads of the Maple Leafs. Marchand wrestled in the offensive zone with Tyler Bertuzzi in the second period, dropping the Toronto forward to the ice twice as part of sequence that led into Trent Frederic's second-period goal, which tied the game at 1-1.\n\n\"World-class player, both in ability and how he plays - the gamesmanship and everything,\" Maple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said of Marchand post-game. \"It's world-class. He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. You've got to play through that. You've got to play through that stuff.\n\n\"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way he does. There's not another player in this series that gets away with that. But he does. It's an art. He's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand has six points through three games in the first-round series, drawing penalties along the way, including a slashing call on Bertuzzi after a whistle in Game 2.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" winger Matthew Knies added. \"So I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that bulls---. Just play hard and make him (less) effective.\"\n\nFor his part, Marchand argued after Wednesday's win that his back-and-forth with Bertuzzi was his lone sequence of mixing it up with the Leafs.\n\n\"Bert and I get tied up one shift,\" said Marchand. \"But outside of that, I'm not really in the mix with anything. I'm just trying to play, and play a good team game.\n\n\"At this time of the year, it gets so emotional.

It's an art, and he's elite at it. So we have to manage through that.\"\n\nBertuzzi and Marchand got tangled up in the second period, with the Leafs at the time leading 1-0. Most of the 19,423 in attendance were screaming for a penalty, but instead, Trent Frederic scored the tying goal seconds later on a shot that Ilya Samsonov will certainly want back.\n\nThe Bruins would take the lead on a Jake DeBrusk powerplay tally -- his third of the series -- early in the third period before Bertuzzi tied things up midway through the frame. But the tie lasted just 28 seconds after Marchand went from bothering the Leafs on the ice to sinking them on the scoresheet.\n\nBrad Marchand downs Maple Leafs in Game 3\n\nMarchand was a thorn in the side of the Leafs all night long, and he also sunk them on the scoresheet on Wednesday. The veteran broke the 2-2 tie with under 10 minutes left in the third period before sending his second of the night into an empty net with under 30 seconds left in regulation to seal Game 3.\n\nIt was a tough loss for Toronto, who stole home-ice advantage back in Game 2 but were unable to build on the momentum of the big victory at TD Garden. Instead, the Leafs will be fighting for their lives on Saturday in a Game 4 that will feel like a must-win.\n\nGoing back to Boston down 3-1 is really not an option -- not if the Leafs hope to beat the Bruins in a playoff series for the first time since 1959.\n\n\"Little mistakes at very important times that end up in our net, but in general I just didn't think we got to our game nearly as much tonight as we did in the others,\" Keefe said about his team's game, per NHL.com's Dave McCarthy. \"Credit to Boston, they played hard, made it hard to get through the neutral zone, and I didn't think we did enough to manage through that.\"\n\nThe Leafs will have to do a better job at containing Marchand if they hope to even the series.

Game 5 is set for Tuesday in Boston.\n\nLeafs winger William Nylander took line rushes at the morning skate, but missed a third straight contest -- the Swede played all 82 in the regular season -- with an undisclosed injury.\n\nMoments after the Leafs tied things 2-2 to send Scotiabank Arena into a frenzy and then nearly took the lead off a Swayman turnover, Marchard took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past Samsonov's ear at 11:53 of the third.\n\nToronto pulled Samsonov for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go in regulation, but Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 64 seconds left before Marchand sealed it into the empty net.\n\nTied 1-1 through 40 minutes, DeBrusk bagged his third goal in as many games when he scored on a man advantage 67 seconds after the restart off a Marchand rebound when the Leafs lost structure on their struggling penalty kill.\n\nToronto's power play came over the boards a few minutes later, but couldn't connect despite a couple of great chances for Bertuzzi, slipping to 0-for-5 on the night and 1-for-11 in the series.\n\nBruins winger James van Riemsdyk hit the post on a partial break midway through the period before Bertuzzi tipped a Morgan Rielly shot off Boston defenceman Hampus Lindholm to tie the game 2-2.\n\nMarchand -- Boston's captain seemingly always in the thick of things at this time of year -- responded just 28 seconds later to give his team a lead it would never surrender to re-establish home-ice advantage.\n\nThe Leafs opened the scoring at 13:10 of the second when the under-fire Mitch Marner -- without a point through two games and the subject of intense media scrutiny -- deftly moved past a defender and slid a pass for Knies to redirect upstairs on Swayman.\n\nSamsonov stopped van Riemsdyk on a partial breakaway moments later, but the Bruins tied it at 17:37 when Frederic fired his second goal of the series in off the post on a shot the netminder will want back.\n\nThe play unfolded as Marchand and Bertuzzi got tangled up in the neutral zone, and moments after, Leafs star Auston Matthews was tackled behind Boston's net by Charlie McAvoy.\n\nToronto, which fell to Boston in seven games to open the 2013, 2018 and 2019 playoffs, was buzzing around the offensive zone on an early power play before the Bruins had the best chance on a short-handed Pavel Zacha breakaway that Samsonov turned aside.\n\nToronto defenceman Joel Edmundson made a crucial block with his goaltender out of position later in the first period on a David Pastrnak opportunity.\n\nThe Leafs had another fruitless power play before Tavares ripped a shot off the crossbar.\n\nToronto winger Max Domi then created a turnover behind the Boston net and nearly capitalized, but Swayman was there.\n\nThe home side brought some physicality as the period wound down, with Simon Benoit, David Kampf and Ryan Reaves throwing their weight around to raucous approval.\n\nMatthews hit the post early in the second and had another chance on a Marner power-play setup. Samsonov then denied Pat Maroon at the other end before the teams finally broke through.\n\nFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS\n\nVan Riemsdyk, who was a healthy scratch for the first two games, suited up in a building he called home for six seasons with the Leafs from 2012-13 through 2017-18.\n\nSCHEDULE TALK\n\nBruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about a playoff schedule that sees two days off on either side of Game 4.\n\n\"I would have rather been here Thursday/Saturday, if I'm being honest,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto's spending in

Because of this, they are now heading to Toronto with a 1-1 series tie, which is far from ideal.\n\nAfter the Bruins' loss to the Leafs in Game 2, captain Brad Marchand and Maple Leafs forward Tyler Bertuzzi were seen trash-talking each other before leaving the ice. The former teammates had a heated battle all game, so it was not all too surprising to see. This is especially so when noting that both are notorious agitators.\n\nReporters later asked Bertuzzi about what was said between him and Marchand. The 29-year-old winger said this on the matter: \"That's between me and Brad.\"\n\nA reporter then mentioned that Bertuzzi called Marchand a 'good guy' earlier in the season and asked how much he believes the Bruins captain will test that this series. Bertuzzi responded by saying, \"I'll stick with my word. It's playoff hockey. It's going to keep going.\"\n\nAs Bertuzzi noted, this kind of chippy play and chirping will continue from here. Tempers are boiling between the two big-name forwards, which should only heighten as the series rolls on. It should make for some electrifying hockey.\n\nThe Bruins will now look to get things back on track and beat Bertuzzi and the Leafs in Game 3 on Wednesday night.\n\nMaple Leafs' Tyler Bertuzzi Cheapshots Brad Marchand\n\nBoston Bruins Drop Game 2 To Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-2\n\nBruins Recall Veteran Defender from AHL Providence\n\nBruins Forward Hilariously Chirped Maple Leafs Defender", "source": {"uri": "thehockeynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey News on Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://thehockeynews.com/.image/t_share/MjA1OTYyNzc0ODUxODg4NDc0/usatsi_22921367-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Boston went on to secure a victory and take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven series.\n\n\"He gets calls,\" said Keefe of Marchand. \"It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series who gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand was a significant factor throughout the night for Boston, finishing with two goals and one assist and depositing the game-winner midway through the third period.\n\nToronto had been in control of the game early on though when rookie Matthew Knies got on the board with his first goal of the series to give the Leafs a 1-0 lead in the first period. Frederic's salvo in response appeared to be aided by lack of interference called on Marchand against Bertuzzi, and Knies acknowledged how the Leafs must adjust to manage Marchard's presence when he's on the ice.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin,\" said Knies. \"He wants to influence the refs, so I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that bullshit. Just play hard and make him [not as] effective.\"\n\nThat's easier said than done. Marchand also drew the Leafs' ire when he took down forward Auston Matthews behind the net without a call. And Marchand got involved again with Bertuzzi in the offensive zone right before pocketing the empty netter to seal Boston's win.\n\nIt was a bitter end for Toronto in multiple ways. The Leafs had not only held the lead once off Knies' goal, but after falling behind in the second off Jake DeBrusk's third score of the series. Morgan Rielly had responded to knot the score at 2-2 in the third, and just 28 seconds later Marchand' fired home his game-winning dagger.\n\n\"You've got to recognize he's a world class player, both in ability and how he plays, in the gamesmanship and everything.,\" said Keefe of Marchand. \"It's world class, and he's been in the league long enough, as you can see....we have to manage our way through that, avoid putting ourselves in situations where he can put us in those spots.

It has not disappointed in that regard through the first two games. The Maple Leafs had a 52-51 edge over the Bruins in Game 1, which included a whopping 48 hits between the two clubs in the first period alone. That mark matched the highest total recorded in any period over the entirety of the 2023-24 regular season, equaling a contest between the Maple Leafs and Bruins on March 7. The Bruins hold a 103-97 edge in the hit department going into Game 3 on Wednesday (April 24).\n\nThe Maple Leafs have gotten a bit too carried away at times, which could prove to be a troubling trend as the series progresses. However, staying on the body is typically a path to success in what often becomes a war of attrition in the postseason. Striking the right balance between being physical and staying disciplined could go a long way to a lengthy playoff run.\n\nThe penalty kill has been a sore spot for the Maple Leafs for the majority of the 2023-24 season. The team finished the regular season 23rd overall with a success rate of 76.9%. That represents the second-worst penalty-kill percentage among teams in the playoffs behind only the New York Islanders, who placed 32nd in the league (71.5%). That lack of success on the penalty kill has followed them into the postseason and was the elixir the Bruins needed to turn around their struggling power play. Despite only scoring three power-play goals on 32 chances in the final 12 games of the regular season, the Bruins netted three goals on six chances in four periods versus the Maple Leafs to begin the playoffs.\n\nRelated: Beating Marchand's Game: Maple Leafs Discipline Can Defeat Agitation\n\nThe pair of power-play markers that the Maple Leafs surrendered in Game 1 (April 20) gave the Bruins a 4-0 lead in the second period. The second tally was the result of an undisciplined slash to the wrist delivered by Max Domi to Brad Marchand following a face-off. The Bruins also capitalized on a bad cross-checking penalty by Jake McCabe at the midway point of the second period in Game 2 (April 22). The Maple Leafs were whistled for slashing and roughing infractions by Tyler Bertuzzi and Ilya Lyubushkin, respectively, at the 13:57 mark of the third period in Game 2. That kind of response is exactly what they need to avoid because it could have been a massive turning point in the contest. The Maple Leafs responded with a big kill to help even up the best-of-seven series at 1-1.\n\nThe Maple Leafs can't afford to be suckered in by the Bruins, especially with the penalty kill struggling. Marchand is one of the better players in the league at eliciting that kind of reaction, which the slashes he received from Domi and Bertuzzi attest to. After being cross-checked by McCabe, Jakub Lauko stared at the referee and smiled. They know exactly what they're doing and the Maple Leafs need to stop taking the bait. Getting involved in scrums after the play is one thing, but responding with gloved punches to the face, cross-checks to the back, or slashes is daring the on-ice officials to make a call against you. It certainly doesn't help that it's hard to tell on any given night what the standard for officiating will be. Still, it's important to keep your foot on the gas and play with physicality.\n\nThe Maple Leafs are more than capable of staying physical and keeping the penalty minutes down. They did it during the regular season, finishing second in the NHL with 2,277 hits and ranking 11th overall in penalties taken (319). From 2021-22 to 2022-23, they placed fifth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs with 38.89 hits per 60 minutes, while sitting 13th among 21 teams in penalties taken per 60 (4.40).\n\nPiling up hits is a great way to force turnovers while wearing down and disrupting the timing of the opposition. Under no circumstances should that stop. During the postseason, it is common to see hits coming from up and down the lineup. That has been the case for the Maple Leafs in Round 1 versus the Bruins. Auston Matthews was credited with six hits in Game 2 to go along with his three-point, game-winning goal performance.\n\nThe fourth line of Ryan Reaves, Connor Dewar, and David Kampf has been physical and strong on the forecheck in both matches of the series so far. They got a bit overzealous with throwing hits early in Game 1, which led to a goal against them, but the trio was much more composed in Monday's victory.\n\nThe atmosphere in Toronto for Game 3 will no doubt be electric. The players will need to control their emotions and avoid any unnecessary acts of aggression that could land them in the sin bin. For the most part, the Maple Leafs were better in Game 2 despite some hiccups that ultimately didn't prove to be costly. If they can keep up the hits, progress on the penalty kill, and continue to record the bulk of the shots and scoring chances, the series could swing in their favour.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_abbott@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Corey Abbott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Lyubushkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Lyubushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_McCabe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake McCabe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_K\u00e4mpf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David K\u00e4mpf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecheck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forecheck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ryan-Reaves-Maple-Leafs-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-07", "textStart": 538, "textEnd": 545}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 631, "textEnd": 639}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1876, "textEnd": 1884}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 2194, "textEnd": 2202}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

NHL insider reveals reason for Leafs star's playoff absence", "body": "Toronto Maple Leafs fans have been wondering about the conspicuous absence of star forward William Nylander from the playoff lineup against the Boston Bruins. The reasons for his absence in the first three games of the series have resulted in widespread gossip, in which rumors of his sickness and its possible consequences for the team's playoff prospects are passing from mouth to mouth.\n\nInsights from NHL insider Elliotte Friedman shed some light on Nylander's situation. According to Friedman's sources, William Nylander's absence is attributed to a severe migraine that has sidelined him from action.\n\nThe migraine was so bad that the team doctors did studies for the sake of ruling out the possibility of a concussion, which just made the diagnosis even more complicated.\n\nThe lack of clarity surrounding Nylander's condition has fueled speculation, particularly given the secrecy maintained by the team. Without a definitive diagnosis, conjecture has run rampant among fans and the media.\n\nWilliam Nylander's health concerns date back to previous seasons, as evidenced by his decision to switch to a tinted visor in September 2022 due to migraines experienced during the previous campaign.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding William Nylander's availability, there is optimism that he may return to action for Game 4 against the Bruins.\n\nRight now, the Maple Leafs are trailing the Bruins 2-1 in the series. Therefore, Nylander's comeback could be crucial for the Maple Leafs' playoff chances.\n\nMaple Leafs lost 4-2 to the Boston Bruins in the absence of William Nylander\n\nIn Game 3 of the first-round playoff series between the Boston Bruins and the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brad Marchand played a pivotal role in the Bruins' 4-2 victory, giving them a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nMarchand broke the tie midway through the third period with a goal assisted by Danton Heinen, then sealed the victory with an empty-netter and an assist. His agitating manner garnered criticism from the Maple Leafs, particularly coach Sheldon Keefe, who believed Marchand gained favorable calls from referees.\n\nThe game saw intense moments, including Marchand's clash with Tyler Bertuzzi in the second period, which Keefe argued went unnoticed by the officials. Trent Frederic capitalized on the ensuing chaos to score the tying goal.

After a bad Game 1 for the Core Four (minus the injured William Nylander), Game 2 saw this group mostly bounce back in a significant way.\n\nAuston Matthews led the way with an MVP-caliber performance. He picked up assists on the Leafs' first two goals, then scored the game-winner at 12:06 of the third period when he beat Bruins goalie Linus Ullmark on a breakaway.\n\nMatthews tallied three points, eight shots, six hits and went 16-of-23 in the faceoff circle. Scoring chances were 13-4 in favor of the Leafs during Matthews' 5-on-5 ice time. It was a dominant effort by one of the league's top 10 players.\n\n\"Auston with a goal and two assists. He's all over the stat sheet tonight, in so many ways he's affected the game positively for us,\" Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said after Game 2. \"But to me, just the way he worked, the way he competed, he was hard and physical winning puck battles all over the ice.\"\n\nThe real question is whether he can do it again in Game 3. There are reasons to believe he can.\n\nFor starters, the Leafs will have last line change as the home team, which will allow Keefe to play the matchup game and get Matthews on the ice against Boston's weakest defense pairing as much as possible. Matthews saw a lot of Brandon Carlo and Hampus Lindholm in Games 1 and 2. In Game 3, it could be Kevin Shattenkirk and Parker Wotherspoon (who could enter the lineup for an injured Andrew Peeke). Matthews vs. Shattenkirk and Wotherspoon is not an ideal scenario for Boston.\n\nMatthews also has been tremendous at home in his playoff career. He has scored 14 goals and 31 points in 26 career postseason matchups at Scotiabank Arena. He has nine goals and 16 points in 26 career road playoff games. Matthews also tallies more shots and is better in the faceoff circle at home.\n\nThe last time the Leafs played the Bruins in the playoffs was the first round in 2019. Matthews scored in each Leafs home game (four goals in total) during that series.\n\nJohn Tavares also woke up in Game 2 after a lackluster outing in the series opener. His power-play goal late in the second period tied the score at two and gave the Leafs some much-needed momentum entering the third period.\n\nThat tally snapped a six-game playoff goal drought for the Leafs captain. Will it help spark a resurgence for him as the series shifts to Toronto?\n\nAnother huge question mark is whether Mitch Marner can get going at home. The superstar right wing finished the regular season with 85 points in 69 games. He has scored above a point-per-game rate for six consecutive seasons.\n\nHe has been held without a point in this series and has made little impact overall. The local media in Toronto has been pretty critical of Marner since the series started. But he's fully capable of erupting at any time given his elite two-way ability.\n\nThe fact that the series is tied when the Leafs' best players didn't show up in Game 1, Marner has been subpar both games and William Nylander -- a 40-goal guy and the Leafs' leading power-play scorer this season -- hasn't played at all due to injury, is a pretty good situation for Toronto entering Game 3.\n\nThe Leafs are a high-powered offensive team. They will go as far as the Core Four takes them. If the Bruins win, or stay relatively even, in their matchups against these forwards, they likely will win the series.\n\nToronto has a massive 76-38 edge in scoring chances and a 34-15 lead in high-danger chances in all situations through two games. The ice has been tilted in the Leafs' favor most of the series, with Matthews serving as the engine driving that success. The Bruins have survived this onslaught so far thanks to a robust power play and their goalies playing fantastic through two games.\n\nIf the Bruins don't find a way to limit the Leafs' Grade A scoring chances, it will be tough for them to win this series unless Swayman and/or Ullmark play lights out. It's possible that could happen -- they are the league's best goaltending tandem -- but it's not the ideal (or easiest) path to victory.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shattenkirk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Shattenkirk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Peeke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Peeke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Line (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Carlo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Carlo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/04/Auston_Matthews-USATSI_23091659.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Another aspect of the Maple Leafs being in better shape to play on Saturday in Game 4 is that Auston Matthews should be in better health as well after playing with an illness in Game 3 on Wednesday.\n\nMaple Leafs look to reset for Game 4 with extra day of rest\n\nThe Maple Leafs will have an extra day of rest before Game 4, as they are off on Thursday and Friday, and head coach Sheldon Keefe is happy for the chance to reset before trying to tie up the series on Saturday.\n\n\"Yeah, for sure,\" Sheldon Keefe said, via Johnston. \"Not just guys who aren't playing, but some of the guys who are playing. Some guys gave us a lot here (in Game 3) and have given us a lot through this series that can absolutely benefit from the day off and some of the things they've been going through.\"\n\nOften times in playoff series, teams play every other day and it is a grind. This is a chance for both teams to regroup before playing a pivotal game on Saturday. Mitch Marner spoke on how the Maple Leafs are handling the time off.\n\n\"That's what we'll look at it as -- just (a chance to) regroup in here,\" Mitch Marner said, via Johnston. \"Hopefully, some guys can feel a little better and get back out there with us on Saturday.\"\n\nAs far as how the Bruins are handling it, head coach Jim Montgomery is not too happy with the scheduling.\n\n\"I would have rather been here Thursday-Saturday, if I'm being honest,\" Jim Montgomery said, via Johnston. \"I think we're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto's spending in Boston, and we're the home team.\"\n\nThe Bruins are looking to take a stranglehold with a win on Saturday to take a 3-1 series lead, which would give them a chance to close out the series at home in Boston in Game 5.\n\nThe Maple Leafs are trying to finally beat their nemesis in the Bruins.

Boston has an opportunity now to take a 3-1 stranglehold in the best-of-seven with another win on Saturday at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nBrad Marchand - boo, hiss - scored the winning goal with 8:07 remaining on a bullet of a shot over Toronto goalie Ilya Samsonov. He also had an empty netter.\n\nThe Maple Leafs made their own misery, going 0-for-5 on the power play. They are now 1-for-11 in the three games. Tyler Bertuzzi scored a goal, but got yet another dumb penalty that led to one of Boston's scores.\n\nThe What's Up With Willy Show is now in its sixth day and William Nylander's return to the lineup is still a Scooby Doo mystery. He participated in Wednesday's morning skate and coach Sheldon Keefe said there was a \"chance\" he could play in Game 3.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nNylander, who was second on the team with 40 goals and 98 points, appeared in all 82 regular-season games, but has missed the first three in the playoff series with an undisclosed injury. It has been cloaked in so much mystery that the sportsbook Bodog has begun to accept bets on whether Nylander will return during the series.\n\n\"He is an incredible player,\" Calle Jarnkrok, a Toronto winger, said in the morning. \"We'd love to have him in the lineup.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs rallied from 1-0 and 2-1 deficits to beat the Bruins on Monday at TD Garden. Auston Matthews was dominant. He scored the winning goal on a breakaway, had assists on the other two, was credited with six hits and went 16-7 in faceoffs.\n\nHe was absent from the Wednesday morning skate but not the game. He was shut out for the second time in the series.\n\nEach of the first two games have been hard-nosed affairs in which the opponents exchanged more than 200 hits combined.\n\n\"They are built differently than in past years,\" Marchand, the Bruins captain, said also Tuesday. \"They are a lot more physical, very committed to forechecking and playing very tight defensively. You have to give them credit. They are one of the top teams for a reason.\n\n\"When you add their offensive ability on top of that they are a tough team to play right now. It's a very tight series. We knew it was going to be a battle. They have showed up. They are playing for keeps.\"\n\nThere were some more rock-em sock-em moments. Ryan Reaves clocked Pavel Zacha in the first period; elbowed his former teammate Bertuzzi in the face and afterward was giggling on the bench.\n\nIn the best chance of the first period Samsonov stymied Zacha on a 2-on-1.\n\n\"Sammy\" chants reverberated around the rink.\n\nBefore Monday, Matthews had not scored in the previous six postseason outings. But for all the gruff that he has received from critics about his performance in the playoffs, he came in with 23 goals and 24 assists in 52 games.\n\nThe Bruins have won their past six series against Toronto, the past three in seven games. The last time Toronto beat Boston in the playoffs gas was 31 cents a gallon, Dwight Eisenhower was the U.S. President and the NHL only had six teams. That was in 1959.\n\nThings heated up in the second period.\n\nAfter Toronto failed on its third power play, Mitch Marner delivered a pass across the net to Matthew Knies, who flipped it over Jeremy Swayman for a 1-0 lead with 6:50 to go.\n\nSamsonov made a nice stop on James van Riemsdyk on a 2-on-1. Not long after that Charlie McAvoy tackled Matthew behind the Bruins net like a Patriots linebacker and then Trent Frederic clanked a puck off iron and into net. Suddenly it was 1-1 with 2:23 before the intermission.\n\nToronto went on a power play a minute later but it was short lived. Bertuzzi got his gamely dumb penalty - this time for roughing - and the teams finished the period at 4-on-4.\n\nBoston went up quickly in the third when Jake DeBrusk netted a rebound of a shot by Marchand. Tyler Bertuzzi tied at 2-2 with 8:35 to go, but 28 second later Marchand drilled a shot over Samsonov to give the Bruins the winning margin at 3-2.\n\nJeremy Swayman, who stopped 35 of 36 shots in Game 1, was back in the visitors' net. He had 28 saves and has stopped 63 of 66 shots in two games. Swayman is 5-0 against the Maple Leafs during the 2023-2024 campaign.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With star forward Auston Matthews leading the charge with an amazing Game 2, Toronto has a huge opportunity to take some control of this Eastern Conference first-round series.\n\nThere are at least three things Maple Leafs fans should watch for in Game 3 tonight. First, can Matthews continue to impact the game? He was the difference-maker on Monday, breaking out with a goal and two assists. His ability to influence the game in multiple ways -- scoring, playmaking, and physicality -- will be critical as Toronto works to establish a series lead. Watch for Matthews to try and exploit any defensive gaps left by the Bruins, especially with Boston's adjustments after Game 2.\n\nSecond, what will each team's goalie play look like? Thus far, the series has featured strong goalie play from both teams. Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman played well for Boston, and Ilya Samsonov had a strong Game 2. Ullmark, despite the loss, made several key saves in Game 2. Similarly, Swayman did the same in his Game 1 victory. The goalies from both sides must maintain this stellar level to keep their teams in the game. Both teams can score, and there's a good chance that the goalie who plays the best game will carry off the win.\n\nRelated: Beating Marchand's Game: Maple Leafs Discipline Can Defeat Agitation\n\nThird, today's question will be whether Maple Leafs fans will see William Nylander return. After missing the first two games, Nylander's return could significantly boost Toronto's offense. His ability to generate plays and score could be the x-factor Toronto needs to tip the scales in their favor. Coach Sheldon Keefe hinted at Nylander being a game-time decision; however, we've heard that before. That said, Nylander will return to the lineup soon.\n\nJust when is the question? If it's tonight, his play could energize the team and the home crowd.\n\nMitch Marner is facing significant scrutiny for what is being called a \"lackluster\" playoff performance thus far. Fans and some hockey analysts now doubt his effort and engagement during key game moments. Social media now seems involved, which never bodes well for serious discussion.\n\nThe most egregious action is that Marner avoided physical contact with Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy to make a play on a puck. His lack of contestation allowed the Bruins to regain possession. Now, the fingers are pointing at a pattern of behavior that fans say has been consistent over multiple postseasons, contributing to more general concerns about Marner's playoff desire and mental toughness.\n\nThe criticism surrounding Marner seems to have intensified, with comparisons drawn between his playoff performances and those of teammates who consistently step up under pressure. The question is whether this critique is justified.\n\nRelated: Max Domi Can Be Maple Leafs' Difference-Maker vs. Bruins\n\nIs Marner's choice an isolated play; or is it a pattern that defines him as a playoff performer? Or did it even register that he had a choice to make? We've all been in situations where we thought one thing when another happened. This is something to watch over the next few games to see what transpires.\n\nI'm reminded of a similar incident two years ago. The Maple Leafs were losing 5-0 to the Tampa Bay Lightning late in the second period, and Nylander failed to chase down a puck hard enough. Fans used that incident to generate multiple petitions to trade him. That sentiment lasted for more than a year. I don't hear much about that anymore.\n\nAs the series shifts to Toronto, the Maple Leafs can use their home-ice advantage to pull ahead. The team won Game 2 on the road in Boston, beating the Bruins for the first time this season. Matthews was in top form and played one of the most dominating games of his career. Samsonov had a solid game and the team now has the home-ice advantage.\n\nFurthermore, because Nylander wasn't traded after he failed to chase down a puck two years ago, if he can play tonight, he'll bring his 40 goals and career-high 98 points back into the lineup for the game. There's a chance that the Maple Leafs can win tonight, break their recent playoff jinx against the Bruins, and then go on to win another round-one series.\n\nRelated: Did Maple Leafs' Coach Mike Babcock Throw Nylander to the Wolves?\n\nRight now, the worm has turned. Boston is the team that needs to find answers quickly. They need to tighten their defense, better support their goalies, and hope to regain their footing away from home. Perhaps they can, and the series will go back and forth. Perhaps Toronto will take a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nThat's the thing this time of the season. The games are intense, and fans are on the edge of their seats.

But their undisciplined play popped up at the worst time.\n\nAs Tyler Bertuzzi engaged in shenanigans with Brad Marchand, an assertive Trent Frederic took advantage of a sleepy Toronto D and beat Ilya Samsonov to the short-side post a mere 4:27 after Knies' tally.\n\nBertuzzi committed a roughing penalty late in the middle frame after the refs gifted Toronto with its fourth power play attempt of the night. The Bruins wasted little time converting on the man advantage in the third as Jake DeBrusk buried a rebound for his third power-play tally of the series.\n\nThe Bruins needed another response after Morgan Rielly's shot bounced off Bertuzzi and Hampus Lindholm. They netted another quick counter 28 seconds later when Brad Marchand fired a crafty wrister over Samsonov's shoulder to put the Bruins ahead for good.\n\nAnother round of timely stops by Jeremy Swayman and an empty netter by Marchand capped off Boston's 4-2 victory. Here's what we learned after another bruising playoff tilt.\n\nFor the first half of Wednesday's tilt, Marchand's performance resembled that of another late-season slump. But staring a potential series deficit, the first-year Boston captain regained his scoring touch while toeing the proverbial fine line in a pivotal moment.\n\nMarchand tallied three points in the final frame, assisting on DeBrusk's power play tally before netting his go-ahead and empty net tallies. But he also indirectly factored into Frederic's second of the series amid a tense exchange with Bertuzzi.\n\nWith all eyes on Marchand, the Bruins reaped the benefits of their captain leading by example. He kept a steady presence as the Bruins persevered through a sluggish start, penalty trouble, and defensive lapses to set the stage for a clutch third-period performance.\n\n\"The way he talks and the way he keeps us engaged in what we need to do in a given situation whatever it calls for...he's always on top of that,\" Charlie Coyle told the media. \"It goes beyond the play on the ice, which was exceptional tonight. It's on the bench, the locker room, and his all-around character.\"\n\nConversely, the Leafs had a different response to Marchand's engagement level.\n\nMore often than not, Toronto received the benefit of the doubt, drawing five power play opportunities to Boston's three. But the top soundbites out of the Leafs camp didn't involve their 0-for-5 outing on the power play or any other performance-based outcome. Instead, their comments centered around Marchand getting under the Leafs' skin.\n\n\"He's a world-class player both in ability and how he plays. His gamesmanship and everything is world-class,\" Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said.\n\n\"He's been in the league long enough, as you can see; he gets calls. It's unbelievable how it goes. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with getting a stick between Bertuzzi's legs the way he does. There's not one other player in this series that gets away with that, but he does. It's an art, and he's elite at it.\"\n\nLike Marchand, Bertuzzi developed a knack for being an agitating but skilled forward. Given their traits on and off the ice, the two generated a healthy bond as teammates and foes.\n\nAt this time last year, Bertuzzi dazzled as one of Boston's top performers in the first-round series with Florida. A mere 12 months later, after signing a one-year deal with Toronto in the off-season, he developed into a series villain.\n\nBertuzzi received his share of boos when he touched the puck in Boston. Come Game 5; the boo birds may very well intensify after his noteworthy exchange with Marchand and subsequent infraction against Coyle during the end of the second period.\n\n\"We got along great when we were teammates, and also off the ice, we have similar interests,\" Marchand told the media of Bertuzzi. \"When you're in the playoffs and playing against each other, that all goes out the window.\"\n\nWith friendship aside, for now, the Bruins cashed in twice on Bertuzzi's errors in judgment. The former Red Wing bounced back to net Toronto's tying marker in the third, only to watch Marchand and Swayman deliver in crunch time.\n\nThe Bruins had every reason to rotate Swayman and Linus Ullmark into playoff duty right away.\n\nSwayman and Ullmark performed admirably during their respective appearances. Unlike Swayman in Game 1, Ullmark didn't receive enough offensive support, resulting in a wasted Game 2 effort.\n\nThe rotation continued into Game 3.\n\nSwayman remained poised, making multiple timely stops on primary and secondary bids in high-danger scoring areas on the power play and during 5v5 play.\n\nThe fourth-year netminder stopped 157 of 163 shots in his five starts against a potent Toronto attack. Given Swayman's impressive track record against the Leafs, the Bruins should temporarily halt their rotational schedule.\n\nBut Swayman knows nothing is a given, especially this time of year.\n\n\"I'm never going to expect anything,\" Swayman told the press. \"I'm going to earn it.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_rosenthal@boston.com", "name": "Tim Rosenthal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_net_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Empty net goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WMY3RICSDVZTB4T3LZFMVRWK24-662a487ff2bf4-scaled-e1714047190137-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Marchand was instrumental in each of the Bruins' goals.\n\nBut more than the goals, he got under the legs of Bertuzzi, the skin of the Leafs, and left Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe with some choice words, though they were more likely aimed at the officials more than Marchand.\n\n\"He's a world-class player, both in ability and in how he plays.\" Keefe said of Marchand. \"The gamesmanship. He's been in the league long enough that you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable actually. I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in this series that gets away with that, but he does. It's an art and he's elite at it. So we have to manage our way through that.\"\n\nThe Leafs talked a lot about cleaning up their mistakes (they should), about fixing the power play (1-for-11 in this series) and doing better on the penalty kill (which has surrendered five goals in 10 chances).\n\nBut unless they can figure out what to do -- or more to the point, what not to do -- with Marchand, they're going to be in trouble.\n\n\"He's obviously wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" said Leaf forward Matthew Knies. \"We've got to be composed and not kind of get into that bulls -- - and play hard.\n\nMarchand vs. Bertuzzi\n\nKnies had scored the first goal -- on a terrific pass from Mitch Marner. And the Leafs looked in control.\n\nBut Marchand was instrumental in Trent Frederic's game-tying goal. That was one of the times Marchand took down Bertuzzi in the neutral zone. There was a scrum that -- perhaps with other characters -- might have been whistled down by the officials. The refs let them rough each other up while Frederic got the puck and went down the wing unopposed to score on Ilya Samsonov and tie the game.\n\n\"That's what he does,\" Bertuzzi said of Marchand's antics. \"He's been doing it for a long time. So I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nMore Marchand\n\nMarchand's hockey smarts were instrumental in Jake DeBrusk's third-period power-play goal. The Leafs were on a power play late in the second, with Charlie McAvoy called for roughing. But shortly after the puck dropped, Bertuzzi was called for roughing. Marchand called for his teammates to rag the puck to kill as much of McAvoy's penalty as possible before the refs could blow the whistle. That limited the 4-on-4 time and gave the Bruins clean ice to start the third with a power play.\n\n\"We were trying to kill as much time off the clock as we could. We were trying to get as much power-play time out of that,\" said Marchand.\n\nIt worked, with DeBrusk scoring 1:07 into the extra man situation for a 2-1 lead.\n\nBertuzzi scored to tie the game at 11:25, off a pass from Morgan Rielly that pinballed around. Then Marchand scored at 11:53, and into the empty net at 19:24.\n\nMarchand scored his 54th playoff goal, moving within one of tying Cam Neely (55) for first place on the franchise's all-time list. It was also Marchand's 12th career game-winning goal in the playoffs, passing Neely (11) for sole possession of the most in franchise history.\n\n\"He's our leader and he drags us into the fight every night,\" said McAvoy. \"It's on us to follow behind him.

Boston captain Brad Marchand insisted this Toronto team was \"built different\" than the ones that have come before it. Coach Jim Montgomery called Auston Matthews \"the most dangerous man on the ice.\" And the plaudits didn't stop there.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt wasn't hard to figure what the Bruins were up to. The Leafs are the more talented team in this series. But if they have a well-established post-season weakness, to kindly name just one, let's call it a tendency toward midseries self-satisfaction -- a history of taking their collective foot off the gas in playoff moments that clearly require full throttle. After Toronto got the better of Boston in Game 2, feeding the Leafs' egos seemed like decent strategy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd it worked. Not that you can blame Toronto's 4-2 loss on egregious complacency, exactly. But Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe warned his team before the game the series was about to get harder.\n\n\"Boston's going to push back real hard here,\" Keefe said, \"and we're going to have to be ready for that.\"\n\nAnd when it came to the important moments of Game 3, the Maple Leafs simply weren't ready. Don't get it wrong. The Leafs more than held their own against a savvy opponent. For a lot of the night, Game 3 was apparently governed by prison rules, penalties highly optional. Tackling, most of the time, seemed OK, until it wasn't. Ditto various levels of elbowing, high-sticking and gloved punching.\n\nBut the difference was in the details -- big details like Toronto's 0-for-5 outing on the power play, now 1-for-11 in the series, an alleged strength turned liability.\n\n\"You get to two (goals) tonight, the power play needs to get you one to get to three, if not four,\" Keefe said.\n\nDitto Toronto's wobbly penalty kill, which gave up its fourth goal in three playoff games on a play that saw both defencemen Jake McCabe and Joel Edmundson find themselves in the same corner while Jake DeBrusk was left alone in front to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead.\n\n\"We've just got to do a better job of the details,\" Keefe said. \"Little details. It hasn't been the same thing. It's been different things that have led to goals against.\"\n\nErrors like that were essentially self-inflicted -- not the Bruins beating the Leafs, but the Leafs beating themselves.\n\n\"It was little mistakes at important times that ended up in our net,\" Keefe said.\n\nNot that the Leafs didn't have their moments. Not much separated the teams. And there was ruthless physicality brought from both sides. Edmundson stepped in to play goalie at one point, taking one of his team-high five blocked shots in the chest off the stick of David Pastrnak when Ilya Samsonov was caught on the other side of the crease. Ryan Reaves' late-first-period hit on Pavel Zacha, a followup to Benoit's levelling of Pastrnak moments before, brought the crowd to a froth.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd Mitch Marner was as electric as he's been as a Leaf in the early going. The game's early moments had tight checking and scant shots, times when it's easy to criticize the Leafs for trying to pass the puck into the net. To which Marner might have replied: Watch this. Marner set up Matthew Knies for the game's first goal with a pass to the net's doorstep that required only a deft stick on the ice to make the redirection into the net's gaping top half.\n\nBut the Bruins, if they can appear short of firepower, aren't bereft of fieriness. Marchand's powers of distraction were on full display late in the second period. At a moment when most of the eyeballs in the arena, including perhaps Samsonov's, were drawn to Marchand's away-from-the-puck scrum with Bertuzzi, Boston's Trent Frederic streamed down the left wing and banked a seemingly innocuous wrist shot off the post and in to make it 1-1.\n\nToronto didn't flinch when the Bruins took the lead on that DeBrusk power-play goal. Morgan Rielly banked a shot off Bertuzzi and then Lindholm to tie it 2-2 with less than nine minutes left in the third.\n\nBut when Marchand potted what turned out to be the winner 28 seconds later, it was a classic case of Toronto taking its foot off the gas. Boston's Danton Heinen won a multi-player battle for possession below Toronto's goal line and fed an all-alone Marchand for a bullet wrister that zinged past Samsonov's glove-hand ear. Marchand also scored the empty netter to seal it. After showing the Leafs all that respect this week, Boston's captain essentially took over the game and commanded his.\n\n\"Small lapses,\" Rielly said. \"After we tie the game, giving one right back is tough ... Once you take the eye off the ball, they're able to capitalize. And that's the difference.\"\n\nThe Leafs showed up. The aw-shucks, \"these-Leafs-are-different\" Bruins showed more. Eye off the ball, foot off the gas, Keefe can only hope Game 3 taught his team that, if the result is actually going to be different next time, full attention and full throttle is required.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_feschuk@thestar.com", "name": "Dave Feschuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-sticking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-sticking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_McCabe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake McCabe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_(strike)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elbow (strike)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edmundson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edmundson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Zacha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Zacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_net_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empty net goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elias Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danton_Heinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danton Heinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/b2/bb2909a4-e6a2-5d08-8eea-6d8a3986f63c/6629c73eb38d3.image.jpg?crop=1782%2C936%2C0%2C113&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Marchand's toughness, resilience and leadership helped the Bruins weather some shaky moments and earn a much-needed road win.\n\nThe veteran left wing also got tangled up with several different Leafs players throughout the game, especially Tyler Bertuzzi.\n\nThese two former teammates had an altercation during the buildup to Boston's first goal in the second period. Neither player was whistled for a penalty, which was the correct call by the referees. Does Marchand trip Bertuzzi? Yeah, kind of, but Bertuzzi went down pretty easily. Both players were going at each other. You can penalize both or just let it go. The latter is typically the right call.\n\nMarchand also sealed the 4-2 win with an empty-net goal late in the third period. He took out Bertuzzi's legs along the boards shortly before he scored. No penalty was called.\n\nLeafs head coach Sheldon Keefe praised Marchand after the game, calling him \"world class.\" He then complained about the Bruins captain's ability to draw calls and get away with stuff.\n\n\"He's a world-class player, both in ability and how he plays -- the gamesmanship and everything. It's world class,\" Keefe told reporters.\n\n\"He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We gotta play through that. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series who gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in this series who gets away with that, but he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nDoes Marchand sometimes get away with stuff? Of course. He's an elite pest, in addition to being one of the best all-around left wings in the sport. He also drew zero penalties in Game 3, so it's not like he was getting a ton of calls. Bertuzzi and Max Domi have been doing similar stuff all series, too.\n\nThe Leafs had a 5-3 advantage in power plays in Game 3, and at one point four consecutive penalties were called on the Bruins. Toronto has had 11 power plays in the series, one more than Boston.

This allows their goaltenders, whether it be Jeremy Swayman or Linus Ullmark, to be the difference.\n\nFor the Maple Leafs, who finished second in the NHL in goals per game this season, the best path to a win is to make life easy on their mercurial goaltender, Ilya Samsonov, and keep things tidy so that their elite playmakers can provide the big moment in a tight contest.\n\nThat is not how you'd expect a series between the Bruins, known for their stout defense and commitment to structure, and the Maple Leafs, known for their high-octane offense, to play out.\n\nBut each team's strengths and weaknesses in this particular season are pushing this series in that direction.\n\nToronto's blue line is a liability with the puck, so that puts pressure on the forwards to think defense-first and not cheat.\n\nThe Leafs can ill-afford mistakes, knowing that falling behind by multiple goals will be tough sledding against Boston's goaltenders and defense corps.\n\nThe Bruins will look to exploit those weaknesses by being aggressive on the forecheck and forcing Toronto's defensemen into making mistakes.\n\nThat means playing with a little more risk in their game in order to increase the pressure on the Leafs when they have the puck.\n\nOn top of all of this is the fact that these are two evenly matched teams.\n\nThe Bruins were a slight favorite to win the best-of-seven, but no series in Round 1 had tighter odds than Boston vs. Toronto.\n\nAfter splitting the first two games, the betting market has deemed this thing a coin flip, which is essentially where the odds for Game 3 currently sit.\n\nThat all makes sense. The Bruins were the better team in Game 1, but Toronto showed some resolve in Game 2 to get the series back on level terms.\n\nThe Leafs had to come back from a pair of one-goal deficits and allowed Auston Matthews to be the difference-maker in the end.\n\nAnd while Matthews is one of the best players on the planet and is one of a few skaters who can win a best-of-seven on his own, it's not a formula that seems all that sustainable.\n\nToronto, which has played both games without William Nylander, will need more production from Mitch Marner and stronger play from its defense corps to keep up with the Bruins, but even then it's still hard to be sure that Samsonov will be composed throughout this series.\n\nThe Bruins will need to find a way to slow down Matthews, especially in Toronto when the Leafs will get the last change, but if they can do that they should have the edge in Game 3 and beyond.\n\nMatthews could very just take over and that may be enough to win this series, but there are just too many question marks beyond No. 34 to view this series as a coin flip, even if Toronto now has home-ice advantage.\n\nBoston's goaltending and Toronto's haphazard defense give enough of an edge to the Bruins in this best-of-seven.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/bruins-leafs.--e1713910765961.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

After a bad Game 1 for the Core Four (minus the injured William Nylander), Game 2 saw this group mostly bounce back in a significant way.\n\nAuston Matthews led the way with an MVP-caliber performance. He picked up assists on the Leafs' first two goals, then scored the game-winner at 12:06 of the third period when he beat Bruins goalie Linus Ullmark on a breakaway.\n\nMatthews tallied three points, eight shots, six hits and went 16-of-23 in the faceoff circle. Scoring chances were 13-4 in favor of the Leafs during Matthews' 5-on-5 ice time. It was a dominant effort by one of the league's top 10 players.\n\n\"Auston with a goal and two assists. He's all over the stat sheet tonight, in so many ways he's affected the game positively for us,\" Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said after Game 2. \"But to me, just the way he worked, the way he competed, he was hard and physical winning puck battles all over the ice.\"\n\nThe real question is whether he can do it again in Game 3. There are reasons to believe he can.\n\nFor starters, the Leafs will have last line change as the home team, which will allow Keefe to play the matchup game and get Matthews on the ice against Boston's weakest defense pairing as much as possible. Matthews saw a lot of Brandon Carlo and Hampus Lindholm in Games 1 and 2. In Game 3, it could be Kevin Shattenkirk and Parker Wotherspoon (who could enter the lineup for an injured Andrew Peeke). Matthews vs. Shattenkirk and Wotherspoon is not an ideal scenario for Boston.\n\nMatthews also has been tremendous at home in his playoff career. He has scored 14 goals and 31 points in 26 career postseason matchups at Scotiabank Arena. He has nine goals and 16 points in 26 career road playoff games. Matthews also tallies more shots and is better in the faceoff circle at home.\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n\nThe last time the Leafs played the Bruins in the playoffs was the first round in 2019. Matthews scored in each Leafs home game (four goals in total) during that series.\n\nJohn Tavares also woke up in Game 2 after a lackluster outing in the series opener. His power-play goal late in the second period tied the score at two and gave the Leafs some much-needed momentum entering the third period.\n\nThat tally snapped a six-game playoff goal drought for the Leafs captain. Will it help spark a resurgence for him as the series shifts to Toronto?\n\nAnother huge question mark is whether Mitch Marner can get going at home. The superstar right wing finished the regular season with 85 points in 69 games. He has scored above a point-per-game rate for six consecutive seasons.\n\nHe has been held without a point in this series and has made little impact overall. The local media in Toronto has been pretty critical of Marner since the series started. But he's fully capable of erupting at any time given his elite two-way ability.\n\nThe fact that the series is tied when the Leafs' best players didn't show up in Game 1, Marner has been subpar both games and William Nylander -- a 40-goal guy and the Leafs' leading power-play scorer this season -- hasn't played at all due to injury, is a pretty good situation for Toronto entering Game 3.\n\nThe Leafs are a high-powered offensive team. They will go as far as the Core Four takes them. If the Bruins win, or stay relatively even, in their matchups against these forwards, they likely will win the series.\n\nToronto has a massive 76-38 edge in scoring chances and a 34-15 lead in high-danger chances in all situations through two games.

Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Bruins played better on offense, defense, and special teams in Game 3 against the Toronto Maple Leafs, but the biggest difference for them came in goal with Jeremy Swayman.\n\nThe 25-year-old was sharp for the second time in the series, shepherding the Bruins to a 4-2 win in Game 3 with a 28-of-30 performance (.933) against the high-powered Maple Leafs. Toronto needed an odd-man rush against a gassed defense, and some puck luck off a Bruin and in, to solve Swayman in this one.\n\nLeafs netminder Ilya Samsonov, meanwhile, allowed three goals on 33 shots (.909). The talent disparity in net glared the brightest during a notable sequence in the third period, when the teams traded power plays, and only the Bruins cashed in.\n\nFaced with chances to make big point-blank saves on the penalty kill, Swayman made one, and Samsonov did not. In fact, Swayman made two, which at the time kept the Bruins clinging to a 2-1 lead.\n\nShortly before that, Jake DeBrusk gave the Bruins their first lead of the game when he corralled a rebound and fired it past Samsonov at the doorstep.\n\nGranted, that was far from an easy play for Samsonov to make. But the Bruins' other two scores on him were. Trent Frederic straight-up beat him short-side from 20-plus feet out, while Brad Marchand sniped him over his glove-side shoulder. Swayman made no such blunders.\n\nThe Bruins benefitted from a higher volume of shots, out-shooting the Maple Leafs (34-30) for the first time in the series. It's clear, at this point, that it's worth testing Samsonov as much as possible, because he's obviously the inferior goaltender.\n\nAnd at the other end, Swayman's big saves, rebound control, and freezes have all been both impressive and timely. He's made it a legitimate conversation for Jim Montgomery and the Bruins, whether to keep him in goal for Game 4 and possibly beyond. We know what he would like to happen.\n\n\"For me personally, I don't want rest, I just want to keep playing,\" Swayman said after the game. \"I think no matter when I get the call, whether it's back-to-back or every other game, I want to make sure my body's ready, and I'm ready to perform at my best.\"\n\nThe Bruins made a few lineup adjustments ahead of Game 3, in part out of necessity due to injuries on defense. They did a better job generating chances on offense and suppressing the Leafs on defense, as a result. But if it all comes out a wash in front of the two goaltenders, the B's have a significant advantage at the last line of defense.\n\nOnly question for Swayman, now, is how soon he plays again.\n\nGet complete Boston Bruins coverage at 985TheSportsHub.com.\n\nMatt Dolloff is a writer and podcaster for 985TheSportsHub.com.

They've scored six goals in their first three games against the Boston Bruins -- three in their win, one and then two in the losses.\n\nIt's a familiar problem for the Leafs, one that's been haunting them since the back half of their playoff run last season when they ran out of goals at the wrong time against the Florida Panthers.\n\n\"We have to find a way to convert on those chances,\" Kyle Dubas, then the Leafs GM, said not long afterward. \"And we have to find a way to build in different offensive principles that can allow us to produce more at those key moments.\"\n\nGoals scored in the last 10 Leafs playoff games look like this: 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.\n\nIt dates back even further than that though. Over the last five postseasons, including this one, the Leafs have scored 2.76 goals per game during the playoffs, down from 3.52 goals per game during the regular season.\n\nToronto's front office -- with Brad Treliving taking over for Dubas as GM -- was well aware of the problem. While there was a lot of talk about \"snot\" in the aftermath of the signings of Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi last July, most of their appeal was in the offence they might provide in support of the stars come playoff time.\n\nAnd indeed, Bertuzzi and Domi have a goal each through three games.\n\nThe Leafs haven't found enough elsewhere.\n\nAuston Matthews and John Tavares each have one goal so far (Matthews did set up two goals in Game 2) and Mitch Marner has yet to score. Marner has registered only four shots in three games.\n\nThe Leafs have really felt the absence of William Nylander, a 40-goal man during the regular season who has yet to play in this series. They should get him back for Game 4 on Saturday. They need him, badly.\n\nA big part of the problem so far: The power play, minus Nylander, has scored only once on 11 opportunities.\n\nThey had legitimately great chances in Game 3. Matthews wrung one shot off a post. Bertuzzi was robbed by Jeremy Swayman twice while swimming around the crease. But ultimately, five opportunities (one cut short by a Bertuzzi roughing penalty) came and went with no goals.\n\nLeafs coach Sheldon Keefe noted the two goals scored in defeat.\n\n\"The power play needs to get you one to get you to three, if not four,\" he said. \"And then it's a good night offensively in the playoffs against an elite defensive team like they are and the type of game that it is.\n\nThough they finished seventh overall on the power play during the regular season, the Leafs cratered down the stretch of the regular season (also something that's happened in previous seasons). From March 1 onward, the Leafs scored on just 12.5 percent of their opportunities, the fourth-worst mark in the entire league.\n\nInjuries were partly to blame: The Leafs didn't have Marner, a focal point for entries and puck movement, for a dozen games. And they've not had Nylander at all in this series.\n\nNylander operates from the flank opposite to Matthews, posing a two-pronged problem (he's equally great at shooting and passing the puck) for opposing penalty kills to deal with. He led the team with 35 power-play points during the regular season.\n\nTake him away and there's even less space for Matthews, who led the team with 18 power-play goals during the regular season. Matthews hasn't scored yet on the power play in the series and has landed only three shots on goal.\n\nHaving Nylander back should help him find cleaner looks. Marner filled Nylander's spot on PP1 in Games 1-3. His shot doesn't pose anywhere near the same threat as Nylander, nor is he anywhere near as likely to shoot it, period.\n\nMarner has just one shot on the power play so far against the Bruins.\n\n\"We're getting our looks, we really are,\" Marner said. \"It's just staying confident in it, knowing that we have the people in here to make it successful.\"\n\nBut again, this is not a new problem for the Leafs.\n\nAside from last year, the power play - with the same personnel up top - has struggled to convert in past playoffs.\n\nIs there something about the personnel, which leans far more on finesse than grease, that prevents them from converting at the same rate in the postseason?\n\nThe Leafs have scored only five five-on-five goals to this point - 2.18 per 60 minutes. That number was almost three per 60 during the regular season, second-best in the league.\n\n\"I think you've just gotta capitalize on your chances,\" Morgan Rielly, who set up Bertuzzi's goal in Game 3, said. \"I don't think there's gonna be an abundance of offensive zone time where you're rolling around and really controlling the play.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nGame 3 was mostly a defensive slugfest, with not much going on either way for large chunks of the game. The Bruins made it especially hard for the Leafs to wade through the neutral zone and then get anywhere near their net.\n\nThe two goals the Leafs did manage to score were templates for the kind of goals they'll need to score more of to come back and beat the Bruins. In both instances, they attacked the blue paint - first Matthew Knies and then Bertuzzi - and were rewarded for it.\n\nDomi scored the first Leaf goal in Game 2 similarly. He cashed in on a Matthews rebound.\n\nWhere the goals will come from moving forward remains a question.\n\nThe Leafs fourth line of Connor Dewar, David K\u00e4mpf, and Ryan Reaves will crash and bang, but they are unlikely to provide much more offensively than the goal K\u00e4mpf already offered in a Game 1 loss.\n\nTavares' line has been dueling with David Pastrnak's group all series. They got the Leafs one in Game 3, their first goal all series, in a strong two-way effort.\n\nHow much can they score, should they be expected to score, given their role in keeping things square against Pastrnak?\n\nUsing Marner in shutdown duty almost feels like a waste of his offensive gifts. He is a reigning Selke Trophy finalist and the Leafs have quietly excelled defensively in this series, particularly against Pastrnak. Marner's line performed expertly in Game 3 especially: Expected goals were almost 87 percent for the Leafs when they were on the ice. And that was with zero offensive zone faceoffs.\n\nKeefe and his staff are almost stuck between building a lineup that's going to be able to defend and one that's going to score enough. The defending has been there so far. The scoring, not so much.\n\nThe Leafs almost need Matthews' line to score in every game. And while they carried the Leafs, led by Matthews, to a win in Game 2, the line was much less effective in Game 3. They got the Leafs their second goal and then gave it right back moments later.\n\nAll the underlying metrics were right around even. Bertuzzi and Domi have both gotten lost at times in the Brad Marchand sideshow. Keefe has replaced Bertuzzi with Marner for the occasional offensive zone faceoff throughout this series, something he might have to do more often moving forward.\n\nNylander's return for Game 4 will punch things up immensely. Barring wholesale changes, Keefe will likely deploy him on the third line alongside Pontus Holmberg and Calle J\u00e4rnkrok and hope that he can threaten against the weaker cogs in the Boston lineup.\n\nThe Nylander-on-the-third-line thing didn't really work in the regular season though. Also: How will he respond after more than a week off with whatever it is that's been bothering him?\n\nThe Leafs may get to a point in this series where they have no choice but to take a different route as far as the Pastrnak assignment goes, one that frees at least one of their better offensive players, Marner or Tavares, up for more offence.\n\nCould they replace Marner with J\u00e4rnkrok, for instance? Or might they even want to revert back to a look that sees Domi centre a third line that can threaten more offensively? Or, will they remain stuck on having Domi and Bertuzzi both alongside Matthews?\n\nKeefe resisted wholesale change after a Game 1 loss and was rewarded for it. He's been much more restrained in his lineup tinkering in this postseason.\n\nHow much longer will that last - can it last?\n\nIf the power play comes around, maybe major tinkering won't be required.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_siegel@theathletic.com", "name": "Jonas Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dubas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dubas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_Holmberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pontus Holmberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_K\u00e4mpf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David K\u00e4mpf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

Marchand was the best player on the ice, scoring two third-period goals and adding an assist.\n\nIn addition to contributing on the score sheet, Marchand did a lot of the little things to lift his team. Unsurprisingly, that involved mixing it up with the Maple Leafs, going back and forth with Tyler Bertuzzi all night. Toronto wasn't pleased with how Marchand's game was officiated, though, with Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe even taking a shot at the Boston captain in his postgame press conference.\n\nGiven a chance to respond to Keefe's gripes, Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery instead decided to praise Marchand's maturation and ability to meet the moment on the biggest stage.\n\n\"That's new, I think it's age, right? But the two years, last year, I don't think he took a penalty last year in the playoffs,\" Montgomery said in his postgame press conference. \"Obviously, everybody in the playoffs targets the other team's best players, and he gets targeted. He still manages to get under people's skin, and he doesn't cross the line. It's something you have to tip your cap to him because of his maturation as a player and as a person.\"\n\nQuite frankly, Keefe's postgame comments are more likely gamesmanship than an actual critique of Marchand. He wants more opportunities for his team, despite Toronto going 0-for-5 on the power play Wednesday night, so he brings that up after the game to bring even more attention to it. The hope is the Leafs then get a call in Game 4.\n\nBut as Montgomery pointed out in his praise for Marchand, there's something to be said for not dwelling too much on the moment and instead moving on.\n\n\"I just think there's a burning intensity in him to win, and he doesn't care about what just happened,\" Montgomery said. \"Good or bad, it's gone, and he's onto what's next.\"\n\nThe Bruins hope what's next for them is a Game 4 win.

It's world-class,\" Keefe said after the game, per NESN.\n\n\"He's been in the league long enough as you can see. He gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes.

He toes the line of decency -- sometimes stepping over it (like the time the league had to tell him to stop licking people) -- and can get under people's skin like a parasite. He's one of the league's ultimate examples of a player you hate... unless he's on your team.\n\nWhy do you think they call him \"The Rat?\" It's not because he's a perennial frontrunner for the Lady Byng.\n\nThis makes Marchand a nightmare in a seven-game series and the Leafs are seeing that yet again. He's got six points through just three games, including the game-winner and an empty-netter on Wednesday, but it's not just the scoring that is a problem for Toronto.\n\nMarchand's borderline (which is putting it mildly it, it was a trip) take-down of Tyler Bertuzzi allowed Trent Frederic to take advantage of the extra room to tie the game at 1-1 in the first period.\n\nThat was just one of the times that Bertuzzi -- who played for the Bruins late last season -- and Marchand came together.\n\nGame 4 will be on Saturday in Toronto, and it'll be interesting to see if and how the Leafs try to contain Marchand, something that is much easier said than done.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_reigle@outkick.com", "name": "Matt Reigle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Byng_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Byng Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/04/keefe-marchand.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But my Bruins vs. Maple Leafs predictions for Wednesday, April 24 are looking for value elsewhere.\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Boston Bruins moves north of the border for tonight's Game 3 showdown with the series knotted at one game apiece.\n\nThe Leafs have to be pretty happy with the outcome through the first two games. They've controlled play pretty well, have matched Boston's physicality, and seem to have Auston Matthews firing at will after a monstrous game two.\n\nWhat could he possibly have in store for an encore?\n\nHis line -- Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi flank him on the wings -- has been the most dominant trio in the early going, averaging 5.87 expected goals per 60 with a 75% high-danger rate. Sure, it's been a small sample size, but it's also a continuation of how those three ended the regular season averaging a league-best 6.51 goals per 60 minutes of play.\n\nThrough two playoff games, Matthews and Domi have been the beneficiaries of this high-octane production, but Bertuzzi gets his due tonight and finds the back of the net for some juicy value (+260).\n\nHe was a beast on Monday night with five shots on goal. Technically, he had a sixth shot that hit the twine but was disallowed due to a high stick. However, that shows that Bertuzzi has a knack for being in the right spots.\n\nBased on his five-goal playoff output in just seven games for Boston in 2023, we know this to be the case. Furthermore, the underlying numbers through the first couple of games suggest that his play should yield a goal soon. He's second on the team with seven shots on goal and eight credited individual scoring chances, with four of them being of the high-danger variety, according to Natural Stat Trick.\n\nOne of these chances is bound to go in for Big Bert, and he offers significantly better value on this market than Matthews, who is listed at -143 to score tonight.\n\nGrabbing the game's first goal will be crucial for the Leafs, who will feed off the home crowd's energy. Plus, Toronto scored first in 58% of their games this season.\n\nFor my final leg, I like the Leafs to go Over their team total of 2.5 goals. Despite being held to just four goals through two games, the Leafs have 4.04 expected goals per game. Tonight, they'll need to convert more of those chances to win. Perhaps William Nylander's return could give them a boost.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have hit the third period moneyline in four of their last five games.

Who better than their captain, Brad Marchand?\n\nMarchand's goal-scoring was a down a bit during the regular season and he had just three goals in the 17 games leading up to the postseason. He went the first two games against the Leafs without lighting the lamp, though he had three assists and had added another early in the third period Wednesday night to give the Bruins a 2-1 edge.\n\nSo Marchand was due. And when the Bruins needed a goal in a hostile environment to get them back on track in the series, he came came through. After Tyler Bertuzzi tied it up at 2-2 with 8:35 left in the game, Marchand put the Bruins back on top just 28 seconds later.\n\nDanton Heinen fed his captain with a nice pass from behind the net and Marchand took care of the rest, sniping one over the glove of Toronto goalie Ilya Samsonov to give Boston a 3-2 edge.\n\nMarchand sealed the deal for Boston with an empty-netter with 36 seconds left. He won yet another battle with Bertuzzi in front of the net and put in his second of the game to give the Bruins a 2-1 series lead.\n\nThat second goal was Marchand's 55th of his postseason career, tying Cam Neely for the most in Bruins history. Neely set that record in 1995, when seven years old. That empty-netter was also Marchand's 12th game-winner in the postseason, which passed Neely for the most in B's history.\n\n\"Those are things that you kind of look at down the road and look back upon and get excited about,\" Marchand said after the victory. \"Hopefully there is plenty more in the tank, but to be in the company of a guy like that who is one of the most gifted goal-scorers in the history of our franchise and the game, it's pretty special.\"\n\nThe two goals from Marchand won Boston the game, but he put the team on his back in a number of ways Wednesday evening. He led the team in short-handed minutes, as Boston successfully killed off all five of Toronto's power plays. He also led the way with a game-high six shots on net, and it was his juicy rebound that led to DeBrusk's goal early in the third. That came after Marchand won a battle for the puck along the boards, one of the many battles he won throughout the game.\n\n\"We stuck with it all game, it wasn't always pretty and I said it the other day, they're coming very hard, they're playing very physical,\" said Marchand. \"But I thought we elevated to another level from where we had been at the first couple of games and it was great it paid off.\"\n\nAnd as is usually the case, there was an agitation factor to Marchand's game as well. It was agitator vs. agitator as Marchand tangled with Bertuzzi all night, with Marchand usually getting the better of his former teammate. Ahead of Boston's first goal of the game, Marchand got into a lengthy battle with Bertuzzi as the two jostled for position. Marchand's stick got between Bertuzzi's skates and sent the forward to the ice. Bertuzzi was begging for a call as Trent Frederick gave Boston a 1-0 lead, but got nothing from the officials.\n\nMarchand was under the skin of the Leafs all night, and had Toronto head coach Sheldon Keefe voicing his displeasure with the officiating after the game.\n\n\"He gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes,\" Keefe said, via USA Today. \"You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in the series that gets away with that, but he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nYou know it's a playoff series when a head coach starts complaining about the officiating. Let the mind games begin.\n\nThe Bruins will look to take a commanding 3-1 series lead in Game 4, which is set for Saturday night in Toronto.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Neely", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cam Neely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danton_Heinen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danton Heinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pest (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/25/b61cbeb0-599c-4ff3-a685-bd8255da164a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/0abab4011f6d7083b305585bc543f843/brad-marchand.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nSHARKS: Last-place team fires coach David Quinn\n\nBertuzzi, also known for his peskiness, played for Boston last season in the playoffs after the Bruins acquired him at the 2023 trade deadline. He and Marchand were going at each other throughout Wednesday's game.\n\nAfter Bertuzzi tied the game 2-2 at 11:25 of the third period, Marchand responded 28 seconds later with a perfect shot into the top corner of the net.\n\nThe Bruins captain added an empty-net goal after first knocking down Bertuzzi. He leads Boston with six playoff points in three games.\n\n\"He's a great player,\" Bertuzzi said. \"That's what he does. He's been doing it a long time. I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nMarchand has 55 playoff goals, tying Cam Neely's franchise record. He passed Neely to take the lead with his 12th playoff game-winning goal.\n\n\"He obviously wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" said Toronto's Matthew Knies, who scored the opening goal. \"I think we just have to be composed and not kind of get into that (expletive).\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Quinn_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Quinn (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Neely", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Neely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He is trending toward a return to the lineup, according to league sources, after skating multiple times in recent days.\n\nThe Leafs should also have top-line center Auston Matthews back in better health after he played through an illness during Wednesday's 4-2 loss. That explains why he was the only regular to miss the morning skate at Scotiabank Arena -- opting instead for more rest -- and helps account in part for a night when he didn't look like his usual explosive self though still logging another 23-plus minutes.\n\nGiven the team's struggles on special teams and the 2-1 deficit it is facing in the series, you won't hear the Leafs complaining about a drawn-out schedule that will see them face the Bruins just once in the next five days. It presents an opportunity to reset while allowing for the various injury situations they're managing to improve.\n\n\"Yeah, for sure,\" Keefe said Wednesday night. \"Not just guys who aren't playing, but some of the guys who are playing. Some guys gave us a lot here (in Game 3) and have given us a lot through this series that can absolutely benefit from the day off and some of the things they've been going through.\"\n\nIt should be particularly useful for Matthews, who has skated 67:33 so far in the series -- more than everyone except for Boston's Charlie McAvoy (77:00) and Hampus Lindholm (69:25), and Leafs teammate Morgan Rielly (72:43), all defensemen.\n\nDespite not being 100 percent on Wednesday, Matthews delivered a team-high eight hits and fired seven shots at the Bruins' goal. One of those struck a post and another sailed through Jeremy Swayman's arm and body, only to deflect out wide.\n\nLeafs players are due to take Thursday completely off before practicing on Friday. By the time the puck drops at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, roughly 70 hours will have elapsed since the final buzzer sounded on Game 3.\n\nThat's a luxury not often afforded to teams in the middle of a playoff series.\n\n\"That's what we'll look at it as -- just (a chance to) regroup in here,\" Mitch Marner said. \"Hopefully, some guys can feel a little better and get back out there with us on Saturday.\"\n\nNylander hasn't played since waking up the morning after the regular-season finale in Tampa, Fla., not feeling quite right. The Leafs finished with back-to-back games against the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning, and he skated just shy of 35 combined minutes in those contests.\n\nWith speculation mounting about the reason for his absence and the team offering little in the way of official updates on his status, Nylander was then held completely off the ice for three days before participating in a skate with the Game 1 scratches on Sunday afternoon in Boston.\n\nHe labored through it, repeatedly hunching over his knees between drills.\n\nNylander went on to take the morning skates with teammates before Games 2 and 3, noticeably ramping up his work rate and exertion on Wednesday. His demeanor shifted, too, and he could be seen smiling, laughing and offering encouraging words to teammates.\n\nComing off a 98-point season -- the best of his NHL career -- Nylander's anticipated entrance into the series represents a big boost for a Leafs team struggling to put the puck behind Swayman.\n\nThe team is just 1-for-11 on the power play against Boston so far, and Nylander would presumably bump Tyler Bertuzzi back to the second unit.\n\nThe Bruins, meanwhile, seemed less enthused about the wait they're now enduring before Game 4.\n\n\"I would have rather been here Thursday-Saturday, if I'm being honest,\" head coach Jim Montgomery said. \"I think we're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto's spending in Boston, and we're the home team.\"\n\nKeefe pointed out that the schedule is the same for both teams participating and mentioned that the Bruins also gain time to soothe any bumps and bruises. But they haven't been playing without a top scorer.\n\n\"Coming off a loss, it gives us a chance for sure to take a breath, regroup,\" Keefe said. \"It's been a lot of hockey here for us since we had to go out on the road to finish the regular season until now. It's been a lot of hockey for our guys.\n\n\"We've played hard. At times, we've played well.\"\n\nTheir chances of playing better should go up considerably with Nylander back in the lineup and Matthews closer to full health.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_johnston@theathletic.com", "name": "Chris Johnston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/25011409/GettyImages-1848455610-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Sheldon Keefe confirms Leafs star's Game 3 status after missing morning skate", "body": "The Toronto Maple Leafs are getting ready for the crucial Game 3 against the Boston Bruins on Wednesday. Fans expect star center Auston Matthews to lead the charge once again.\n\nAfter missing the morning skate, speculation arose about Matthews' availability for this game. However, coach Sheldon Keefe has put those doubts to rest, confirming that Matthews will take the ice against the Bruins.\n\nNHL insider Chris Johnston provided an update on the situation, tweeting:\n\n\"Sheldon Keefe says 'there's a chance' William Nylander plays tonight. Will depend on how he responds to extra work this morning. Auston Matthews is good to go tonight, per Keefe.\"\n\nMatthews' presence has made a difference for the team, so his availability is a relief for Leafs fans. In Game 2 against the Bruins, Matthews' skills were on full display: he scored a goal and racked up two assists in the 3-2 win, as the Leafs leveled the series at 1-1.\n\nMatthews' form is the deciding factor for the Leafs. In game 1 he failed to score any pointsm and the Leafs lost to the Bruins. When he held the frontline strongly in the next game, the Leafs came back strong and beat Brad Marchand's team.\n\nMatthews owned the regular season in terms of goals, scoring a whopping 69 goals and 107 points in 81 games, racking up the fourth-highest total in Toronto's history.\n\nThe top position is held by Doug Gilmour (127 goals in 1992-93 season. In second spot is Darryl Sittler (117 in 1977-78). The third spot is held by Gilmour with 111 in 1993-94 season.\n\nAuston Matthews narrowly missed the 70-goal mark earlier in the regular season loss to the Lightning where he was held without a point despite 12 shots on goal.

Nylander appears to be nearing a return to the Maple Leafs' lineup. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Chris O'MearaTORONTO - William Nylander seems to be getting closer. The Maple Leafs winger also still isn't quite ready join the playoff fray. Nylander missed a third straight game to open Toronto's first-round series with the Boston Bruins on Wednesday as he continues to work his way back from an undisclosed injury. The 27-year-old took part in line rushes alongside Calle Jarnkrok and Pontus Holmberg at Wednesday's morning skate after missing the first two contests of the Original Six matchup, but stayed out late on the ice at Scotiabank Arena with the projected scratches. Nylander's spot in the lineup was once again taken by rookie forward Nick Robertson. Toronto centre Auston Matthews skipped the morning skate, but was good to go for Game 3. The sniper, who had 69 goals in the regular season, scored the winner and added two assists as part of a monster performance in Monday's 3-2 victory in Boston. Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said there was a chance Nylander - who was also on the ice Monday morning with his teammates ahead of Game 2 at TD Garden, but didn't take line rushes - would suit up in front of the home fans Wednesday. The Swede instead missed a third straight contest after suiting up for all 82 in the regular season. Nylander put up 40 goals for the second straight campaign and set a career-high with 98 points in 2023-24, but registered just four assists over his final 11 appearances down the stretch. \"He means a lot to this team,\" said Leafs winger Mitch Marner, who's without a point in the series. \"He's done a lot for us offensively to make our team excel.\" Nylander has missed time due to illness at different points in his career, but hadn't been sidelined with an injury since November 2016 until this series. The Leafs and Bruins are meeting in the first round for the fourth time in 12 years. Boston won the three previous series - 2013, 2018 and 2019 - in seven games. Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about the uncertainty around Nylander's status Wednesday. \"I'm hoping he's not playing,\" Montgomery deadpanned. Nylander had four goals and 10 points in 11 playoff games last spring as Toronto won a series for the first time in nearly two decades. He's combined for 17 goals and 40 points in 50 career post-season contests. \"We've had some guys go out with major things and some guys really step up - nothing really different now,\" Marner said of Toronto's roster depth. \"Just make sure we're doing the same thing, same course, trusting everyone through the lineup.\" The Leafs and Bruins will have 48 hours off between Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-seven series. Keefe has been pleased with his group's response minus one of its key contributors through six periods of playoff hockey. \"You keep pressing on,\" he said of life minus Nylander. \"How you need to play and what's required to win at this time of year is the same no matter who's in or out.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 24, 2024. ___ Follow @JClipperton_CP on X.",

Keefe called Brad Marchand an artist. He praised the Bruins' captains' ability to avoid getting penalties called on him.\n\nMarchand and Tyler Bertuzzi have spent much of the series trading crosschecks, slashes, shoves and chirps during the play and behind it. The two players who were teammates in Boston last year had an especially long back-and-forth in the second period that didn't earn either player a penalty.\n\n\"You have to play through it. He's a world-class player both in ability and how he plays in terms of gamesmanship and everything else,\" Keefe said. \"He's been in the league long enough as you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable actually how it goes. No other player in the league gets away with taking Bertuzzi's legs out the way that he does. There's no other player in the series who gets away with what he does. It's an art and he's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand didn't get an assist on Trent Frederic's game-tying goal, but his tussle with Bertuzzi helped create the opportunity for it. He set up Jake DeBrusk's goal that put the Bruins up 2-1 and 28 seconds after Bertuzzi tied the game, he put the Bruins back ahead 3-2.\n\nHe added an empty netter to seal it.\n\nLeafs forward Matthew Knies said the Leafs have to handle him better.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin and influence the refs, so I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that bullshit,\" he said. \"Just play hard and make him (less) effective.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_net_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empty net goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/2UVYQEKMQBCSNPJFP2QOBVJM6U.jpeg?auth=c28928565563ac6f84d6be70304381ffdc62e454db31bcb6e48f7e2725bad4aa&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

One playoff series win since 2004.\n\nBefore their current series against the Boston Bruins, someone pointed out that the last time the Leafs beat them was 1959.\n\nAs if the Leafs players and the franchise needed more pressure heaped on them.\n\nThere could be a lot riding on the Maple Leafs' performance in this post-season.\n\nWinning their first playoff series in 19 years last spring didn't save Kyle Dubas, who stepped down or was fired (depending on who's telling the story) as GM last May. Dubas landed on his feet with the Pittsburgh Penguins, where he has his hands full trying to rebuild their aging roster without actually calling it a rebuild.\n\nBut I digress. The Leafs are under a lot of pressure this year. Winning this series would mercifully end those 65 years of post-season futility against the Bruins, but another second-round exit won't please the Cup-hungry denizens of Leafs Nation.\n\nHeaven help the Leafs if they fall to the Bruins once again.\n\nExiting in the first or second round could cost some folks their jobs.\n\nBrad Treliving took over as GM last summer, so he's probably safe.\n\nThe same cannot be said for coach Sheldon Keefe or team president Brendan Shanahan.\n\nFollowing the Leafs' opening game loss to the Bruins on Saturday, the Toronto Sun's Steve Simmons observed how much Shanahan needs a playoff run after 10 years as club president. He also noted Keefe needs one after five years behind their bench.\n\nSimmons seemed to suggest both men could feel the heat if the Leafs fell short again.\n\nTurning to the players, superstars Auston Matthews and William Nylander aren't moving after signing expensive contract extensions.\n\nMitch Marner is a year away from UFA eligibility. So is captain John Tavares, whose best seasons are behind him. Both have full no-movement clauses, so they won't become trade candidates unless they want out.\n\nThe Leafs Nation's Steven Ellis believes this post-season will be make-or-break for pending UFA goalie Ilya Samsonov. Fellow UFAs Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi could also get their walking papers.\n\nNo pressure at all.\n\nRelated: Marner's Invisible?

Boston won the three previous series -- 2013, 2018 and 2019 -- in seven games.\n\nBruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about the uncertainty around Nylander's status Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm hoping he's not playing,\" Montgomery deadpanned.\n\nNylander had four goals and 10 points in 11 playoff games last spring as Toronto won a series for the first time in nearly two decades. He's combined for 17 goals and 40 points in 50 career post-season contests.\n\n\"We've had some guys go out with major things and some guys really step up -- nothing really different now,\" Marner said of Toronto's roster depth. \"Just make sure we're doing the same thing, same course, trusting everyone through the lineup.\"\n\nThe Leafs and Bruins will have 48 hours off between Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-seven series.\n\nKeefe has been pleased with his group's response minus one of its key contributors through six periods of playoff hockey.\n\n\"You keep pressing on,\" he said of life minus Nylander. \"How you need to play and what's required to win at this time of year is the same no matter who's in or out.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_Holmberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pontus Holmberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calle_J\u00e4rnkrok", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calle J\u00e4rnkrok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original Six"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/MKFUQE5GLBDUVA5TWO4M3OKAJA.jpg?auth=6e97b5fdcb222f2777baacba5ea379cc30b8c5734aad9de44393b0f625314e9a&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 1665, "textEnd": 1678}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThroughout the Stanley Cup playoffs we'll be keeping track of all the action around the league, and bringing you all of the results in one place.\n\nBoston Bruins vs. Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nThis series shifted to Toronto for Game 3, and after the Leafs managed to even things up in Game 2, they were hoping that home ice would offer them the boost needed to pull ahead in the series, but the Bruins had other plans.\n\nIt was a somewhat slow, somewhat even beginning to this game, as we had a good bit of back and forth early but still hit the first intermission scoreless. It wasn't until well past the midway point of the second period that anyone was able to break through, and this time it was Matthew Knies managing to deflect a puck in while crashing the crease, giving the Leafs the lead. This lead, though, would be short-lived, as just over four minutes later, the Bruins were able to tie things up on a goal from Trent Frederic.\n\nThe third period is when things really started to open up. The Bruins gained their first lead of the game just over a minute into the frame on a power play goal by Jake DeBrusk. The Leafs were able to tie things up again just past the 11 minute mark as Tyler Bertuzzi was able to get one past Jeremy Swayman, but then just 28 seconds later, the Bruins turned around and managed their own counterpunch, and Brad Marchand put them on top again.\n\nThe Leafs managed a bit more pushback, but ultimately things sort of imploded on them at the end. With just over a minute left in regulation, John Tavares committed a tripping penalty while the Leafs had the goalie pulled, thus sending the Bruins to the power play, where the Leafs once again pulled the goalie, and the Bruins scored the empty net goal (Marchand again) to seal the win.\n\nBack in Dallas, the Stars were hoping to pick up one win on home ice to tie up the series, but after how well the Golden Knights showed in their first meeting, this was going to be a difficult task.\n\nThat Stars started well, even managed to grab the first lead of the game on a big goal by Jason Robertson, but that lead would be short lived, as the Golden Knights came back just under a minute and a half later, and Jonathan Marchessault quickly got them even again.\n\nAnd it would be Vegas who ultimately came out on top in this one, and in somewhat cruel fashion to Stars fans. Dallas was able to hang around and keep things interesting, but Vegas managed not one but two back breakers of goals -- first, with just 1:09 remaining in the second period, Noah Hanifin scored to extend their lead to two goals, and then ultimately Jack Eichel put away the empty netter with 34 seconds remaining to seal it. And the Golden Knights thus have swept the away games in Dallas.\n\nThe other game out West, this between the Kings and Oilers, managed to be even tighter still.\n\nAfter dropping their first meeting in Edmonton, the Kings came out pretty hot for this second game, and managed to put up, in the first period, a big lead, thanks to a pretty singular effort from Adrian Kempe (he scored his first just three minutes into the game and then added another just over 10 minutes later, with a huge deflection goal on the rush).\n\nThe Oilers weren't going to go away quietly, though, and they responded just a few minutes later, with a goal by Brett Kulak able to cut the Kings' lead in half... only to then see it restored 29 seconds later by Drew Doughty.\n\nThe second period saw a bit less action, but still the Oilers chipping away at that lead. Through a nice little burst of production in the second period (care of Dylan Holloway and Zach Hyman on the power play), the Oilers were able to pull themselves back to even again. The third period, then, was something of a whole new game, but we didn't see things break open quite like they did early on -- the Kings again pulled back into the lead when Kevin Fiala scored inside the two minute mark, but the Oilers didn't let them keep building on that, and tied things up again (thanks to Holloway again) just 1:37 later. And that tie would remain unbroken through the duration of the period, try as both sides might to break it.\n\nSo it would take overtime to decide this one, and mercifully for all watching but especially those on the East Coast, it was a brief one -- just 2:07 into the period, Anze Kopitar was able to beat Stuart Skinner for the game winner (and to even up the series).", "source": {"uri":

Up front, Max Domi and Tyler Bertuzzi have provided netfront jam in top-six roles, while Ryan Reaves has doled out plenty of welts (and right hooks) on the checking unit.\n\nOn the blue line, brawn has been prescribed in the form of 6-foot-5 Joel Edmundson, Simon Benoit (245 hits), and Ilya Lyubushkin (168 hits).\n\nBut the more things change, the more they stay the same. At least, when it comes to first-round meetings between the Leafs and Bruins, apparently.\n\nBecause on Wednesday night, Boston's 4-2 win in Game 3 followed a familiar script: With the Bruins landing punches against an uber-talented but deeply flawed lineup -- and a pained Scotiabank Arena crowd once again silenced by hockey's best heel in Brad Marchand.\n\n\"I guess now I witnessed it firsthand,\" Jim Montgomery said of Marchand's performance on Wednesday. \"But I love watching hockey. And even if I wasn't coaching in the NHL, I was watching him and [Patrice] Bergeron and what the Bruins were doing because they've always been an elite team. And he's always risen to big moments.\"\n\nMarchand's two-goal salvo in the third period and his continued pestering of former teammate Tyler Bertuzzi will understandably draw plenty of the headlines after Boston's road triumph.\n\nBut the Bruins have built themselves a 2-1 series lead by capitalizing on the several critical deficiencies present on Toronto's top-heavy roster.\n\nAs evidenced in Game 2, Matthews and Toronto's offense can decimate even the stingiest defenses on any given night, especially during 5-on-5 play.\n\nBut Boston still holds a sizable edge over its Original Six foe when it comes to both special teams and goaltending -- and it may not be particularly close.\n\nLook no further than Wednesday night, where a soft, short-side goal relinquished by Ilya Samsonov gave Boston new life in the second period of play.\n\nEven though Samsonov has made some timely saves in this series, he's also been prone to coughing up some seeing-eye tallies like the one Trent Frederic wristed home from the left circle. A steady dosage of shots should continue to make life miserable for Samsonov, who sported an .890 save percentage over 40 regular-season games.\n\nAs Samsonov let Boston back into Wednesday's contest, Jeremy Swayman snuffed out some of Toronto's most promising offensive zone sequences. With a 28-save performance in Game 3, Swayman is now 5-0-0 against the Maple Leafs this season (postseason included), sporting a .957 save percentage over that stretch.\n\nBe it Swayman or Linus Ullmark, the Bruins should hold a decided edge in net throughout this series -- especially with Swayman playing at this level against a high-scoring Toronto team.\n\nBoston's strong play in net has been reflected during special teams play, with Toronto's power play now just 1-for-11 through three games.\n\n\"Well, our goaltender has been really good,\" Montgomery said of Boston's 5-for-5 showing on the penalty kill in Game 3. \"Like, Toronto is getting a lot of chances. We are doing a good job in a lot of areas but they're still going to get their chances, so you need a good goaltender.\"\n\nBoston and Toronto have both scored five goals at 5-on-5 play so far this series, but the Maple Leafs hold the sizable advantage when it comes to actual scoring chances (78-48) through three games and 137:22 of 5-on-5 reps.\n\nBut that momentum hasn't carried over with Matthews and Co. when a black-and-gold sweater heads to the sin bin. Swayman and Ullmark have served as the primary equalizers on Boston's PK unit, but Toronto's 5-on-4 woes have been in place long before their first-round matchup with the Bruins.\n\nEntering the playoffs, Toronto's man advantage cashed in on just nine of its last 72 opportunities (12.5%). That's even worse than Boston's beleaguered power play, which operated at 17.9% from March 2 to April 16.\n\nBut as Toronto's power play keeps on sputtering through the postseason, the Bruins have righted the ship in that same area -- with Boston now 5-for-10 on power-play bids through three games against the Leafs.\n\n\"Your power play needs to get you one to get you to three if not four [goals],\" Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said postgame. \"And then it's a good night offensively in the playoffs against a defensive team like they are and with the type of a game that it is. So it's a big part of it.\"\n\n\"Our power play has got to find ways to get one. I thought the power play was alright tonight. Had some good looks in tight around the net that we didn't make good on, but we gotta find a way to get those in. ... Special teams, again, [was] a major factor in the game tonight.\"\n\nThe Bruins still have more to give offensively, especially during 5-on-5 play. Boston has elevated its physicality (168 total hits through three games) but still needs to create more on the forecheck to extend its O-zone time.\n\nBut even if Toronto keeps on controlling play during 5-on-5 action (especially if Nylander returns from injury), the Leafs' odds of delivering a knockout punch against Boston seem to be dwindling.\n\nBecause unless the Bruins' stellar goaltending bottoms out -- and Toronto's lackluster PK unit solves itself in record time -- Boston should be able to take advantage of an opponent high on talent, but lacking in terms of D-zone fortitude.",

The sniper, who had 69 goals in the regular season, scored the winner and added two assists as part of a monster performance in Monday's 3-2 victory in Boston.\n\nLeafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said there was a chance Nylander -- who was also on the ice Monday morning with his teammates ahead of Game 2 at TD Garden, but didn't take line rushes -- would suit up in front of the home fans Wednesday.\n\nThe Swede instead missed a third straight contest after suiting up for all 82 in the regular season.\n\nNylander put up 40 goals for the second straight campaign and set a career-high with 98 points in 2023-24, but registered just four assists over his final 11 appearances down the stretch.\n\n\"He means a lot to this team,\" said Leafs winger Mitch Marner, who's without a point in the series. \"He's done a lot for us offensively to make our team excel.\"\n\nNylander has missed time due to illness at different points in his career, but hadn't been sidelined with an injury since November 2016 until this series.\n\nThe Leafs and Bruins are meeting in the first round for the fourth time in 12 years. Boston won the three previous series -- 2013, 2018 and 2019 -- in seven games.\n\nBruins head coach Jim Montgomery was asked about the uncertainty around Nylander's status Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm hoping he's not playing,\" Montgomery deadpanned.\n\nNylander had four goals and 10 points in 11 playoff games last spring as Toronto won a series for the first time in nearly two decades. He's combined for 17 goals and 40 points in 50 career post-season contests.\n\n\"We've had some guys go out with major things and some guys really step up -- nothing really different now,\" Marner said of Toronto's roster depth. \"Just make sure we're doing the same thing, same course, trusting everyone through the lineup.\"\n\nThe Leafs and Bruins will have 48 hours off between Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-seven series.\n\nKeefe has been pleased with his group's response minus one of its key contributors through six periods of playoff hockey.\n\n\"You keep pressing on,\" he said of life minus Nylander. \"How you need to play and what's required to win at this time of year is the same no matter who's in or out.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 24,

Chipping in score-wise, but battling, just not backing down and his leadership on the bench to the way he talks and keeps us engaged in what we need to do in that given situation, whenever it calls for, he's always on top of that.\n\nSo, it goes beyond just play on the ice which was exceptional tonight. It's on the bench, in the locker room and it's all around leadership and character.\"\n\nOne of Marchand's goals was on the power play, another area in which the Bruins excelled over the Leafs in the matchup.\n\nBoston was 2-for-3 on the man advantage and held Toronto scoreless on five shorthanded situations.\n\n\"Special teams can be a big factor in these games and sway momentum pretty good,\" Coyle said. \"If you dial in on that and get the job done and execute, it can be huge for you and it can sway momentum and dampen theirs.\"\n\nHere are more notes from Wednesday night's Bruins-Maple Leafs game:\n\n-- Marchand's two goals brought his career total to 55 and tied him with Cam Neely for the most playoff goals in franchise history. Marchand took over sole possession of the most game-winning goals in Bruins playoff history with the 12th of his career. He passed Neely who has 11.\n\n-- Jeremy Swayman made 28 saves for Boston for his second win of the series. In the last two seasons against the Leafs, Swayman is 6-0-0 with a 1.31 goals-against average and a .959 save percentage, per Sportsnet Stats.\n\n-- DeBrusk scored his third power-play goal of the series. He now has nine goals and five assists in 17 postseason games against the Leafs.\n\nDeBrusk also had seven hits in 17:08 minutes of ice time, including 3:01 shorthanded.\n\n\"Oh yeah, wow, no wonder why I'm bagged,\" DeBrusk told Adam Pellerin, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. It's a collective effort. Your best penalty killer is your goalie, and Sway made some massive saves. ... But, yeah, that makes a lot of sense; three minutes of PK time, I'm feeling that.\"\n\n-- The Bruins will look to extend their series lead to two games when they face the Leafs in Game 4 on Saturday. Puck drop from Scotiabank Arena is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET.

Max Domi and Tyler Bertuzzi have provided net-front jam in top-six forward roles, while Ryan Reaves has doled out plenty of hits (and right hooks) on the checking line.\n\nOn the blue line, brawn has been prescribed in the form of 6-foot-5-inch Joel Edmundson, Simon Benoit, and Ilya Lyubushkin.\n\nBut the more things change, the more they stay the same. At least when it comes to series against the Bruins, apparently.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Bruins' 4-2 win in Game 3 followed a familiar script, with damage done against that talented but flawed Toronto lineup and a pained Scotiabank Arena crowd once again silenced by hockey's best heel in Brad Marchand.\n\n\"I guess now I witnessed it first-hand,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said of Marchand's performance. \"But I love watching hockey. And even if I wasn't coaching in the NHL, I was watching him and [Patrice] Bergeron and what the Bruins were doing, because they've always been an elite team. And he's always risen to big moments.\"\n\nMarchand's two-goal salvo in the third period and his continued pestering of former teammate Bertuzzi will draw plenty of the headlines, but the Bruins got themselves a 2-1 series lead by capitalizing on the critical deficiencies in Toronto's top-heavy roster.\n\nAs evidenced in Game 2, Matthews and Toronto's offense can overcome even the stingiest defense on a given night, especially during five-on-five play. But the Bruins still hold the advantage in special teams and goaltending -- and it may not be particularly close.\n\nLook no further than Wednesday night, when a soft short-side goal relinquished by Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov gave the Bruins new life in the second period.\n\nThough Samsonov has made some timely saves in this series, he also has been prone to softer tallies like the one Frederic wristed home from the left circle. A steady dose of shots should continue to make life miserable for Samsonov, who had an .890 save percentage over 40 regular-season games.\n\nAs Samsonov let the Bruins back into the game, Jeremy Swayman snuffed out some of Toronto's most promising chances. After his 28-save performance, Swayman is now 5-0-0 against the Maple Leafs this season, with a .957 save percentage.\n\nThe Bruins' strong play in net is reflected in Toronto's 1-for-11 power-play success through three games.\n\n\"Well, our goaltender has been really good,\" Montgomery said after the Bruins went 5 for 5 on the penalty kill in Game 3. \"Like, Toronto is getting a lot of chances. We are doing a good job in a lot of areas, but they're still going to get their chances, so you need a good goaltender.\"\n\nThe Bruins and Leafs each have five goals at five-on-five play in the series, but Toronto holds a sizable advantage in actual scoring chances (78-48).\n\nThat momentum hasn't carried over to the power play. Swayman and Linus Ullmark have been the primary equalizers on the Bruins' penalty-killing unit, but Toronto's woes there have been in place long before this series.\n\nEntering the playoffs, Toronto's man advantage had cashed in on just nine of its last 72 opportunities (12.5 percent). That was even worse than Boston's beleaguered power play, which operated at 17.9 percent from March 2 to April 16.\n\nBut as Toronto's power play keeps on sputtering, the Bruins have righted the ship in that area, now 5 for 10 through three games.\n\n\"Your power play needs to get you one to get you to three if not four [goals],\" Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. \"And then it's a good night offensively in the playoffs against a defensive team like they are and with the type of a game that it is. So it's a big part of it.\n\n\"Our power play has got to find ways to get one. I thought the power play was all right tonight.

And I talk to my kids about it and their dreams of playing at this level. And to realize that we're living it, I just kinda woke up with that gratitude that we're lucky to be here -- and you want to want to make the most of this opportunity.\"\n\nPerhaps a different team, a different leader sprung from a different athletic culture, might arrive at Scotiabank Arena concerned about a squandered home-ice advantage or worried that, jeez, do we have any answer for Auston Matthews in beast mode?\n\nMarchand's tone at the Bruins' morning skate, however, turned apprehension into anticipation. Coach Jim Montgomery picked up on the little man's big vibes early.\n\n\"I saw the way our captain was. I just knew we were going to have a good game. I didn't know we're gonna win -- because the Leafs are good hockey team -- but I knew we were coming to play,\" Montgomery explained.\n\n\"He started barking the first drill before I got out. It's three minutes early. He goes, 'Let's go!' I loved it.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs hated it.\n\nThey despise that Marchand is averaging two points per game in this series, that his fingerprints are all over both sides of the special-teams battle they're losing, and that this ninja of hockey's dark arts has drawn two key penalties while taking none of his own.\n\nThat the series' true Invisible Man is provoking and punishing without getting penalized. A jewel thief in plain view.\n\n\"You gotta recognize he's a world-class player, both in ability and how he plays, in the gamesmanship and everything,\" opposing coach Sheldon Keefe said.\n\n\"He gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. But we gotta play through that, gotta play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out [Tyler] Bertuzzi's legs the way that he does. There's not one other player in the series that gets away with that. But he does.\n\n\"It's an art, and he's elite at it.\"\n\nMontgomery counters, because in playoffs everyone hears the ref's whistle filtered through their own logo: \"Everybody in the playoffs targets the other team's best players. And he gets targeted, and he still manages to get under people's skin, and yet he doesn't cross the line. It's something that you just got to tip your hat to him, because of his maturation as a hockey player and as a person.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs recognize the threat. Now they must find a better way to deal with it.\n\n\"He obviously wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" Matthew Knies said. \"We've just got to be composed and not get into that bull -- - and just play hard and make him least effective.\"\n\nMarchand was at his most effective plying his craft inside a nasty, tight, exhilarating 133-hit affair Wednesday.\n\nHe tangled himself up with off-ice pal Bertuzzi while Trent Frederic snapped Boston's first goal off a rush. He had the primary assist on Jake DeBrusk's power-play strike. He logged 4:14 on a heavily taxed yet perfect penalty kill.\n\nThen, with the score knotted 2-2, he snapped the game winner, high and clean, with about eight minutes to go and pumped in an empty-netter for good measure.\n\nDeBrusk has been drinking in Marchand's inciting cocktail of magic and menace since he joined the room. He says the captain is at his best when he's drawing clusters of chaos early and often and after.\n\n\"When he gets in his Little Ball of Hate mode, that's usually when good things happen for the team,\" smiles DeBrusk. He echoes Keefe's message of Marchand thriving in the grey.\n\n\"Well, I think he's learned the hard way,\" DeBrusk goes on. \"It's a dicey game. It's one of those ones where it can go bad, and it can go good. And I think he just tries to play to his strengths. And sometimes the strengths are getting in the face of the opponents and being annoying and being somebody that you wouldn't want to play against.\"\n\nWould you want to play against a sneaky, two-way forward who has amassed 16 points over his past 10 playoff games, while only taking two penalty minutes?\n\nWho has 134 points in 149 playoff games and just broke Bruins president Cam Neely's franchise record for playoff game-winning goals, with his 12th?\n\n\"Emotionally, he's our leader. He drives the fight every night. And it's on us to follow right behind,\" explains Charlie McAvoy, inspired by Marchand's pep talk.\n\n\"What he said about gratitude this morning, and realizing where you are, and these series, they go fast. These opportunities, you got to work for them. You'll blink, and it'll be over. I love that. And I thought we had emotion this morning, and we carried it through the night.\n\n\"Regardless of the ups and downs of the game, he kept ... the energy high, and we were able to bounce back from everything that we faced tonight.\"\n\nAdds a locked-in Jeremy Swayman: \"That's our leader, and he's a captain through and through. He doesn't take no for an answer. Leads by example. He's just a pinnacle what a captain should be, and we're so lucky to have him in this room.\"\n\nMarchand, whose history of fines and suspensions requires an accountant, freely admits that it has taken him years of mistakes and line-crossing and face-licking to \"just play,\" but he'll argue that he hasn't done anything too egregious through the first 180 minutes of this series.\n\n\"At this time of the year, it gets a little emotional, and I'm an emotional player,\" Marchand says. \"You need to be able to keep that intact. I thought we've done a really good job of that so far as a team. We're playing hard between the whistles and not emotionally going over that line.\"\n\nLeft unsaid: Marchand has been an expert at luring the Maple Leafs over that line, then making them pay for it.\n\n\"I just think there's a burning intensity to win,\" Montgomery says. \"And he doesn't care about what just happened. Good or bad, it's gone. He's on to what's next.\"\n\nFox's Fast Five\n\n* Toronto is right there with Boston at even-strength, but the special-teams battle is so lopsided, it's threatening to decide the series.\n\nThe Bruins' power play went 2-for-3 in Game 3, while Toronto's went 0-for-5.\n\nAll told, Boston's power play is outscoring Toronto's 5-1, despite having one less opportunity during the series.\n\nEvery single skater registered at least one hit Wednesday.\n\nKeefe believes the upcoming two-day break will help not only Willian Nylander's chance to draw in, but also heal some bruises.\n\n\"Guys who gave us a lot here today and have given us a lot through this series can absolutely benefit from the day off and some of the things we've been going through,\" he said. \"But it's gonna benefit Boston as well.\"\n\n* Just a little 'stitious?\n\nSammy's slick salmon suit secures a second selection:\n\n* The Maple Leafs -- ironically, a team constructed for offence -- have scored three goals or fewer in 10 consecutive playoff games. That's an NHL record.\n\n* Montgomery is not thrilled that an extra off-day is taking place in Toronto (between games 3 and 4). He would've preferred a Thursday-Saturday schedule.\n\n\"We're spending more time in Toronto than Toronto is spending in Boston,\" he noted. \"We're the home team.\"", "source": {"uri":

One of the most prominent of those free agents was Tyler Bertuzzi, who had just come off a 10-point performance in the first round of the 2023 playoffs with Boston - the team the Leafs are now facing in the first round of the 2024 playoffs.\n\nAnd while Bertuzzi got off to a slow start in the regular season, he ended the campaign with 21 goals and seemed to be poised for success in the post-season once again.\n\nIt's only been three games - and only one win for Toronto - but Bertuzzi has shown himself to be exactly the type of player the Leafs needed. In fact, they could use another couple of guys like him up front.\n\n\"Everybody is important,\" said defenseman Morgan Rielly. \"With 'Bert,' he seems to enjoy these intense games that can be physical and it's great to see, but it's up to everybody to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nBertuzzi's strengths lie in his net-front play and his willingness to get dirty in the offensive zone. If there was a major fault in last year's Maple Leafs team, it was an unwillingness or inability to go to the middle of the ice in the offensive zone. That was one of the major reasons they lost to the Florida Panthers and they weren't alone; the Panthers also took away that area from the Carolina Hurricanes in the conference final and dispatched them with ease. The Vegas Golden Knights, however, had no problem stomping through Florida's defenses and the result was a lopsided championship for Vegas.\n\nAnd yes, Bertuzzi recognizes the importance of that coveted ice.\n\n\"Definitely,\" he said. \"You try to get pucks on net, converge on the net and get those secondary opportunities.\"\n\nHis goal in Game 3 came as a result of his guile. Sure, the puck went off his skate and then off the skate of Bruins defenseman Hampus Lindholm before getting past goalie Jeremy Swayman, but it was Bertuzzi's positioning and willingness to get in front of the net that allowed the pinballing to take place.\n\nBertuzzi has also begun a pitched battle with former teammate Brad Marchand and the two had some epic sessions in Game 3, jawing and whacking away at each other. Infamously, no penalty was called on Marchand during one of those jousts when he sent Bertuzzi to the ice and the missed infraction was made even worse by the fact Boston scored seconds later, but Bertuzzi knows who he is up against and wasn't about to complain about Marchand after the game.\n\n\"He's a great player,\" he said. \"That's what he does and he's been doing it for a long time and I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nDon't expect Bertuzzi to stop, either. If the Maple Leafs are going to wrest this series away from the Bruins, they'll need more players to go to the net and take the eyes away from Boston's goalie, because Swayman has already proven himself to be near-impossible to beat on conventional shots so far (and Linus Ullmark, who played Game 2, is no pushover, either).\n\nToronto has definitely been physical in the series, so it's not a matter of intimidation overall - if anything, Boston's David Pastrnak seemed to be the most frustrated with how many times he was rocked during Game 3 - but with the power play sputtering and goals always harder to come by in the playoffs, the Leafs need to cram the Boston net more. They need to think more like Bertuzzi.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_kennedy@miamiherald.com", "name": "Ryan Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/9g1q7z/picture288007630/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fd728926-f72c-47bd-95fa-69f75ae88ed8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It's Adrian Kempe batting a puck out of the air for a goal and Drew Doughty scoring on a breakaway despite not actually shooting the puck. It's Morgan Rielly firing well wide and the puck hitting two bodies on the way into the net.\n\nIt's upsets and chaos and no prediction is safe.\n\nAnd yet, as sure as the sun rises in the east, the Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a first-round playoff crisis. Again.\n\nWednesday night's Game 3 loss to the Boston Bruins at Scotiabank Arena had all the hallmarks of Toronto's recent playoff struggles.\n\nA power-play outage that failed to convert despite several excellent scoring chances? Check.\n\nA strong game from the opposing goalie while the Maple Leafs netminder allowed a softie? Yes and yes.\n\nOfficiating controversies that only add to the anxiety? Yep.\n\nA mysterious and undisclosed injury to one of Toronto's stars that's kept him out of the lineup for three games? Actually, that one's new. And since we're talking new things, how about the decision of radio announcer Joe Bowen to take to social media to shame the sleepy Scotiabank Arena crowd into acting like it hasn't been forced to sit there as punishment? When the play-by-play guy is sounding the Klaxon, things are dire.\n\nThe only surprising thing about any of this is that amid playoff hockey's Random Outcome Generator, events are unfolding so true to expected form.\n\nThe Maple Leafs' offense has been among the most high-powered in recent years and was again this regular season, second only to Colorado in goals scored. Then the postseason hits and the Leafs skate straight into the dead-puck era.\n\nToronto scored at least four goals in 44 games this season. The last time the Leafs scored at least four in a playoff game was 11 games ago when they put five past Tampa Bay in last year's first round. Other than their three-goal explosion against Boston in Game 2 on Monday, they've scored exactly twice in nine of their last 10 playoff games. In the other one, they scored once.\n\nThat consistency, in playoff terms, is baffling. Reasons can be offered for the annual spring slowdown, and they usually are: The Leafs are too reliant on skill to create offense, or they're too soft, or they're too top-heavy. Where is the sandpaper, Leafs Nation cries in unison. But even if you allow those criticisms, and overlook the fact Toronto's front office has been on something of an annual grit-acquisition strategy for years now to supplement its high-skill core, you'd think the odd playoff game would result in a scoring outburst just because these things happen. Ten of 16 playoff teams have at least four goals in one first-round game through Wednesday night.\n\nAt the other end of the ice, it's not that goaltender Ilya Samsonov has been consistently poor. Rather, the goal he allowed in the second period of Game 3 - a Trent Frederic shot from distance that beat him short side - continued a Leafs tradition of a weak goal that derails what had been a fine playoff game to that point. Toronto's been waiting for one of its goaltenders to go on a classic playoff heater for what seems like a lifetime, and none of them, from Freddie Andersen to Jack Campbell to Samsonov, has managed it for any length of time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Leafs have been undone by everyone from Vezina types (Andrei Vasilevskiy) to cagey vets (Carey Price, Sergei Bobrovsky) to future journeymen (Joonas Korpisalo). Playoff history is littered with examples of series that turned on an unexpected goaltending performance. The Leafs, or at least this modern version of them, are still waiting for theirs.\n\nThe other thing that's familiar about all this is the caveats. It's early. The Leafs are only down 2-1. Even when the team struggled to get over various Boston- and Tampa-sized humps in recent seasons, it was always in the series and poised to turn things around if some of the vagaries of playoff hockey could just turn in its favor.\n\nThe same is true of this series. The return of William Nylander from his mystery injury, if it happens, could be just the grease to get Toronto's power-play wheels turning again. Samsonov could do that thing that goalies sometimes do and stand on his head. Maybe Joseph Woll will come in and do it. Maybe the lower bowl at Scotiabank Arena will be raucous and lively for Game 4 on Saturday, and the Bruins players will be intimated by playing in front of such a cauldron.\n\nOK, that last one probably won't happen, no matter what Joe Bowen wishes. But the Stanley Cup Playoffs are supposed to be about weird things taking place, about surprises and flukes. Perhaps the Maple Leafs just need some chaos. So far, the familiar script isn't working.", "source": {"uri": "thescore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theScore.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Doughty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Doughty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Kempe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Kempe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Vasilevskiy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrei Vasilevskiy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_Price", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carey Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joonas_Korpisalo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joonas Korpisalo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/626173/w768xh576_GettyImages-2149486926.jpg?ts=1714058056", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes it happens naturally when a goalie is on a roll and becomes unbeatable in the mind of the other team's players, think Jaroslav Halak during the Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins series in the spring of 2010. Other times, psychological warfare happens in the media where players try to steal the show with the quote of the day, think Patrick Roy after being provoked by Jeremy Roenick. Reporters told the Avalanche goaltender what Roenick had said about him:\n\nI'd like to know where Patrick was in Game 3, probably up trying to get his jock out of the rafters.\n\nRoy had just the right answer for the Blackhawks' center even though his English wasn't perfect back then:\n\nI cannot really hear what Jeremy says because I got my two Stanley Cup rings plugging my ear.\n\nTrash-talking is an art and it's never easy to strike the perfect balance, you want to unsettle the opponent, but you do not want to motivate them. Talk to former Quebec Nordiques' goalie coach Daniel Bouchard who, in the first round of the 1993 Playoffs and after Quebec had taken a 2-0 lead in the series, famously said he had found a flaw in Roy's game (from 'Winning and Nothing Else', Les \u00c9ditions Libre Expression, page 338, 2007). Quebec lost the next four games while the Canadiens would go on to win the franchise's 24 Stanley Cup. Bouchard shouldn't have poked the bear there...\n\nLast night in Boston's win over the Maple Leafs, Brad Marchand had a great game scoring two goals and adding an assist to his tally, but after scoring the Bruins' fourth goal into an empty net, he skated by the Maple Leafs' bench and declared while approaching the Bruins' bench:\n\nIt's going to be over in five!\n\nThis coupled with Marchand's offensive production in the game and his antics to get under the Maple Leafs' skin ensured the Bruins' captain got right into the Maple Leafs' heads.\n\nMarchand even managed to occupy a space in Sheldon Keefe's postgame presser. Toronto's bench boss couldn't get his mind around how the super pest can skate around and get away with so much. For him, Marchand's been in the league for so long that he not only gets the calls when something is done to him, but he's also perfected the art of getting away with what he does himself. There you have it, Marchand now lives in the Leafs' pilot's head rent-free.\n\nWho in the Maple Leafs' room will make a stand and use Marchand to motivate his team? Seeing the GIF of Marchand saying \"It will be over in five\" should be enough to light a fire under the Leafs. Now's the time for Toronto players to show they're not soft and can push back when provoked. The pushing back doesn't even have to be in kind, they can just jump on the ice for Game 4 and make Marchand eat his words.\n\nRelated: League Reprimanding Marchand: Click Bait or Lick Bait\n\nIn the playoffs, teams need to find a way to motivate themselves, winning the Stanley Cup should be enough, but sometimes they need extra motivation. Think about the Avalanche's Mission 16W in 2001, Colorado was on a mission to finally win a Stanley Cup for Ray Bourque. The defenseman had been in the league for 21 years without ever raising the hardest trophy to win in sports over his head. Not so long ago, in 2019, the St. Louis Blues won the Cup using Laila Anderson as their motivation. The 11-year-old girl was fighting for her life because of an auto-immune disease, and the Blues were her favourite team.

The Bruins captain helped set the tone in the third period to give the Black and Gold the one-game advantage in the best-of-seven first-round playoff series.\n\nYou would think the Bruins were riding high on the momentum a day after stealing home ice, but head coach Jim Montgomery told reporters Thursday that he's not a big believer in the concept. He noted Toronto should have had the momentum after its third period in Game 2, but the advantage was not clearly shown.\n\nNESN host and sideline reporter Adam Pellerin told NESN.com that the theme of \"gratitude\" is clear across the Bruins lineup. Players understand the position they are in and how huge the Original Six rivalry is. The feeling of being up 2-1 in the series obviously is great, but the players understand anything can happen in the playoffs. William Nylander reportedly could return in Game 4 on Saturday, so Boston will need to be ready for any obstacle in its path.\n\nThat feeling of \"gratitude\" was expressed by James van Riemsdyk before Game 3 on Wednesday. The veteran forward was a healthy scratch in the first two games of the series, but van Riemsdyk knew the team had to come first and understood you always have to be ready to step up when the postseason comes around.\n\nThe Bruins will continue with their \"stay-in-the-moment\" attitude with two days of rest in between Games 3 and 4.

Mitch Marner and Matthew Knies teamed up for a beautiful second-period goal, but the Leafs failed to generate an abundance of high-danger chances. Their special teams let them down yet again, and Auston Matthews failed to pick up a point for the second time in three games. William Nylander's continued absence was felt in the 4-2 loss, and the Leafs are once again desperate for a win ahead of Game 4 on Saturday night.\n\nKnies made a great pass to set up John Tavares for Toronto's best chance of the first period but was not rewarded on the scoresheet. However, it was only a matter of time, as he drove to the net and put home a great pass from Marner to open the scoring for the Leafs in the second.\n\nHe set up Marner for a great chance on his very next shift, but his linemate was unable to slide the puck through traffic.\n\nToronto's top power-play unit surrendered an early short-handed breakaway, and while Marner was only partially responsible, he deserves at least some of the blame for being a little bit too aggressive while being the last man back. However, Ilya Samsonov bailed him out, and Marner made an incredible play to set up Knies for the game's first goal. He played 23:06 and showed off his offensive skill set in a game where hardly anyone else could.\n\nTavares had Toronto's best chance of the first period but couldn't quite sneak the puck under the crossbar. His work in the neutral zone kicked off the sequence for Toronto's first goal, and it felt like he was winning puck battle after puck battle. He also set up Bertuzzi for an excellent chance on an early third-period power play, but his teammate failed to capitalize. His line was Toronto's best, but he did take a costly penalty in the final minutes.\n\nTheir minutes were largely uneventful, which is what Sheldon Keefe is looking for. Holmberg came close to setting up Reaves for a tap-in at the end of the second, and both Robertson and J\u00e4rnkrok had a decent chance late in the third. They were good, but not great.\n\nThe fourth line (Connor Dewar, David K\u00e4mpf and Ryan Reaves)\n\nThey played boring minutes and did their job effectively. Reaves played only 2:16 in the first, but he got the crowd fired up by throwing two heavy checks on Pavel Zacha. K\u00e4mpf made a nice pass to set up Dewar for a good chance halfway through the second but he couldn't beat Jeremy Swayman.\n\nJake McCabe\n\nMcCabe showed off his strong gap control at the end of the first to break up a rush from Marchand. The Bruins failed to generate much of anything during his minutes early but he was on for Jake DeBrusk's power-play goal in the early third.\n\nMorgan Rielly\n\nRielly's been fine thus far in this series, but not quite the playoff version of Rielly that we're used to. He picked up an assist and tied the game up by throwing the puck on net in the third but didn't create much of anything outside of that.\n\nBenoit took a puck-over-glass penalty 40 seconds in, but his team bailed him out. He then bounced back nicely by throwing a hard open-ice hit on David Pastrnak. He wasn't on for a goal against and largely did his job.\n\nIlya Lyubushkin\n\nLyubushkin was strong defensively in the first, but James van Riemsdyk got around him for a breakaway chance in the second. That was his only major mistake, as he wasn't on for a goal against.\n\nIlya Samsonov\n\nThe first five shots of the game went Boston's way, and Samsonov made a couple of big saves to weather the storm. Toronto's top power-play unit gave up a short-handed breakaway a handful of minutes later, but Samsonov once again found a way to keep the game tied.\n\nThe Leafs settled in defensively and gave him a bit of a breather, and he rewarded them with yet another huge breakaway stop in the second. However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, as Trent Frederic tied the game on a shot that Samsonov is expected to stop:\n\nDeBrusk then gave the Bruins the lead in the early third:\n\nTwenty-eight seconds after Tyler Bertuzzi tied it up, Marchand beat Samsonov with a perfect shot from the slot:\n\nEdmundson picked up a secondary assist on Knies' opening goal but was on for Boston's first three goals. He's a good player in the corners but really struggles to move the puck at times.\n\nAuston Matthews\n\nMatthews failed to generate much in the first but then hit the post one minute into the second. He drew a penalty to give the Leafs a power play in the early third, but his line got outplayed. He's held to a high standard and simply didn't come close to it in Game 3.\n\nTyler Bertuzzi\n\nBertuzzi failed to create much of anything offensively in the opening 40 minutes, and he took an unnecessary roughing penalty at the end of the second that resulted in a Bruins goal. He tied the game halfway through the third when Rielly's point shot deflected off his skate, but his line was on for a goal against less than 30 seconds later. The trio struggled.\n\nMax Domi\n\nDomi created a half-decent scoring chance for himself at the end of the first, but it was a quiet period for just about every offensive catalyst. He wasn't great in the second, as he had an iffy turnover that led to a pretty good chance the other way. He also had a front-row seat for Marchand's go-ahead goal in the third.\n\nTimothy Liljegren\n\nI wouldn't say that he played poorly, but I barely noticed him. Consider this an \"incomplete\" grade.\n\nThere's no such thing as a moral victory come playoff time, so you can consider every win to be an A+ and every loss to be an F. However, the Leafs deserve a C- for how they actually played. The opening 40 minutes were dull at five-on-five, as this was more of a defensive battle. Samsonov gave up a weak goal that allowed the Bruins to tie the game heading into the final frame, but he had also made a couple of breakaway stops earlier in the game. Ultimately, a low-scoring tie game heading into the third felt fair.\n\nThe Leafs had a chance to take control of the game on a late second-period power play, but Bertuzzi took an undisciplined penalty, and the man advantage soon turned into extra work for the penalty kill. Boston showed its special teams dominance over Toronto yet again, as DeBrusk scored on the resulting power play one minute into the third. The Leafs tied it halfway through the period when Rielly's point shot hit off a pair of skates and in, but Marchand responded less than 30 seconds later, and the Leafs couldn't recover.\n\nStaying at home for Game 4 on Saturday at 8 p.m. on Hockey Night in Canada.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_papetti@theathletic.com", "name": "Kevin Papetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakaway_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakaway (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_K\u00e4mpf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David K\u00e4mpf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Lyubushkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Lyubushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Zacha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Zacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_McCabe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake McCabe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_van_Riemsdyk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James van Riemsdyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Liljegren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Liljegren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Night_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Night in Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/24223740/USATSI_23105395-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

We will focus on money line bets, totals, and team totals. With all of that said, let's break down some hockey games. Follow me on Twitter/X @BKemp17.\n\nThe Bruins and Maple Leafs split the first two games of the series at the TD Garden in Boston, with the Bruins taking a 5-1 win in Game 1 before the Leafs evened it up with a tight 3-2 win on Monday.\n\nEven with a 5-1 win on Saturday, the Bruins were out-shot by a 36-25 margin as it has been the Leafs carrying much of the play. Entering Wednesday's Game 3, Toronto has a 57.30% of the expected goals in the series versus the Bruins at just 42.7%. They have controlled 65.79% of the high-danger chances and 68.6% of the overall scoring chances. The goals are 7-4 for the Bruins but the ice has been tilted in the Leafs' favor in this young series.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have done so without the help of William Nylander who has yet to appear in the series due to an undisclosed injury. However, Sheldon Keefe said his star winger is a possibility for Game 3 but a game-time decision is expected on this front.\n\nThe club has also out-played their rivals despite a lackluster effort from Mitch Marner. The Auston Matthews line has dominated and the bottom-six has played well but the Matthew Knies - John Tavares - Marner line hasn't had a great series so far at even strength. Expect that to change moving forward.\n\nDespite a tough Game 1, Ilya Samsonov bounced back with a stellar effort in Game 2. He has played with plenty of confidence since his early-season struggles.\n\nLook for the Maple Leafs to continue to carry the play while their superior star power should help steer them to a Game 3 win on home ice.\n\nPick: Maple Leafs moneyline (-112, DraftKings Sportsbook)\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights went into Dallas and took Game 1 from the Western Conference champs on Monday by a 4-3 count and will look to stun the Stars again to take a 2-0 series back to Sin City.\n\nIt's not going to be an easy task, however. The Stars probably deserved a better Game 1 fate as they earned 62.5% of the high-danger chances, 57.8% of the expected goals, and 56.41% of the overall scoring chances. It's just a one-game sample but it's clear the Stars deserved a better fate, even before mentioning they yielded just 15 (!) shots on goal versus the 28 they put on Vegas netminder Logan Thompson.\n\nOf course, this means Jake Oettinger needs to be much better than he was on Monday. The young netminder yielded four goals on those 15 shots (.733 save percentage). Despite some regression this regular season, the 25-year-old yielded two goals or less in each of his last four regular-season outings, posting a hearty .938 Sv% in that time. The Stars don't usually make things difficult on their goaltenders, allowing the seventh-fewest shots against in the regular season.\n\nAfter all, this Stars offense ranked third in the NHL with 3.59 goals per game on the season. They finished sixth and eighth in power play and on the penalty kill, respectively, as special teams have long been in their favor.\n\nIt's not difficult to see the club staying with it and putting together another quality effort while evening up the series on Wednesday.\n\nPick: Stars first 60 minutes (-110, DraftKings Sportsbook)", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brenton_kemp@rotoballer.com", "name": "Brenton Kemp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2022/02/auston-matthews-NHL-DFS-lineup-picks-daily-fantasy-hockey-icon-rotoballer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 792, "textEnd": 800}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

But he does.\"\n\nIn a fitting testament to his divisive reputation across hockey circles, the discourse surrounding Brad Marchand split into two different narratives on Wednesday night.\n\nThe difference between those accounts? Well, whichever team was speaking into the microphone.\n\nFor Marchand's teammates in black-and-gold sweaters, it was their captain's two-goal salvo in the third period and his knack for dragging them into the fight that was the focus of their praise.\n\n\"That's our leader, and he's a captain through and through,\" Jeremy Swayman said postgame after Boston's 4-2 win in Game 3 against Toronto. \"He doesn't take no for an answer. Leads by example, he's just a pinnacle of what a captain should be. And we're so lucky to have him in this room.\"\n\nMaple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe also offered praise for Marchand -- albeit through more of a backhanded approach.\n\n\"World-class player, both in ability and how he plays -- the gamesmanship and everything,\" Keefe noted. \"It's world-class. He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. You've got to play through that. You've got to play through that stuff.\n\n\"I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out (Tyler) Bertuzzi's legs the way he does. There's not another player in this series that gets away with that. But he does. It's an art. He's elite at it.\"\n\nMarchand serves as both the emotional conduit for Boston and an impactful top-six stalwart. But the 35-year-old veteran is still one of the best in the league at serving as the fly in the ointment against the opposition.\n\nAnd with his team in need of a lift, Marchand delivered a vintage performance as hockey's best heel in Boston's key road win at Scotiabank Arena.\n\n\"I've seen it for my whole career,\" Jake DeBrusk said of Marchand's performance. \"He's a guy that scores in very different ways. Some of 'em are greasy and some of 'em are snipes. But I feel like the games where he plays the best is when there's a little bit of a cluster going on around him during the game or sometimes maybe before or after. I think that when he gets in his 'Little Ball of Hate' mode, that's usually when good things happen for this team.\"\n\nMarchand's ascension from fourth-line scrapper to elite winger was put on display Wednesday. After delivering the primary helper on Jake DeBrusk's power-play goal at 1:07 in the third period, he gave Boston the lead for good nearly 11 minutes later.\n\nJust 28 seconds after Bertuzzi lit the lamp and knotted the game up at 2-2, Marchand snapped a puck over Ilya Samsonov's shoulder to put his team ahead.\n\nHe also added the empty-netter for good measure, toppling over his former teammate in Bertuzzi during a board battle before depositing the puck into twine with 36 seconds remaining on the clock.\n\nAlong with his three-point performance, Marchand landed six shots on goal over his 18:39 of ice time -- with 4:14 of those reps on a penalty-kill unit that went 5-for-5 against Toronto's high-powered offense.\n\nBoston managed to tilt the ice in its favor whenever Marchand hopped over the boards, with the Bruins holding a 2-0 edge in goals scored and a 19-5 advantage in shot attempts over his 11:52 of 5-on-5 reps.\n\n\"I just think there's a burning intensity in him to win,\" Jim Montgomery said of Marchand. \"And he doesn't care about what just happened. Good or bad. It's gone. He's on to what's next.\"\n\nBut Marchand impacted Wednesday's win well beyond what can be measured on the scoresheet. He didn't get a helper on the play, but Marchand's extended second-period tussle with Bertuzzi set the stage for Trent Frederic's tally just seconds later.\n\nKeefe's pointed postgame comments regarding Marchand revolved around that sequence, with Marchand not whistled for anything as Bertuzzi dropped to the ice.\n\nClearly, Marchand's antics have started to wear on Boston's first-round foe.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin and influence the refs, so I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that [expletive],\" Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies said of Marchand, per Chris Johnston of The Athletic. \"Just play hard and make him (less) effective.\"\n\nMarchand may not be the same player who used Daniel Sedin's face as a speedbag during the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. But the Bruins captain still knows how to get an opponent's blood boiling when the opportunity arises.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Keefe and the Maple Leafs could only sit and stew as Marchand put his team ahead in their best-of-seven series.\n\n\"Burt and I get tied up one shift. But outside of that, I mean, I'm not really in the mix with anything,\" Marchand said postgame. \"I'm just trying to play and play a good team game. At this time of the year, it gets all emotional. And I'm an emotional player.\n\n\"We have a lot of emotional players on our team. And you need to be able to keep that intact. I thought we've done a really good job with that so far as a team. We're playing hard between the whistles and not getting emotional -- we're not going over that line, so just got to continue that.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sedin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sedin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_LEE42244bruinsmaple18SPTS-662a1660f377a-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

It requires grit and dedication. Under Kyle Dubas, the Maple Leafs assembled a team that oozes talent but lacks character and physicality. Last season, Toronto was finally able to get out of the first round, beating the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games after falling at the first hurdle time and time again. The Maple Leafs hadn't won a series before last year's triumph over the Bolts since 2004, just short of 20 years.\n\nHowever, in the second round, the Leafs found the Florida Panthers in their way, and it was a talented yet physical player who was the main architect of their demise. In the first game alone, Matthew Tkachuk gathered three assists and ended the series with five points in five games. When he wasn't putting points up, he was creating havoc all over the ice and making the Leafs players suffer for every inch of ice. It took five games for the Cats to send the Leafs home and start their once again too-long off-season.\n\nLess than a week after elimination, Brendan Shanahan fired Dubas and replaced him with Brad Treliving shortly thereafter. The former Calgary Flames general manager took the helm in Toronto and raised a few eyebrows when he went out to sign a 36-year-old free agent and enforcer to a three-year contract no less. While no one can argue that Ryan Reaves isn't tough, with all due respect to the player, he lacks the skills and talent that make Matthew Tkachuk such a tough opponent.\n\nThe next day Treliving gave a one-year deal to the son of former enforcer Tie Domi, Max Domi and another one to Tyler Bertuzzi. The youngest Domi is no Matthew Tkachuk either, but those are rarely available in free agency. Unlike Reaves who only managed to get 20 points in his best career year, Domi's got an offensive upside. It was only four years ago that he put up 72 points with the Leafs' biggest rival, the Montreal Canadiens. Since then, he has played with four different teams and just couldn't manage as productive a season. But you do not get 72 points in a season out of luck.\n\nIn Toronto though, Domi got to play with much more talented players than he ever did in his career and put up 47 points this season. Now that the stakes are higher, he must channel his inner pest and play smartly. It's a well-known fact that referees tend to put their whistles away come playoff season, but there is a line you cannot cross. If an infraction is too obvious, it will be called, and you will become a liability for your team.\n\nIn Game 1, Domi received two minor penalties, the second of which was particularly costly as the Bruins scored a power-play goal while he was in the box. It was a slashing on Brad Marchand that bought him a round-trip to the sin bin. Marchand is known around the league as a player who likes to get under everyone's skin and as such, the refs are keeping a very close eye on him. If you bite when he gets to you, you won't be pleased with the consequences, it's all about playing smarter than that. Domi has been known for losing it in the past, like when he sucker-punched Aaron Ekblad in his Montreal Canadiens' debut.\n\nIn short, Domi has got to keep his temper in check and make the most of the great opportunity he's been given. Right now, he rides shotgun on Auston Matthews' line and could do some serious damage if he doesn't lose his focus. Furthermore, he's also centering the second wave of the power play.\n\nConsidering Domi will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason, this is a golden opportunity to show what he can do. He might not get another offer from the Maple Leafs unless it's another one-year pact since money is likely to get even tighter in Toronto at the end of next season. Mitch Marner will be looking for a raise and John Tavares' contract will also be up. It remains to be seen if the Leafs will want to extend their captain, but there needs to be some cap room available when Matthew Knies and Nicholas Robertson finish their entry-level contract.\n\nRelated: Max Domi's Resurgence with Maple Leafs Could Lead to Extension\n\nWith the series now tied at one game a piece and moving to Toronto, Sheldon Keefe's men must get in the driver's seat. They've managed to win an away game, and if they can be strong at home and prevent the Bruins from getting home-ice advantage back, it would go a long way towards winning a playoff series for a second year in a row.\n\nFurthermore, the Leafs may be able to get some reinforcement. Keefe mentioned on Tuesday that he had no update on William Nylander, but the head coach added he could be a possibility for Wednesday's game. Should he be ready to go, chances are Ryan Reaves would make way which would be good news for Toronto's attack.\n\nAs for the Bruins, they'll be without defenseman Andrew Peeke who they acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets on trade deadline day. Peeke is considered week-to-week meaning Jim Montgomery will have to test the depth of his defense corps which doesn't worry him as he considers it a position of strength for his team.\n\nWe'll know soon enough how deep Boston's defense corps is and which version of Max Domi will show up for Game 3. The one who gets baited into taking bad penalties, or the smarter one who keeps his focus and zeros in on the task at hand?", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Leafs have listed Nylander out of the first three games of their first-round series against the Boston Bruins with an \"undisclosed\" injury, including ahead of Game 3 on April 24, per NHL.com.\n\nNylander's \"undisclosed\" injury and availability (or the lack of it) is surprising because the Leafs forward didn't miss a single game throughout the regular season, including playing the finale among all 82 outings he was part of. He scored 40 goals and assisted 58 for a total of 98 points this year.\n\nOnce the postseason got rolling, however, Nylander hit the injury report and missed Game 1 and Game 2 in Boston followed by another absence in the Leafs' first game home on April 24 when they hosted the Bruins in Game 3. Toronto trails Boston 2-1 following Wednesday's outcome.\n\nNylander took part in Toronto's morning skate on Sunday, April 21, ahead of Game 2.\n\nThe Athletic's Chris Johnston reported on April 24 that Nylander was, in fact, part of the team's practice hours before puck drop for Game 3 later on Wednesday. He captured the Leafs winger on the ice.\n\nKristen Shilton of ESPN shared a similar report. She confirmed on Wednesday, ahead of Game 3, that Nylander was in fact on the rink practicing on Wednesday morning. She also added that he performed extra drills after the main session was over.\n\n\"Nylander had been on the ice at least twice before Wednesday's workout but stayed mostly on the perimeter doing his own work,\" Shilton wrote. \"Once the main portion of Wednesday's session concluded, Nylander performed extra drills with the Leafs' projected scratches.\"\n\nWith Nylander out of action for the first three games of the playoffs, Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe has used rookie Nicholas Robertson as his replacement and in Toronto's third forward line, per Daily Faceoff.\n\nThe absence of Nylander, however, is a bit of a distraction if only because of all of the content and questions related to it that are asked to the Leafs staff daily.\n\nSportsnet's Elliotte Friedman recorded an episode of his \"32 Thoughts\" podcast before Game 3 saying there was a \"decent shot\" Nylander could play. Didn't happen.\n\nThat, however, was not the main point of the discussion. It was, rather, the secrecy about Nylander's injury and how Toronto is managing the situation.\n\nWith little clarity about what's affecting Nylander's availability and his injury termed \"undisclosed,\" speculation has started to grow a bit too big of late.\n\nFriedman said that he understands Toronto's handling of the situation as they don't want to reveal their cards. Friedman also said that he doesn't believe the rumor about the Leafs having suspended Nylander for disciplinary reasons.\n\n\"This Nylander thing is weird,\" Friedman said on the April 22 episode of his podcast. \"I have theories, but I just don't believe at this time of the year you should guess on injuries unless you absolutely know one-billion-percent know what they are.\"\n\nFriedman also said that Nylander didn't show any signs of having suffered an injury through the end of the regular season while the Leafs never released any official update on his status.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_losada@heavy.com", "name": "Antonio Losada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliotte_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliotte Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147411812-e1714031366353.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 117, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 387, "textEnd": 395}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1327, "textEnd": 1335}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 3218, "textEnd": 3226}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He was belligerent, clutch and smart but still a pest. Marchand was in control while pushing the Maple Leafs out of control. He's figured out how to listen to the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other and combine their messages effectively.\n\n\"There's a burning intensity in him to win,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said.\n\nThat fire was already well stoked hours before Wednesday's 4-2 Game 3 victory. Moments into morning skate, he was already shouting to his teammates spurring them to do more and be more.\n\n\"He started barking the first drill,\" Montgomery said. \"I loved it.\"\n\nAfter the early session, Marchand reminded his teammates to cherish being in the postseason.\n\n\"It's not a given that you get to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs. I woke up with that gratitude. It's a gift to play in this league,\" Marchand said. \"It's something we dream about as kids. I talk to my kids about it and their dreams of playing at this level. To realize we're living it, We're lucky to be here. You want to make the most of this opportunity.\"\n\nThe message landed.\n\n\"I love what he said about gratitude. These series go fast. You've got to work for them,\" Charlie McAvoy said. \"Emotionally, he's our leader and he drags us into the fight every night. It's on us to follow right behind him.\"\n\nDragging them into the fight can take different forms on different nights. On Wednesday it meant getting under the skin of a former teammate.\n\nMarchand had tangled with Tyler Bertuzzi when Bertuzzi was on the Red Wings. But when the Bruins traded for him at the 2023 deadline, he and Marchand became friends, united by similar interests off the ice and similar hard-to-play-against styles on it during their brief stint as teammates. But they've put that on pause for the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThey traded shoves, slashes and cross-checks while chirping each other in the second period. Their pest polka had the crowd's attention and even seemed to distract Ilya Samsonov, who gave up a weak goal to Trent Frederic moments later. The play tied the score and might have changed the game.\n\n\"When he gets in his \"Little Ball of Hate\" mode good things happen for the team,\" Jake DeBrusk said. \"He plays to his strengths and sometimes his strengths are getting in the face of opponents and being annoying and someone you wouldn't want to play against.\"\n\nWhile Leafs play-by-play voice Joe Bowen repeatedly called Marchand \"a rat\" or \"the rat\" during the broadcast, the Bruins captain reminded everyone watching how skilled he actually is. He came out of a battle on the right wing boards with the puck and launched it at the next. Samsonov saved it but DeBrusk put home the rebound to put the Bruins ahead.\n\nJust 28 seconds after Bertuzzi tied the game, Marchand laser-beamed a wrist shot over Samsonov's shoulder to put the Bruins ahead again with 8:07 left.\n\n\"This time of year it gets so emotional. I'm an emotional player,\" he said. \"You need to be able to keep that intact.\"\n\nMarchand sealed the game with an empty netter late.\n\n\"He's always risen to big moments,\" Montgomery said. \"You look at his career points in the playoffs.\"\n\nHis 134 postseason points are second only to Ray Bourque. His 12 game-winning goals in the playoffs are second to nobody.\n\n\"That was vintage March,\" DeBrusk said. \"He was our leader tonight. We needed him and he came through.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pest (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bourque", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Bourque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_net_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empty net goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrist shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/3FLTUPZ6PJA5ZGP4MWO7J3NYUM.jpeg?auth=1fd58a48130b8570905827e85ac408c3d945fc19d1af454284a56e3085cc452d&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Jake DeBrusk connected for his third PPG of the season, and Brad Marchand scored his second of the game on the advantage, sweeping the puck into an empty net for the 4-2 final.\n\n\"I don't know, you guys are the analysts,\" DeBrusk said postgame, asked what has turned the club's man-advantage into a powerhouse. \"As a net-front guy, I just kinda try to find spots to be open. I think sometimes it just takes one to fall. But at the same time, in the waves and flow of the season -- I think it happens to every group, even the best power plays in the league can struggle for a month and then it finds its tune.\n\nThe power play had been a dog's breakfast over the final three weeks of the regular season. Once a strength, it had become a giant, troubling soft spot.\n\nNow three games into the postseason, the Bruins are blistering on the advantage, and three of those goals belong to DeBrusk. He scored a pair in Game 1.\n\nSome other observations:\n\n\u25aa Trent Frederic's tying goal, 1-1, had to be a huge letdown for the Leafs. They had been generating traction in the offensive end after Matthew Knies provided the Leafs a 1-0 lead at 11:10.\n\nMomentum was on the Blue & White's side ... until Ilya Samsonov failed to close off the short side on Frederic's shot from near the dot in the left wing circle. The cardinal sin in goaltending: giving up short-side goals.\n\n\u25aa Following the Leafs' morning workout, Mitch Marner talked about the need to watch out for passes to the weak side by the Bruins whenever David Pastrnak was on the ice.\n\n\"They make you pay if you give them odd-man rushes,\" he said, \"and they're constantly sending a guy wide [to the back door].\"\n\nAnd it was the slick Marner who set up Knies for the first goal of the night, taking advantage of loose coverage in the defensive end by the Bruins. Knies rushed to the backside (left post) with Parker Wotherspoon and Kevin Shattenkirk the back liners, and Marner delivered the perfect pass for his linemate to snap high on Jeremy Swayman.\n\n\u25aa The first two games of the series included a surprising amount of contact between the sides. They combined for 93 hits (Leafs, 52-41) in the series opener. Two nights later, the Bruins held a 52-45 edge. Two games, 190 hits.\n\nThat's heavy work, especially for teams that prioritize skill over contract.\n\n\"Fatigue's certainly a factor -- it's difficult to sustain that,\" said Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe, acknowledging that hitting tends to back off as a series plays out. \"It's why you don't see that level in the regular season, because you know you've got to play again and again and again. It's why, in a lot of cases, the first round is the most physical -- because everyone's fresh and on a pretty even playing field.\n\n\"That said, I don't see it changing in this series any time soon.\"\n\nThe theme didn't change in the first period. They combined for 60 hits, with the Bruins holding a 32-28 edge. Jake DeBrusk, not known for his physical play, led both sides with five smacks.\n\n\"Well, guys get tired, right?\" added Bruins coach Jim Montgomery, pondering prior to puck drop why the hitting normally diminishes as a series broadens. \"I think that's why. What are we, the third game in five nights? But you might see it come back here because we've got two days off.\n\nMontgomery was right. By early in the third period, the sides had amassed over 100 hits.\n\n\u25aa After being scratched in the first two games, James van Riemsdyk drew back in for the Bruins, mainly because Montgomery hoped his net-front skills could help on the power play.\n\nJVR, who spent six seasons with the Leafs (2012-18), has benefited from NHL rule changes through the years that penalize some of the vicious cross-checks defensemen routinely used to move forwards away from the net front.\n\n\"Yeah, the hardest part in my career at front,\" mused van Riemsdyk, thinking back to his early years with the Flyers, \"was in practice with Chris Pronger, my rookie year.\"\n\nPronger, the towering back liner, was known for his trademark cross-checks, often with opposing forwards sent crashing to the ice.\n\n\"It's definitely a little different now,\" noted JVR. \"And obviously, there are some things that come with it that, as a player, you had to adjust to.

Just seconds after the Leafs had tied the game, Marchand sniped a shortside shot over Ilya Samsonov's glove to make it 3-2 They held up for the game-winner in the 4-2 win, leading to a 2-1 series lead over the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nWith the B's trying to kill a 6-on-5 situation, John Tavares took a holding penalty with 1:04 remaining.\n\nWhen the Leafs took control of the puck, they pulled Samsonov again, but Machand put the nail in the coffin with empty-netter with 35.8 left.\n\nJeremy Swayman was pretty good, too, turning away 28 of 30 shots for his fifth win against the Leafs this season.\n\nThe scoreless first period was an entertaining one nonetheless, with both teams having a couple of decent chances in the hard-hitting opening 20 minutes (the B's held a 32-28 hit edge, according to the local stat crew).\n\nThe B's got the first break of the night when Simon Benoit shot the puck into the stands on the first shift of the game, but the B's could not capitalize on the advantage.\n\nShortly after the B's power play was up, rookie Mason Lohrei, in his first Stanley Cup playoff game, got tagged with a crosschecking penalty in front of the net on Tyler Bertuzzi. The B's killed that off well and had the best chance of the two minutes, a clean breakaway for Pavel Zacha that Ilya Samsonov just got a piece, the puck dribbling just wide.\n\nThe B's had a great 5-on-5 chance when Charlie McAvoy took the puck behind the net and his wraparound attempt went out to David Pastrnak on the right side. Samsonov was out of the net, but Joel Edmundson stepped in for a goal-saving block.\n\nThe Leafs best chance came when Parker Wotherspoon, also playing his first Cup playoff game, was double-teamed behind the net by Bertuzzi and Max Domi, who stepped out from behind the net for an open shot, but Jeremy Swayman gave him little at which to shoot and gobbled it up.\n\nWhile the B's had the hit advantage on the stat sheet, the Leafs delivered a couple of thunderous checks late in the period that had the crowd roaring. First Benoit blasted Pastrnak just inside he Leafs blue line, then Ryan Reaves crushed Zacha with a clean check in the neutral zone.\n\nAuston Matthews had a couple of good opportunities early in the second period. The first one came when Lohrei stepped up in the neutral zone, couldn't get the puck and gave the Leafs a 2-on-1. Matthews kept it and pinged the far post.\n\nHis second chance came on a power play with Pastrnak in the box for hooking on a back-check. Swayman stoned him on a wide-open shot from the right circle.\n\nBut the Leafs finally broke the ice at 13:10. After Pastrnak had a shot blocked, it produced a big rebound and a 3-on-2 for the Leafs. Matthew Knies finished off the play, tapping home Mitch Marner's pretty pass for the 1-0 lead.\n\nThe B's hadn''t been getting many chances in the second, but shortly after the goal, James van Riemsdyk had a breakaway. Making his first appearance in the series, van Riemsdyk tried to tuck it between Samsonov's pads but the netminder closed them in time.\n\nThen the refs put the whistles away, to the B's benefit. First, McAvoy slammed Matthews to the ice behind the B's net, no call.\n\nThen Brad Marchand and Bertuzzi were battling each other in the middle of the ice, a gloves-on scrap that that had the attention of the entire crowd. Samsonov must have had one eye on it, too, because as the tiff was going on the crowd was screaming for the refs to something, anything, Trent Frederic beat the netminder with a long-range shot from the left wing with 2:23 remaining in the period.\n\nThe locals were not happy.\n\nShortly after that, with the crowd still in an uproar, the refs called a makeup rouging penalty on McAvoy. But even then, the Leafs couldn't take advantage as Bertuzzi wiped it out with a high-stick on Charlie Coyle.\n\nThat would give the B's a power play to start the second and the B's took their first lead of the game at 1:07. Marchand came out of a pileup on the riihgt boards with the puck and got a shot on net that Samsonov stopped. But with three Leafs still over at the boards, Jake DeBrusk had time to gather the rebound and score his third goal of the series.\n\nThe Leafs got a second cheapo call when Lohrei was whistled for hooking Matthews on what looked like a clean check. On the kill, Swayman made two huge saves on Bertuzzi right off the at the bat the B's killed it off.\n\nBut they could not hold the lead as the Leafs tied it on pinball with 8:35 remaining in the thirdwhen Morgan Rielly's shot went off Bertuzzi's skate, then Hampus Lindholm's shin and in.\n\nJust 18 seconds later, the B's captain gave his team the lead again, sniping a shot fomr the right circlle for the 3-2 lead.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_conroy@bostonherald.com", "name": "Steve Conroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakaway_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakaway (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Zacha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Zacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_van_Riemsdyk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James van Riemsdyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edmundson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edmundson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Herald_BridgePhoto.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

As in no penalty minutes through three games.\n\nGiven Marchand's reputation and insistence on being in the battle, Keefe believes that number is incomprehensible.\n\n\"World-class player, both in ability and how he plays -- the gamesmanship and everything,\" the Leafs coach said. \"It's world-class. He's been in the league long enough. As you can see, he gets calls. It's unbelievable, actually, how it goes. You've got to play through that. You've got to play through that stuff. I don't think there's another player in this series that gets away with taking out (Tyler) Bertuzzi's legs the way he does. There's not another player in this series that gets away with that. But he does. It's an art. He's elite at it.\"\n\nIn the second period, just about everybody in Scotiabank Arena was watching how Marchand and Bertuzzi, former teammates and friends, jousted and jabbed and slashed their way up and down the ice. Ilya Samsonov might have been among them. Otherwise, there is no explanation as to how the Toronto goalie muffed a Trent Frederic shot from outside the left-side dot, making it a 1-1 game.\n\nMarchand has made a career out of getting people's attention.\n\n\"He wants to get under our skin and influence the refs,\" Matthew Knies told reporters. \"So I think we've just got to be composed and not kind of get into that bull -- -. Just play hard and make him (less) effective.\"\n\nIt will not serve the Leafs well to keep Marchand's emotions firing. He thrives on conflict. It makes him a better player and leader. Marchand loves it when the temperature spikes.\n\n\"The games for him when he plays the best is when there's a cluster going on around him during the game,\" said Jake DeBrusk. \"Sometimes even before or after. When he gets into his 'little ball of hate' mode, usually good things happen for the team.\"\n\nIn Marchand's opinion, his second-period tangle with Bertuzzi was the only time he might have approached a disciplinary line. Otherwise, the captain has tried to keep his nose clean. By now, he knows he cannot afford to lose his cool.\n\n\"Bert and I get tied up one shift,\" said Marchand. \"But outside of that, I'm not really in the mix with anything. I'm just trying to play, and play a good team game. At this time of the year, it gets so emotional. I'm an emotional player.\"\n\nMarchand's juices started pumping early. At the Bruins' morning skate, coach Jim Montgomery noticed how Marchand was barking before the team's first drill.\n\n\"Just excited,\" Marchand said of his morning arrival. \"It's not a given that you get the opportunity in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Just kind of woke up with the gratitude and understanding that it's a gift to play in this league.\"\n\nMarchand's showdown with Bertuzzi, and Frederic's goal, elevated the Bruins. He saved his best for last.\n\nEarly in the third, while Bertuzzi was in the box for roughing, Marchand did the dirty work to produce the go-ahead goal. Marchand pulled the puck off the right-side wall and walked it toward the net. Samsonov got his glove on Marchand's shot. But DeBrusk was there to put in the rebound and give the Bruins a 2-1 lead.\n\nBertuzzi tied the game midway through the third when he deflected Morgan Rielly's slap pass past Jeremy Swayman. But 28 seconds later, Marchand punched back.\n\nWith the home crowd roaring after Bertuzzi's goal, Frederic and Danton Heinen went to work down low on the forecheck. Heinen came out with the puck. Marchand floated to the right faceoff dot. When Heinen emerged from the battle and looked up, Marchand was open in front. The captain rifled a riser over Samsonov's glove to give the Bruins a 3-2 lead.\n\n\"Every way possible,\" Charlie Coyle said of how Marchand set the Game 3 tone. \"His play? Yeah, that's one, him chipping in scoring-wise. But battling, just not backing down. His leadership on the bench, too. The way he talks and the way he keeps us engaged in what we need to do in that given situation whenever it calls for, he's always on top of that. So it goes beyond his play on the ice, which was exceptional tonight.\"\n\nMarchand ended the night with an empty-net goal. It gave him 56 career playoff goals, putting him past Cam Neely for the franchise lead.\n\n\"Hopefully, there's plenty more in the tank,\" said Marchand. \"But to be in the company with a guy like that, who's one of the most gifted goal-scorers in the history of our franchise and the game, is pretty special.\"\n\nKeefe's critique, cloaked in praise, could convince Game 4's officials to keep close watch on Marchand. The captain will not mind. He enjoys being in the middle of it.\n\n\"There's a burning intensity in him to win,\" Montgomery said. \"He doesn't care about what just happened. Good or bad. He's on to what's next.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fluto_shinzawa@theathletic.com", "name": "Fluto Shinzawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Knies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Knies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_DeBrusk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake DeBrusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Neely", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Neely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danton_Heinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danton Heinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/24233827/GettyImages-2149466216-scaled-e1714016336407.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

They were terrific,\" he added.\n\nNow down 2-1 in the best-of-seven series to Boston, the Leafs will need all encouragement they can get from fans when they return to Scotiabank Arena this Saturday for Game 4.\n\nLeafs 2024 first-round playoff schedule\n\n*if necessary", "source": {"uri": "dailyhive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailyhive.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_sciola@dailyhive.com", "name": "Al Sciola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20231012155901/leafs-bowen-radio-call-500x258.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

But in Wednesday night's Game 3, we saw the war of words add some chippiness.\n\nLate in the second period at Scotiabank Arena, Bertuzzi and Marchand engaged in a slashing battle that saw both forwards take turns tumbling to the ice near Toronto's blue line. The skirmish opened a clear path for Trent Frederic, who skated in alone and beat Ilya Samsonov's stick side for a game-tying goal.\n\nThe tally lit a spark for the Bruins, who went on to win 4-2 and take a 2-1 series lead. But after the game, Bertuzzi dumbed down Marchand's impact on the game-changing sequence.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, that stuff is going to happen with anyone,\" Bertuzzi told reporters, per a team-provided video. \"So, it's just normal.\"\n\nThe hard-nosed left wing, who spent the second half of last season in Boston, also knows what to expect from Marchand moving forward.\n\n\"I mean, he's a great player. It's what he does,\" Bertuzzi told reporters. \"He's been doing it for a long time. So, I don't expect it to stop.\"\n\nSheldon Keefe was far more unsettled by what went down before Frederic's goal. The Maple Leafs head coach thought Marchand should have been penalized for \"taking out Bertuzzi's legs\" as \"not one other player in this series\" would've made it out of the sequence without punishment from referees.\n\nToronto's composure will be tested Saturday night when it tries to avoid going on the brink of elimination in its own building.

Join Aaron Korolnek and Carlo Colaiacovo this week as they highlight a same game parlay for Game 3 between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins.\n\nAaron Korolnek: Game three Leafs-Bruins tonight. And Carlo, we have cooked up a Same Game Parlay. Why don't you take it away with a play on the under of six-and-a-half goals in an alternate total?\n\nCarlo Colaiacovo: Yeah, we. We just missed our Same Game Parlay last game, but it's playoff time. We're back at the grind. And so FanDuel's offering the total at five-and-a-half, but in the Same Game Parlay, you can bump it up to six-and-a-half. In this game, if you look at the first two games, neither game has gotten over six.\n\nAnd now that we're in the third game, it's the return of Jeremy Swayman. Who's had a lot of success against the Maple Leafs this year, 4-0 with a .962 save percentage. And I expect this game to be even more tightly contested, especially with the elevated play of Samsonov.\n\nNylander is still in question. Does he return? My gut says he does return, but that shouldn't change the fact that this game will be evenly matched. It'll be a close game and I like it to stay under the total of six-and-a-half.\n\nKorolnek: A leg in any parlay involving the Leafs and the Bruins has to include Auston Matthews five plus shots on goal.\n\nHad five in game one on 10 shot attempts, eight in game two on 12 shot attempts. The man is simply a menace. Putting pucks on net.\n\nCarlo, what's the final leg?\n\nColaiacovo: Well, why don't we go to his line mate? And that's Tyler Bertuzzi with the shots on goal.\n\nBecause guess what? He doesn't have to worry about feeding Matthews for 70. And he's definitely picked up his shot mentality in the last two games. Recording five last game, got a goal called back against him.\n\nYou look at the Maple Leafs, they've been very successful getting shots on that. They've got 70 shots on that in the last two games.\n\nYou got to expect the energy is going to carry them forward. Want to be more aggressive at getting shots on it, especially on Swayman, who has had that success that we talked about.\n\nSo Bertuzzi to record three-or-more shots is something that we're closing this Same Game Parlay with.\n\nKorolnek: I love it. So we've got the Leafs and the Bruins on an alternate total under six-and-a-half goals. Matthews five plus shots on net, and his linemate Tyler Bertuzzi as well.

On Monday night, centre Auston Matthews plucked a puck out of the air, stick handled to the right, quickly pulled to the left and snapped a shot into the net to lead the team past the Boston Bruins for the first win of the post-season.\n\nNow, the Leafs are back in Toronto to continue the first round series against the Bruins, which is tied at one win a piece. The Leafs will face off against the Bruins at 7 p.m. at Scotiabank Arena, with tailgate parties for fans outside in Maple Leaf Square.

But after the team added superstar Auston Matthews in 2016, she got excited.\n\n\"I think we have what it takes to get the job done,\" she said of this year's squad.\n\nHamilton-native Rob Luscombe said while he's excited for the game tonight, he tries not to let the Leafs dictate his emotions as much as the team used to.\n\n\"I remember watching playoff games and stupid stuff would happen...you get mad and angry and yell at the TV,\" he said, adding that his outlook changed as he got older.\n\n\"I don't want my kids to see that and become like that, right?\"\n\nGrowing up in the '80s, his own childhood recollections of the Leafs aren't great.\n\n\"Some of my very first memories as a Leafs fan [are] watching them get crushed every weekend as a kid,\" he said.\n\nScotiabank Arena organist Jimmy Holmstrom tries to pump up the crowd through tunes that make them clap or stomp. (Haydn Watters/CBC)\n\nPerched above the ice, there's one fan who also plays a role in making sure other fans keep the energy high in the arena: the organist Jimmy Holmstrom.\n\nInstead of shouting or cheering, his reactions to what's happening on the ice come in musical form.\n\n\"If it's a goal, I've got to respond.

Elliotte Friedman is one hockey analyst who has been critical of how the organization has handled the situation. He believes the team could have been more transparent in how it released the news - -- or, more accurately, failed to release it -- than it has been. As a result, fans and analysts alike have been left puzzled and increasingly frustrated.\n\nHere's what we know: Nylander, one of the Maple Leafs' key offensive forces, missed Games 1 and 2 against the Boston Bruins. Before each game, he was listed as a game-time decision, suggesting he might be close to returning. Because his performance throughout the regular season was spectacular, his absence left a hole in the team's ability to function on offense fully. His 40 goals and 98 points were missed in both round-one games thus far. Interestingly, unlike his teammates Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner, he never missed a game all season, playing in all 82 games.\n\nThere has been speculation about the situation. Despite what seems near readiness, the Maple Leafs' lack of clear communication has fuelled this speculation. Is it an injury, or is there a disciplinary issue at play? The team's silence has only magnified the rumors. They've neither confirmed nor denied specifics about his status.\n\nRelated: Maple Leafs Adjust Strategy Without Nylander\n\nMaple Leafs fans are understandably anxious and confused, and some are disappointed. Nylander's presence on the ice can help the Maple Leafs tip the game's dynamics in their favor. Every game without him is a missed chance to push the team further into the postseason. And, in the tight race of this playoff series wih the Bruins, every game counts.\n\nIn a recent episode of \"32 Thoughts,\" Sportsnet's co-hosts Friedman and Jeff Marek discussed how the Maple Leafs handled Nylander's situation. Both highlighted concerns over the team's communication strategy. According to Friedman, barring any setbacks, there's a \"decent shot\" Nylander could return for Game 3. This news offers a glimmer of hope but also raises questions about what could hold him back if he's physically ready to play.\n\nOn the one hand, Friedman said he understood why the team is keeping things quiet. Their tight lips could be seen as a strategic move to keep their cards close to their chest. However, this approach might also be a double-edged sword, potentially creating unnecessary distractions and unrest among the team and its supporters.\n\nIn the video above, Friedman and Marek discussed how the Nylander issue has emerged and what it means. Friedman was clear that the Maple Leafs' handling of the situation hasn't worked. There's a lot of secrecy, and while he understands that playoff gamesmanship is part of the sport, in this case, it has led to unnecessary angst. As noted, people now suggest Nylander might be suspended for disciplinary reasons, which Friedman doesn't believe is the case.\n\nRelated: NHL Rumors: Ducks, Maple Leafs, Blues, Canadiens\n\nMarek responded that the rumour mill goes into overdrive when you leave room for speculation. Other teams, like the Colorado Avalanche, have managed similar situations by being slightly more open about player statuses. They noted that Gabriel Landeskog is still recovering, which sets a clear expectation.\n\nAs Friedman noted, the issue is that by not being straightforward from the outset, the Maple Leafs allowed this situation to blow up into something bigger than it needed to be. It's not just about the nature of the injury or availability -- it's about managing the narrative.\n\nFriedman and Marek agreed that team strategies are important and that not everything needs to be disclosed. However, they also believe there's a balance. If an organization is too secretive, it creates more questions and distractions for its own team. Instead of focusing on the playoffs, we're here discussing whether Nylander is in trouble with the team.\n\nFriedman and Marek also agreed that there are challenges in maintaining team secrecy while balancing the need for transparency in certain situations. This is particularly true regarding player injuries and status updates. Friedman noted that, after the regular-season finale, there were indications Nylander was not feeling right. However, the Maple Leafs provided no official updates. This lack of information, according to Friedman, differs from standard non-disclosures like not naming a starting goalie, and it may have inadvertently fuelled rumours and speculation.\n\nRelated: Beating Marchand's Game: Maple Leafs Discipline Can Defeat Agitation\n\nMarek added that, while the team might aim to avoid media distractions by withholding details, the complete lack of information can create an environment ripe for speculation, potentially amplifying distractions during critical playoff moments. This discussion underscored the delicate balance teams face in information dissemination. Both analysts suggest a more transparent approach, even if selective, could better manage player situations and public perception without compromising strategic advantages.\n\nInterestingly, Friedman and Marek outline a lesson here for all of us. Their key focus is their belief the team could have managed the narrative better. There's a difference between strategic communication and effectively navigating the complexities of playoff scenarios.\n\nAs Game 3 approaches, fans will be seeking lineup announcements. They want to see Nylander back in the frray and move past the Bruins into the second round. In the meantime, a lesson has been outlined about why clarity -- even if it is strategic -- is crucial for organizational trust.\n\nIn the meantime, let's hope Nylander can return to the team's lineup and become part of their push for the coveted Stanley Cup.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "old_prof@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Old Prof", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliotte_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elliotte Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Landeskog", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Landeskog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/William-Nylander-Maple-Leafs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508801", "eventUri": "eng-9508801", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

In fact, a majority of Raycroft's early professional career in the AHL, playing in 121 games on the Bruins' farm club with a 56-48-13 record.\n\nHowever, the 2003-04 season was anything but average for Raycroft and the Bruins. It proved vital to the future of the franchise.\n\nRaycroft's Calder Trophy-Winning Season\n\nWith Steve Shields, Jeff Hackett, and John Grahame all departing, Raycroft was given the opportunity to be the starter in Boston, beating out Felix Potvin for the role in training camp. He proceeded to find lightning in a bottle for the best season in his professional career.\n\nThe Belleville, Ontario-native played in 57 games for the Bruins during the 2003-04 season and quickly became a household name in Boston. Raycroft went 29-18-9 with a 2.05 goals-against average and .926 save percentage. That season, his statistics were comparable to Martin Brodeur, Marty Turco, and Miikka Kiprusoff.\n\nNot too shabby for a rookie goaltender to be rubbing shoulders with some legends at the position.\n\nIn the same season, an 18-year-old, Quebec-born rookie named Patrice Bergeron was also a rookie in Boston. Combined with Raycroft, they helped the Bruins to a Northeast Division title and paired up in this famous ad campaign. Both rookies did their part in guiding the Black and Gold to the playoffs that season.\n\nRaycroft earned Hart and Vezina Trophy consideration for his stellar regular season performance and took home the Calder Trophy as the league's best rookie. He beat out future Bruin Michael Ryder, the aforementioned Bergeron, Joffrey Lupul, and Eric Staal, among others, for the honor.\n\nFalling Back to Earth\n\nWhile play was halted for the 2004-05 NHL Lockout, the young netminder spent time in Finland, playing for Tappara Tampere. However, Raycroft couldn't find his groove after six-plus months off from the game. After the lockout ended and hockey resumed for the 2005-06 season, his struggles continued.\n\nThat year, Raycroft lost his job and mojo in Boston. He played in just 30 games that season, going 8-19-2 with a putrid 3.71 goals-against and .879 save percentage. The Bruins were the fifth-worst team in the NHL that season and Raycroft quickly found himself third on the depth chart behind Hannu Toivanen and Tim Thomas, who led Boston to a Stanley Cup five years later.\n\nBoston was in transition during the 2005-06 season. Captain Joe Thornton was traded, coach Mike Sullivan was fired, and Jeff Gorton became the interim general manager after Mike O'Connell was dismissed. Raycroft had his own transition that season, as it was the first that required goalies to wear sleeker equipment.\n\nOn June 24, 2006, Gorton engineered one of the greatest heists in Bruins history, trading Raycroft to the Toronto Maple Leafs for 2005 first-round pick Tuukka Rask. Boston had the option of choosing either him or fellow Leafs prospect Justin Pogge. That's a pretty good return for a player who was nearly released prior to the trade. (from 'Simmons: Bruins would have taken Pogge instead of Rask from Maple Leafs for Raycroft,' Toronto Sun, 06/08/2013)\n\nThe other option, Pogge, played just six games in the NHL. Raycroft spent just two seasons in Toronto. Rask is now the Bruins' franchise goaltender for the foreseeable future.\n\nThankfully for Bruins fans, Gorton made the right call. On the other hand, Toronto gave up valuable assets for a potential starting goalie, much like they did years later for both Jonathan Bernier and Frederik Andersen.\n\nAfter joining the Maple Leafs, Raycroft went on to put up respectable numbers during the 2006-07 season. He tied Ed Belfour's franchise record for wins in a season, with 37, and played in an unthinkable 72 games. Toronto fell one point short of making the playoffs, dropping the penultimate game of the season to the eighth-place New York Islanders. A win there would have propelled the Leafs into the postseason.\n\nUnfortunately, Raycroft's career spiraled in a hurry after that season. The 11-year veteran proceeded to play for four different teams in the final six seasons of his NHL career. Colorado, Vancouver, and Dallas all took a chance hoping he could find a way to find the form that he had in 2003-04.\n\nRaycroft was never able to resurrect his career in the NHL. After no team signed him during the summer of 2012, he played for one season in Italy and another in Sweden before retiring from professional hockey.\n\nIn an interview, Raycroft disclosed his reasoning to the Boston Globe's Nancy Marrapese-Burrell.\n\nIt was an amazing experience for [my family] but we just couldn't do it another year, there was just no way. Hockey was fun but it wasn't enjoyable enough to keep playing.\n\nHe is married with three children. It was difficult for him to pack up his entire family multiple times over six years and find a stable place to live, making the decision to retire easier.\n\nAfter hanging up his skates, he was brought on as a volunteer coach at the University of Connecticut to assist their goaltenders as the university entered its inaugural season playing in Hockey East, one of the toughest college conferences in the country. Raycroft has also spent time as a guest studio analyst for the Bruins, providing valuable insight on the game.\n\nTo this day, Boston is still reaping the benefits of his Calder season in 2003-04. Raycroft's short-term success enabled the Bruins to secure a major piece of their long-term future. Rask was one of the better goalies in the league this season and Boston is a Stanley Cup contender.\n\nFor Raycroft, he joined many others as someone who enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame at the NHL level but could never achieve consistency at a decent pace thereafter. (from 'Jonathan Cheechoo and the NHL's biggest one-hit wonders since 2000,' Chicago Sun-Times, 03/06/2018) Some, like Jonathan Cheechoo, benefitted from others and struggled on their own. Some, like Jimmy Carson, suffered injuries and never reached their peak again. For Raycroft, the 2004-05 NHL Lockout and subsequent changes to the game altered his future and prevented him from returning to his rookie form.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType":

She is now getting the help she needs to help with the tax bill.\"\n\nDerek passed at the beginning of 2024 following a long battle with Covid.\n\nHacker Young specialises in companies and individuals who need help with \"tax investigations and litigation support\".\n\nHacker Young says of its expertise: \"Unfortunately, disputes with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) do arise and appear to be increasing at an alarming rate.\n\n\"Often, the matter can be resolved relatively quickly.

I'm doing something similar myself. I've just had to withdraw the bit you can tax-free for my pension to pay belated bills for my husband that passed away.\n\n\"I am ashamed of the fact that I am in debt because I have an incredible job that I love, that's very well paid. I'm not a carer travelling miles, paying their own transport to go and help somebody for minimum wage. I'm somebody that is very well paid and so I just feel a shame that I couldn't make it work.\"\n\nIn March, Kate told how Derek's medical bills put a huge financial strain on the family in an ITV documentary.\n\nHe died at the age of 56 in January, following a long battle with the long-term effects of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the documentary, Kate said: \"Derek's care costs more than my salary from ITV and that is before you pay for a mortgage, before you pay any household bills, before you pay for anything for the kids, so we are at a crunch point.\n\n\"I am in debt.

The source said: \"Kate has made no secret of her financial issues which include Derek's medical care bills and the collapse of his company. She is now getting the help she needs to help with the tax bill.\"\n\nDerek died at the start of the year after a lengthy battle with Covid. Hacker Young specialises in companies and individuals who need help with \"tax investigations and litigation support\".\n\nHacker Young says of its expertise: \"Unfortunately, disputes with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) do arise and appear to be increasing at an alarming rate.\n\nKate recently revealed on GMB that she'd been forced to cash in her pension after Derek's death\n\n\"Often, the matter can be resolved relatively quickly. Where it can't, we can advise you on the alternatives open to you and the merits and chances of success with each.\n\n\"We will advise you, warts-and-all, bearing in mind that cost is an important factor for you. Should you need advice in deciding whether to seek a local reconsideration of HMRC's decision or to lodge an appeal directly to the VAT & Duties Tribunal, we will be there to guide you and assist where needed.\"\n\nIt comes after Kate this week revealed on GMB that she'd been forced to cash in her pension. She told a guest, who has had to pay \u00a315,000 for their own private healthcare: \"You need every penny of that pension. I'm doing something similar myself. I've just had to withdraw the bit you can tax-free for my pension to pay belated bills for my husband that passed away.\n\n\"I am ashamed of the fact that I am in debt because I have an incredible job that I love, that's very well paid. I'm not a carer travelling miles, paying their own transport to go and help somebody for minimum wage. I'm somebody that is very well paid and so I just feel a shame that I couldn't make it work.\"\n\nBack in March in an ITV documentary she told how Derek's medical bills put a huge financial strain on the family. He died at the age of 56 in January, after a lengthy battle with the long-term effects of the coronavirus.\n\nIn the documentary, Kate said: \"Derek's care costs more than my salary from ITV and that is before you pay for a mortgage, before you pay any household bills, before you pay for anything for the kids, so we are at a crunch point.\n\n\"I am in debt. I can't earn enough money to cover my debt because I am managing Derek's care and I can't even use the money I do have to support Derek's recovery, because it's going on the basics all the time.\"\n\nKate added: \"Listen, I'm not going to pretend that I am poorly paid, I have an incredible job that I love, which is well-paid, but it's not enough.\"\n\nThe Good Morning Britain presenter estimated her debts to be between \u00a3500,000-\u00a3800,000 at the time.\n\nSpeaking when Derek was still alive on the doc, she added: \"Derek's care, the basic needs, not including any therapy, which I am happy to pay on top, is nearly \u00a34,000 a week.

Rest gently and peacefully now Derek, my love, I was so lucky to have you in my life.'\n\nDerek was a former researcher for Blairite Peter Mandelson who became a New Labour spin doctor and later retrained as a psychotherapist after a series of political and lobbying scandals.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is set to write privately to Kate on behalf of the Labour Party.\n\nThe presenter announced the death of her husband of 18 years on Instagram on Friday morning\n\nKate Garraway faced financial hardship as a result of the high costs involved in caring for her husband Derek Draper, prior to his death at the age of 56\n\n'The strength of character and courage she's shown, quite simply, is indescribable.\n\n'She would come into work, every single day, after three hours of broken sleep, plaster on a smile, and sit in make-up having her heartbroken, tear-stained face covered with studio make-up. It was truly remarkable.'\n\nTragically, Derek was among the first in the UK to fall seriously ill with Covid-19 and was admitted to an intensive care unit as the country entered lockdown in March 2020.\n\nHe was one of the country's longest-suffering Covid patients after being in hospital but never fully recovered after the virus left long-lasting damage to his organs and meant he needed round-the-clock care.\n\nA source close to Kate, who works with her at ITV, told The Sun: 'Kate has been through hell and back - and, by virtue of her career, it's all been played out in the public domain.'\n\nMailOnline understands that Derek passed away on Wednesday night in a North London hospital.

hospitalised for 13 months\n\nDerek had been plagued with health woes after contracting Covid in 2020 and suffered a cardiac arrest in early December, with Kate spending Christmas at hospital.\n\nThe heartbreaking turn of events came after it was reported Derek was 'in great spirits' and looking forward to Christmas with his family.\n\nA source told The Sun at the time: 'It was sudden and a shock as he had been doing so well and was in great spirits, looking forward to Christmas at home with the family.\n\n'This setback has been a huge blow for his family and all the people caring for him.\n\n'Kate has been utterly incredible -- by his side while being an amazing mum to Darcey and Billy, and trying to manage their expectations of a family Christmas.'\n\nDerek was in and out of hospital after he fell seriously ill with coronavirus at the very start of the pandemic in March 2020, and was left with lasting damage to his organs.\n\nDoctors put him in a medically induced coma and he became the longest-suffering coronavirus patient in the UK after spending 13 months in hospital, apart from Kate and their two children.\n\nHowever, he was readmitted several times with numerous health issues, including kidney failure, brain inflammation and liver damage.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

After experiencing excruciating pain and being forced to use a wheelchair, Lindy explained that she felt she had no option but to pay \u00a315,000 from her pension to go private.\n\nKate sympathised with the guest, revealing that she, too, was forced to withdraw part of her pension to pay for medical bills.\n\n\"I am doing something similar myself,\" said Kate. \"I have had to withdraw the bit you can tax-free from my pension to pay for belated bills for my husband, who has now passed away.\n\n\"People are having to do things - it wasn't a huge pension in the first place - which aren't what they saved for and some people don't have any savings at all.\"\n\n\"It's supposed to be a system that's meant to catch you if you fall. But actually, it feels like it's trying to catch you out,\" she said.\n\n\"You feel like you're in the dock answering questions about things that will literally mean life or death to someone you love. Derek's needs were clearly so great, yet he didn't warrant funded care -- so you think, 'If he isn't getting it, then who is?'\"\n\n\"To be fair to them, no one's contacted me since he's passed away to ask for that,\" continued the journalist. \"They may well still do, but they haven't as yet. The bigger picture of the further appeals I haven't addressed yet, because I'm still in survival mode.\"\n\nIt's also been reported that Kate is considering selling her family home in north London to cover the debts.\n\nAfter falling seriously ill with coronavirus in 2020, Derek spent 13 months in hospital and after being discharged, required round-the-clock care at home.\n\nBefore his death, Derek was in a clinic in Mexico undergoing pioneering brain cell treatment for the disabling effects of the disease. When Kate arrived in Mexico from London, she was told that her husband had suffered a cardiac arrest whilst she was mid-flight.\n\nAlthough doctors restarted his heart and Derek underwent 14 hours of neurosurgery, he never regained consciousness. On January 3, he \"slipped away\" with his wife and two children, Darcey and Billy, by his side.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicky_morris@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Nicky Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Garraway", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Garraway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Balls", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ed Balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurosurgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c40789e55df3-kate-garraway-return-gmb.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544564", "eventUri": "eng-9544564", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-03", "textStart": 2246, "textEnd": 2255}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

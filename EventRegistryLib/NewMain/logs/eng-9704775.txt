Hana's lawyers began presenting their case by calling one of Hana's employees as a witness.\n\nProsecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday.

Bob Menendez has rested without the New Jersey Democrat testifying at his New York bribery trial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The defense for Sen. Bob Menendez rested Wednesday without the New Jersey Democrat testifying at his New York bribery trial.\n\nLawyers for Menendez called several witnesses over two days in an effort to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors.\n\nMenendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors to the benefit of three New Jersey businessmen.\n\nTwo of the businessmen -- Fred Daibes and Wael Hana -- are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.\n\nDaibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though Judge Sidney H. Stein told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers were to start presenting their case.\n\nProsecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.\n\nLawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.\n\nAn FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he directed that more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars be seized in the raid because he suspected that a crime may have occurred.\n\nAmong witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.\n\n\"It's normal.

After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.\n\nProsecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.\n\nThey also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in

Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify Wednesday at his New York trial because he believes prosecutors failed to prove \"every aspect\" of the bribery case against him, a decision that cleared the way for closing arguments as early as Monday.\n\nLawyers for the Democrat rested their case after calling several witnesses over two days to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors.\n\nMenendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors benefiting three New Jersey businessmen.\n\nJudge Sidney H. Stein asked Menendez to rise from his seat to confirm that the decision not to testify was his alone. Menendez said that after extensive talks with his lawyers, he had decided against taking the stand.\n\nAs he left the courthouse, Menendez told reporters: \"From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case.\"\n\nHe said that to \"give them another chance\" by taking the witness stand was \"simply not something that makes any sense to me whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I expect my lawyers will produce a powerful and convincing summation, deduce how the evidence came out, and where they failed across the board, and how the jury will render a verdict of not guilty,\" Menendez said before wishing reporters who followed him to his car a \"Happy Fourth of July.\"\n\nTwo of the businessmen he is accused of bribing -- Fred Daibes and Wael Hana -- are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.\n\nDaibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though the judge told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers began presenting their case by calling one of Hana's employees as a witness.\n\nProsecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.\n\nLawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.\n\nAn FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he ordered the seizure of more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars during the raid because he suspected that a crime may have taken place.\n\nAmong witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.\n\n\"It's normal.

They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.\n\nAn FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he directed that more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars be seized in the raid because he suspected that a crime may have occurred.\n\nAmong witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.\n\n\"It's normal. It's a Cuban thing,\" she said.\n\nBob Menendez was born after the family arrived in Manhattan.\n\nMenendez has pleaded not guilty to bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.\n\nProsecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.\n\nThey also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.\n\nA previous corruption prosecution of Menendez on unrelated charges ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify Wednesday at his New York trial because he believes prosecutors failed to prove \"every aspect\" of the bribery case against him, a decision that cleared the way for closing arguments as early as Monday.\n\nLawyers for the Democrat rested their case after calling several witnesses over two days to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nMenendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors benefiting three New Jersey businessmen.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJudge Sidney H. Stein asked Menendez to rise from his seat to confirm that the decision not to testify was his alone. Menendez said that after extensive talks with his lawyers, he had decided against taking the stand.\n\nAs he left the courthouse, Menendez told reporters: \"From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case.\"\n\nHe said that to \"give them another chance\" by taking the witness stand was \"simply not something that makes any sense to me whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I expect my lawyers will produce a powerful and convincing summation, deduce how the evidence came out, and where they failed across the board, and how the jury will render a verdict of not guilty,\" Menendez said before wishing reporters who followed him to his car a \"Happy Fourth of July.\"\n\nTwo of the businessmen he is accused of accepting bribes from -- Fred Daibes and Wael Hana -- are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDaibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though the judge told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers began presenting their case by calling one of Hana's employees as a witness.\n\nProsecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.\n\nLawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.\n\nAn FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he ordered the seizure of more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars during the raid because he suspected that a crime may have taken place.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAmong witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.\n\n\"It's normal. It's a Cuban thing,\" she said.\n\nBob Menendez was born after the family arrived in Manhattan.\n\nMenendez has pleaded not guilty to bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.\n\nProsecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.\n\nThey also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA previous corruption prosecution of Menendez on unrelated charges ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to clarify that Menendez is accused of accepting, not giving, bribes.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_H._Stein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidney H.

Bob Menendez rested Wednesday without the New Jersey Democrat testifying at his New York bribery trial.\n\nLawyers for Menendez called several witnesses over two days in an effort to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors.\n\nMenendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors to the benefit of three New Jersey businessmen.\n\nTwo of the businessmen -- Fred Daibes and Wael Hana -- are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.\n\nPeople are also reading... A Buffalo teacher thought he chatted with a teen online. He got a surprise when he went to meet her Foxglove Pub in Hamburg closes its doors: 'The business just wasn't for us' Mike Harrington: Sabres are (naturally) thrilled with another first-rounder, but what about the deals? Inside Clarence's new million-dollar home development Sabres acquire fourth-line winger Beck Malenstyn for second-round draft pick Mike Harrington: Kevyn Adams maintains offseason is 'incomplete.' So what happens after Skinner buyout? Erie County real estate transactions Casey Mittelstadt's contract in Colorado may be a sign of Sabres' plan at center Long discussed, the DL&W is poised to become waterfront 'anchor' Sabres notes: GM Kevyn Adams trading back in first round could lead to bigger move Sabres begin process to walk away from Jeff Skinner's contract with three years left At fraud trial, Buffalo debt collectors describe their scripts threatening arrests: 'We told debtors we were coming' Niagara Falls firm sues Hotel Niagara developer for breach of contract Buffalo Diocese's lawyers want $150,000 for legal work to keep sex abuse records secret Hamburg resident dies in crash on Niagara Thruway in Buffalo\n\nDaibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though Judge Sidney H. Stein told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers were to start presenting their case.\n\nProsecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.\n\nLawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.\n\nAn FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he directed that more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars be seized in the raid because he suspected that a crime may have occurred.\n\nAmong witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.\n\n\"It's normal. It's a Cuban thing,\" she said.\n\nBob Menendez was born after the family arrived in Manhattan.\n\nMenendez has pleaded not guilty to bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.\n\nProsecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.\n\nThey also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.\n\nA previous corruption prosecution of Menendez on unrelated charges ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bob Menendez called on family and forensic accountants this week as his attorneys made the case that the New Jersey Democrat took no bribes from wealthy businessmen and that his Cuban-refugee parents taught him to stash bundles of money at home.\n\nMenendez, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is accused of acting as a foreign agent for Egypt, declined Wednesday to take the witness stand in his own defense. Closing arguments in the case are expected to begin Monday.\n\nFive people - his sister, sister-in-law, a prominent New Jersey lawyer and two forensic accountants - testified on his behalf. One accountant told the jury that Menendez withdrew cash from a credit union account in increments of around $400 on more than 300 occasions during a 14-year stretch.\n\n\"Daddy always said don't trust the banks,\" the lawmaker's sister, Caridad Gonzalez, told jurors as the defense's initial witness. Their father, mother and aunt, she recalled, all had a habit of storing cash around the house after the family fled persecution in Cuba in 1951, before Menendez was born in New York.\n\nIt became part of the family lore, Gonzalez testified, and Menendez has been keeping cash at home since at least the 1980s. Federal prosecutors said the FBI seized more than $486,000 in bribes from his house in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., during a court-authorized search in June 2022.\n\n\"He doesn't take cash for anything,\" Gonzalez said in a testy moment under cross-examination, denying that her \"baby brother\" would have accepted bribes from businessmen with ties to Egypt and Qatar. His motivation for holding public office? \"He does it because that's what he does; he serves people,\" she said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan concluded their case Friday after seven weeks. They narrated emails, photos, text messages, voicemails, bank records and other pieces of evidence linking both Menendez and his wife, the former Nadine Arslanian, to businessmen who were seeking the lawmaker's help lining up deals with Egyptian and Qatari officials or hoping to have Menendez quash several criminal investigations by authorities in New Jersey.\n\nMenendez is charged with bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent for Egypt. He could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted on all counts. He and the two New Jersey businessmen on trial with him, Fred Daibes and Wael \"Will\" Hana, have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez also has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to be tried later.\n\nOn Wednesday, the senator told U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein that he had decided not to testify after mulling it over \"at length\" with his lawyers. Later in the afternoon, he elaborated briefly outside the courthouse.\n\n\"From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case,\" Menendez told reporters.\n\nHis attorneys argue that he was broken up with Arslanian for part of 2018 after discovering she was still seeing an ex-boyfriend. They say the couple could not have been operating a bribery scheme during that pause in their romance.\n\nBut prosecutors contend the two were hard at work beginning in early 2018 and continuing through 2022, meeting with Egyptian intelligence officials and assisting them with policy priorities in Congress while expecting that Hana would settle the bill later on with bribes.\n\nDefense attorney Avi Weitzman portrayed the ex-boyfriend as controlling and ever-present in Arslanian's life, even after the senator entered the picture. A witness testified that Arslanian obtained a temporary restraining order against him in May 2018, months after she began dating Menendez.\n\n\"I worry about your safety and well-being,\" Menendez wrote to her in a 2018 text message. \"My disappointment, however, does not change my love for you. You are the love of my life and hopefully we can live in peace and happiness the rest of our lives.\"\n\nAt one point the judge complained that the defense was turning the trial into a \"bad soap opera.\" The ex-boyfriend, lawyer Doug Anton, has said Nadine Menendez's accusations against him are false.\n\nKatia Tabourian, who is Nadine Menendez's younger sister, testified Monday that it was not uncommon within their family - which has roots in Armenia, Cyprus and Lebanon - to give gold, jewelry and cash as gifts. Nadine Menendez inherited their grandmother's gold bars and was also given gold by their father, Tabourian said.\n\nThe Menendezes married in the fall of 2020. Prosecutors allege that Nadine had cash and gold bars from Daibes and Hana in her bedroom closet when the FBI search took place.\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutors, Gonzalez and Tabourian said they were close to Menendez and did not want to see him in trouble. The senator's daughter, MSNBC anchor Alicia Menendez, sat in the front row of the courtroom gallery as Gonzalez testified. Afterward, the two women embraced and walked together out of the courtroom, followed by a beaming Menendez.\n\nThe trial is breaking for Independence Day and will resume Monday.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forensic accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Agents Registration Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courtroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_H._Stein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidney H.

Bob Menendez won't testify in corruption case as defense rests", "body": "July 3 (UPI) -- The defense in the bribery trial of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez rested its case Wednesday without calling the long-serving Democratic lawmaker from New Jersey to testify.\n\nMenendez informed the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein, that he would not take the stand in his own defense shortly before his legal team rested their case, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 70-year-old senator and his wife, Nadine, are facing separate trials in New York on charges of bribery, obstruction and acting as a foreign agent. Bob Menendez is accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for political influence.\n\nHis trial began eight weeks ago and is now expected to proceed to closing arguments on Monday.\n\nBoth he and his wife have pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and following Wednesday's court session, Menendez told reporters he chose not to testify because he believes his lawyers have disproven the case against him.\n\n\"From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case, and for me to testify and give them another chance for a second summation -- go through the whole case again, and then go ahead and have their summation, and then have a rebuttal case at the end -- it's simply something that doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever,\" he said.\n\nProsecutors contend Menendez abused his office and acted as an unregistered foreign agent of Egypt and Qatar. They claim he and his wife accepted cash, gold bars and a Mercedes car in exchange for helping a halal meat monopoly, granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution.\n\nMore than $480,000 in cash -- some of it stuffed into shoes and boxes -- and 13 gold bars worth more than $100,000 were found in a search of Menendez' home. Nearly $80,000 was found in Nadine Menendez' deposit box at a bank nearby.\n\nDefense attorneys say the hoarding of cash and gold at home is the result of psychological trauma Menendez suffered from his experiences as a member of a Cuban refugee family and the suicide of his father. They also claim the couple led largely separate lives and were not aware of each other's financial dealings.\n\nMenendez in May revealed his wife has breast cancer.\n\nThe trial has not stopped him from filing for re-election.

Prosecutors claimed he had agreed to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, a convertible, and 13 gold bars in exchange for steering aid to Egypt, facilitating a halal meat monopoly, and disrupting criminal investigations on behalf of his friends.\n\nMenendez, 70, and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were both charged in the yearslong scheme.\n\nShe was supposed to be on trial with her husband, but her court date has been pushed back to at least August while she recovers from breast cancer.\n\nBob Menendez is on trial with two of the New Jersey businessmen accused of bribing him after a third pleaded guilty and cut a deal with the government.\n\nBob Menendez, Nadine Menendez, Wael Hana, and Fred Daibes have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nEarlier this week, Bob Menendez's sister Caridad Gonzalez, 80, testified that storing cash in one's home is a \"Cuban thing\" in an attempt to explain why federal agents found $480,000 in cash during a raid at the senator's New Jersey home last year.\n\nGonzalez said her family was forced to leave everything behind when they fled Cuba and that the only money they had was what her father hid in the false bottom of a grandfather clock.\n\nShe insisted that Cubans often hid cash at home because they were distrustful of the banks and government.\n\n\"It's a Cuban thing,\" said Gonzalez, the first witness to testify for the defense. \"They were afraid of losing what they worked so hard for.\"\n\nGonzalez was 8 years old when her parents fled Cuba, three years before Menendez was born in New York City.\n\nGonzalez testified that the habit of keeping cash on hand had been drilled into her and her brother by their parents, who often told harrowing tales of police officers pressuring their father to shut down a manufacturing facility he operated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Daddy always said: 'Don't trust the banks. If you trust the banks, you never know what can happen. So you must always have money at home,'\" she said.\n\nGonzalez's testimony was key for the defense as it tried to explain why FBI agents had found 13 gold bars, cash, and other pricey items at Menendez's home.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barnini_chakraborty@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Barnini Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bobmenendez628.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704775", "eventUri": "eng-9704775", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Bob Menendez decided not to take the stand in his own defense against federal corruption charges, though he talked about it \"at length\" with his attorneys.\n\nMenendez (D-N.J.) told U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein on Wednesday afternoon he would not testify, moments before his team of lawyers rested their defense case.\n\nProsecutors, who indicted him last fall, \"failed\" to prove their case, Menendez told reporters as he left a Manhattan federal courthouse.\n\nThe senator, who is accused of accepting bribes to disrupt state and federal criminal cases and to help the Egyptian government obtain American military aid, called five witnesses this week after the government spent over two months having people testify.\n\nMenendez, standing trial for the second time, said it \"makes no sense to me whatsoever\" to give prosecutors another chance to summarize their case against him with him on the stand.\n\nAfter a corruption case mistrial in 2017, he gave a victory speech outside a New Jersey federal courthouse that explained his decision not to take the stand then, using at least one similar reason. He said his testimony would have given prosecutors a chance to \"redo their entire meritless case in chief all over again.\"\n\nEarlier this week, during legal arguments in front of the judge without jurors present, Menendez attorney Adam Fee seemed to preview his team's closing arguments.\n\n\"There's no direct proof of the schemes alleged,\" Fee said. \"It's only about the strength of inferences.\"\n\nProsecutors spent the past two months sketching out the basis for the inferences they hope jurors draw to convict Menendez as a \"senator on the take.\"\n\nThey found over a half million dollars in cash during a home search and have tied Menendez and his wife to about a quarter million dollars in gold bars, much of which was also found in the home.

Menendez rests his defense in federal bribery trial", "body": "UNION CITY, NEW JERSEY - SEPTEMBER 25: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) speaks during a press conference at Hudson County Community College's North Hudson Campus on September 25, 2023 in Union City, New Jersey. Menendez spoke during a press conference where he stated that he would not resign as senator and would serve out his term. The three-term senator and his wife are accused of taking bribes of gold bars, a luxury car, and cash in exchange for using his position to help the government of Egypt and other corrupt acts according to an indictment from SDNY unsealed on Friday. The indictment is the second in eight years against Menendez. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, in his first words in court since his federal bribery trial started eight weeks ago in Manhattan, told the judge Wednesday that he would not speak in his own defense and rested his case after just two days of witnesses testifying on his behalf.\n\n\"I'm not seeking to take the stand at this time,\" New Jersey's senior senator told Judge Sidney H. Stein, assuring the jurist he had discussed the matter \"at length\" with his attorneys.\n\nHis codefendant Fred Daibes called no witnesses and rested his case Wednesday -- also opting not to testify. Attorneys for Wael Hana, another codefendant, began his defense late Wednesday afternoon and expect to call one more witness and then rest Monday.\n\nStein told prosecutors to be ready to deliver their closing arguments Monday afternoon, and jurors are expected to begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday. The ongoing corruption trial is the Democratic senator's second in seven years; his first ended in a hung jury in 2017.\n\nAfter testimony by the senator's sister and sister-in-law riveted jurors Monday, Wednesday was an anticlimactic end to the senator's defense in a trial that was expected to end a week ago. Stein, as well as attorneys for all three defendants, have increasingly expressed concerns about \"losing jurors\" as the trial has fallen behind because of round-the-clock evidentiary disputes, late-arriving jurors, Daibes' bout with COVID-19, and other random interruptions, like jurors getting stuck in an elevator and the jury room getting flooded by a sink left running over a weekend.\n\nStein on Wednesday doubled down on his frequent vows to speed proceedings up, telling Hana's attorney Lawrence Lustberg that he won't wait on a witness Lustberg aims to call to the stand Monday -- who's now stuck in Egypt awaiting a visa.\n\n\"We're all going to be as efficient as possible in the use of this jury. I'm not going to significantly delay things for that issue,\" Stein said. \"The rule in my court is: If you don't have a witness, you rest.\"\n\nWednesday, several jurors dozed intermittently as Menendez's lawyers presented their final two witnesses in their case.\n\nUnder questioning by Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman, forensic accountant David Gannaway presented texts and other documents intended to add context to rebut or at least cast doubt on prosecutors' case.\n\nJurors also heard a prerecorded video deposition of attorney Michael Critchley, who represented a trucking company owner in an insurance fraud case filed by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Prosecutors have said Hana and codefendant Jose Uribe bribed Menendez to derail the office's prosecution of E&K Trucking owner Elvis Parra, Uribe's friend, because Uribe worried the attorney general's expanding probe would reach the insurance company he was running illegally. Uribe pleaded guilty in March and testified against his codefendants last month in a cooperation deal.\n\nCritchley testified that Menendez called him in March 2019 to complain that Parra's case was \"an abuse of prosecution,\" and the men agreed the Attorney General's Office was being used by insurance companies to collect private debt.\n\nUnder Weitzman's questioning, Critchley said the senator did nothing \"inappropriate or improper\" and that he occasionally talked with Menendez about criminal cases that made the news. Parra eventually agreed to a plea deal with a sentence of noncustodial probation, but Critchley said the plea offer was made because state prosecutors had \"a weak case\" and not, as prosecutors allege, because Menendez called and met with Gurbir Grewal, then the attorney general, in a deal with Uribe that required the senator to \"kill and stop all investigation.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Lara Pomerantz, Critchley conceded the case did not receive much publicity and that Menendez never raised concerns about the office unfairly targeting Hispanic truckers, as the senator's defense team has claimed.\n\nHana's team began their defense late Wednesday by calling Carolina Silvarredonda, who works for Hana at his Uruguay office, to the stand.\n\nSilvarredonda told jurors she was Hana's assistant in September 2019 when Hana hired the senator's wife, Nadine, to set up offices for his halal meat exporting company, IS EG Halal, as it expanded to other countries after landing a monopoly in Egypt. Prosecutors have said that it was a sham job to mask $30,000 in bribes. Hana paid the couple for the senator's influence in helping him secure and keep his monopoly.\n\nSilvarredonda testified that she repeatedly asked Nadine to send her information about setting up an office in New Delhi, India, but the company gave the job to someone else when Nadine didn't send the needed information for three weeks.\n\n\"She didn't do what she was asked,\" she said.\n\nThe testimony backs up Hana's defense that the money was payment for a job -- and that he fired her when she didn't do the job.\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Daniel Richenthal, Silvarredonda agreed that she told Nadine her services were no longer needed on Oct. 17, 2019 -- and that Hana wrote Nadine a $10,000 check three weeks later, despite supposedly being fired.\n\nLustberg wanted to call three IS EG employees to show the company now is a thriving business that exports halal beef to multiple countries.\n\n\"The impression that the government has left is that it is a completely bogus enterprise that somehow got this contract based not on merits at all, but on corruption,\" Lustberg said.\n\nBut Stein barred their testimony, saying: \"Whether it's thriving or not thriving or somewhere in the middle today, is irrelevant.\"\n\nThe trial now is on break for the holiday weekend and is expected to resume Monday morning.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_H._Stein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sidney H.

Bob Menendez's defense rests in federal bribery trial; Closing arguments next week", "body": "Sen. Bob Menendez, in his first words in court since his federal bribery trial started eight weeks ago in Manhattan, told the judge Wednesday that he would not speak in his own defense and rested his case after just two days of witnesses testifying on his behalf.\n\n\"I'm not seeking to take the stand at this time,\" New Jersey's senior senator told Judge Sidney H. Stein, assuring the jurist he had discussed the matter \"at length\" with his attorneys.\n\nHis codefendant Fred Daibes called no witnesses and rested his case Wednesday -- also opting not to testify. Attorneys for Wael Hana, another codefendant, began his defense late Wednesday afternoon and expect to call one more witness and then rest Monday.\n\nStein told prosecutors to be ready to deliver their closing arguments Monday afternoon, and jurors are expected to begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday. The ongoing corruption trial is the Democratic senator's second in seven years; his first ended in a hung jury in 2017.\n\nAfter testimony by the senator's sister and sister-in-law riveted jurors Monday, Wednesday was an anticlimactic end to the senator's defense in a trial that was expected to end a week ago. Stein, as well as attorneys for all three defendants, have increasingly expressed concerns about \"losing jurors\" as the trial has fallen behind because of round-the-clock evidentiary disputes, late-arriving jurors, Daibes' bout with COVID-19, and other random interruptions, like jurors getting stuck in an elevator and the jury room getting flooded by a sink left running over a weekend.\n\nStein on Wednesday doubled down on his frequent vows to speed proceedings up, telling Hana's attorney Lawrence Lustberg that he won't wait on a witness Lustberg aims to call to the stand Monday -- who's now stuck in Egypt awaiting a visa.\n\n\"We're all going to be as efficient as possible in the use of this jury. I'm not going to significantly delay things for that issue,\" Stein said. \"The rule in my court is: If you don't have a witness, you rest.\"\n\nWednesday, several jurors dozed intermittently as Menendez's lawyers presented their final two witnesses in their case.\n\nUnder questioning by Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman, forensic accountant David Gannaway presented texts and other documents intended to add context to rebut or at least cast doubt on prosecutors' case.\n\nCharlie Stile: Can NJ elected officials influence criminal cases? Menendez trial tests question: Stile\n\nJurors also heard a prerecorded video deposition of attorney Michael Critchley, who represented a trucking company owner in an insurance fraud case filed by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Prosecutors have said Hana and codefendant Jose Uribe bribed Menendez to derail the office's prosecution of E&K Trucking owner Elvis Parra, Uribe's friend, because Uribe worried the attorney general's expanding probe would reach the insurance company he was running illegally. Uribe pleaded guilty in March and testified against his codefendants last month in a cooperation deal.\n\nCritchley testified that Menendez called him in March 2019 to complain that Parra's case was \"an abuse of prosecution,\" and the men agreed the Attorney General's Office was being used by insurance companies to collect private debt.\n\nUnder Weitzman's questioning, Critchley said the senator did nothing \"inappropriate or improper\" and that he occasionally talked with Menendez about criminal cases that made the news. Parra eventually agreed to a plea deal with a sentence of noncustodial probation, but Critchley said the plea offer was made because state prosecutors had \"a weak case\" and not, as prosecutors allege, because Menendez called and met with Gurbir Grewal, then the attorney general, in a deal with Uribe that required the senator to \"kill and stop all investigation.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Lara Pomerantz, Critchley conceded the case did not receive much publicity and that Menendez never raised concerns about the office unfairly targeting Hispanic truckers, as the senator's defense team has claimed.\n\nHana's team began their defense late Wednesday by calling Carolina Silvarredonda, who works for Hana at his Uruguay office, to the stand.\n\nSilvarredonda told jurors she was Hana's assistant in September 2019 when Hana hired the senator's wife, Nadine, to set up offices for his halal meat exporting company, IS EG Halal, as it expanded to other countries after landing a monopoly in Egypt. Prosecutors have said that it was a sham job to mask $30,000 in bribes that Hana paid the couple for the senator's influence in helping him secure and keep his monopoly.\n\nSilvarredonda testified that she repeatedly asked Nadine to send her information about setting up an office in New Delhi, India, but the company gave the job to someone else when Nadine didn't send the needed information for three weeks.\n\n\"She didn't do what she was asked,\" she said.\n\nThe testimony backs up Hana's defense that the money was payment for a job -- and that he fired her when she didn't do the job.\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Daniel Richenthal, Silvarredonda agreed that she told Nadine her services were no longer needed on Oct. 17, 2019 -- and that Hana wrote Nadine a $10,000 check three weeks later, despite supposedly being fired.\n\nLustberg wanted to call three IS EG employees to show the company now is a thriving business that exports halal beef to multiple countries.\n\n\"The impression that the government has left is that it is a completely bogus enterprise that somehow got this contract based not on merits at all, but on corruption,\" Lustberg said.\n\nBut Stein barred their testimony, saying: \"Whether it's thriving or not thriving or somewhere in the middle today, is irrelevant.\"\n\nThe trial now is on break for the holiday weekend and is expected to resume Monday morning.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Jersey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_defilippo@northjersey.com", "name": "Dana DeFilippo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_H._Stein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sidney H.

Prosecutors have said that it was a sham job to mask $30,000 in bribes that Hana paid the couple for the senator's influence in helping him secure and keep his monopoly.\n\nSilvarredonda testified that she repeatedly asked Nadine to send her information about setting up an office in New Delhi, India, but the company gave the job to someone else when Nadine didn't send the needed information for three weeks.\n\n\"She didn't do what she was asked,\" she said.\n\nThe testimony backs up Hana's defense that the money was payment for a job -- and that he fired her when she didn't do the job.\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Daniel Richenthal, Silvarredonda agreed that she told Nadine her services were no longer needed on Oct. 17, 2019 -- and that Hana wrote Nadine a $10,000 check three weeks later, despite supposedly being fired.\n\nLustberg wanted to call three IS EG employees to show the company now is a thriving business that exports halal beef to multiple countries.\n\n\"The impression that the government has left is that it is a completely bogus enterprise that somehow got this contract based not on merits at all, but on corruption,\" Lustberg said.\n\nBut Stein barred their testimony, saying: \"Whether it's thriving or not thriving or somewhere in the middle today, is irrelevant.\"\n\nThe trial now is on break for the holiday weekend and is expected to resume Monday morning.\n\nNew Jersey Monitor is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

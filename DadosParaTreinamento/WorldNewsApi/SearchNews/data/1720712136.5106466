The 2024 T20 World Cup steps up a notch today as one of the biggest matches in world sport takes centre stage in New York. Pakistan head into this mammoth Group A showdown with their fiercest rivals desperately needing to bounce back from their stunning Super Over defeat by tournament co-hosts the United States in Dallas on Thursday, a momentous result that went down as one of the biggest upsets in cricket history. Babar Azam\u2019s side completely and utterly unravelled in shocking fashion that day and will have to be much improved here to compete against India after the favourites began their own campaign with a dominant eight-wicket demolition of Ireland on Wednesday. Captain Rohit Sharma is ready to play after a couple of injury scares suffered this week, while Pakistan also have all-rounder Imad Wasim available following a rib issue.

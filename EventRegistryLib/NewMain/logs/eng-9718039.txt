His debut studio album, \"Issa Album,\" released in 2017, featured the hit single \"Bank Account,\" which solidified his status in hip-hop.\n\nHis second album, \"I Am > I Was,\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song for \"A Lot\" featuring J. Cole. 21 Savage is also recognized for his philanthropic efforts, including his 21 Savage Bank Account Campaign, which promotes financial literacy among young people.\n\nSo, with Wireless 2024 acting as a bit of a homecoming for the rapper, what could he perform during his headline set, what merchandise could be on offer and is Wireless his only UK date this year?\n\nThough 21 Savage is sharing the headline bill with J Hus on Saturday, we've concentrated on 21 Savage's potential setlist under the assumption that J Hus will be assisting at times with some of the duets. But you know what they say about assumptions.\n\nTruth be told, I'm pretty envious of some of the merchandise options that could be on offer at Wireless 2024. Being a fan of the oversized baseball jersey, that option along with several prints based around his \"American Dream\" cycle very much eschews the idea of a mere \"tour\" short - if we're lucky.\n\nTickets to see 21 Savage perform on Saturday, along with a limited amount of weekend, two-day and day tickets, are still available for the moment at Ticketmaster UK.\n\nIf you missed out on seeing 21 Savage at Wireless, or the weather isn't ideal for your festival season, 21 Savage will also be performing at Leeds and Reading Festival during the August Bank Holiday weekend, with tickets still available from Ticketmaster UK for both sites.", "source": {"uri": "sussexexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "SussexWorld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_jackson@sussexexpress.co.uk", "name": "Benjamin Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "21 Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Hus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J Hus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Account_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank Account (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaistow,_Newham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaistow, Newham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Plaistow, Newham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finsbury_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finsbury Park"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Finsbury Park"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rap_Song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Award for Best Rap Song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

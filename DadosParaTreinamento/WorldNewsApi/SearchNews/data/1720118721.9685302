{"id": 227488980, "title": "Balearics - one of the regions with the highest increase in squatting", "text": "Jorge Fe is the manager of Fuera Okupas, a company with a nationwide presence that started operations in the Balearics in 2022. The company acts as an intermediary to convince squatters to leave properties. \"In 99% of cases we succeed.\" Fe says that the Balearics are one of the regions of Spain where squatting has increased the most. In the final quarter of 2023, he points out, there was an 11% increase. Palma and Ibiza Town suffer the most, especially middle-class and working-class neighbourhoods as well as tourist areas. \"The wealthiest areas have fewer squatters because there aren't the empty properties.\" He is clear as to why squatting has been \"booming\". \"It's due to the housing law and the declaration of vulnerable person that prevents eviction.\" Tenants are considered vulnerable if they have lost their jobs or have experienced a substantial decrease in income of at least 40%. Vulnerability is also established if the total income of the family unit does not exceed the thresholds established by law. Tenant-squatters, he explains, pose the greatest challenge for his company. There are different types of squatter. \"Some act as if the property were theirs. They repair it, paint it; I have even come across fibre optics being installed at their request.\" Then there are those who rent out rooms. Others use them as drug flats or for prostitution. Mafias, Fe says, occupy properties in order to sell them. \"For 4,500 euros they sell a property. As the eviction process can last about two and a half years, it is profitable for the buyer. In Palma, you can't rent for less than 950 euros a month. That would mean an average expense of about 30,000 euros over the time it takes to recover the home. Instead, the squatter has been able to live in the property for 4,500 euros.\" Estate agencies provide potential squatters with information. \"This is their database, as they check on properties for sale or rent. They know that properties are empty. In no time they have the door open.\" The first thing Fuera Okupas tries to do is convince squatters to leave. If they don't succeed, they put security at the door 24 hours a day so that people can't get in. The price for this complete service is 2,500 euros plus IVA (VAT), which includes the legal process, if it is necessary to resort to this. The average time it takes to recover properties is between five and six weeks.", "summary": "Fuera Okupas, a company which acts as an intermediary to convince squatters to leave properties.", "url": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2024/06/02/124429/mallorca-squatting-balearics-region-with-the-highest-increase.html", "image": "https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/facebook/151519.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:28:04", "author": "Andrew Ede", "authors": ["Andrew Ede"], "language": "en", "source_country": "es", "sentiment": -0.496}

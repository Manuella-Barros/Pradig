Staff ReporterUpdated: Sunday, June 23, 2024, 12:59 AM IST Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh): Despite one interceptor vehicle and 20 speed radar guns provided to traffic police, there has been little action against overspeeding of vehicles in the city. The lone interceptor vehicle is unable to keep a check on almost 14 localities where overspeeding is rampant. The speed radar guns, although adequate in number, lie defunct, traffic police officials said. The city has 24 lakh commuters and sees daily traffic violation by as many as 8,000. Amid the chaos, the traffic police in the city are just concerned with penalising commuters for not wearing helmet and seat-belt violation. Apparently, overspeeding is the biggest reason behind road accidents and fatalities.

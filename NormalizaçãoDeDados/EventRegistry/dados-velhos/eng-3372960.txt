Virginia home for the darkest clothes he could find.\n\nThe 19-year-old didn't own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day.\n\nAs Bhatt drove into the city for his first-ever protest, he hesitated.\n\n\"I thought, there's a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,\" Bhatt told CNN. \"But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people's lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.\"\n\nBhatt joined protesters dressed completely in black, some with their faces covered by masks -- a tactic known as \"black bloc\" that aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities.\n\nAnd with them, Bhatt got arrested.\n\nHe was rounded up with more than 200 other people and charged with a felony for inciting a riot. He has said he didn't engage in any violence and has pleaded not guilty; an initial hearing is set for next month. A federal indictment charges individuals in the group with starting fires, property destruction and physical violence that erupted on the streets as the 45th President of the United States took his oath of office.\n\nMany of those arrested identified themselves as part of the Antifa movement. Its name derives from \"anti-fascist,\" and it has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the \"hard left\" -- an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites.\n\nAntifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism.\n\nWhile Antifa members don't fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society's fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don't conform to the traditional 9-to-5.\n\nAnd their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism -- as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.\n\nFrom Oregon to Germany\n\nAnti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle, and then more recently during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nBut their profile has been rising.\n\nAntifa demonstrators have marched in more than a half dozen protests since Election Day in Portland, Oregon, according to police.\n\nEarlier this year, Antifa activists were among those who smashed windows and set fires during protests at the University of California, Berkeley, leading to the cancellation of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and withdrawal of Ann Coulter as speakers.\n\nAntifa activists were in New York City on May Day.\n\nWhen the son of Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was arrested in Minnesota in March after protesting at a pro-Trump rally, he was dressed in black bloc alongside a group of Antifa supporters. He faces misdemeanor charges and has not yet entered a plea, but will be in court next month. A Kaine spokesperson says he was peacefully protesting, and wasn't disruptive.\n\nAnd white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others -- who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive. A 20-year-old man who had attended the rally later used his car to ram a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one of them.\n\nThough counterprotesters deny it they are to blame for violence, Trump this week declared \"blame on both sides\" -- and has drawn intense criticism for his view.\n\nIndeed, over the past year, Antifa members have been involved in clashes across the country and the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama and Nebraska, and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\"Anti-racists or anti-fascists are not a new phenomenon,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \"What I think is new is that they're more active both in making themselves prominent at violent rallies and also trying to bridge into the disenfranchised peaceful progressive movement.\"\n\nBhatt went in Charlottesville, too, and was just about five feet away from the car that drove through the crowd, killing protester Heather Heyer, he said.\n\nBefore that, he said, Antifa protesters were cheering in celebration for having disrupted the neo-Nazi message.\n\n\"We were marching down one of the streets, and energy was ecstatic,\" Bhatt said. \"We were marching and chanting and engaged in this huge act of solidarity. There was a moment I was at the front of this huge line of people, and we see this other huge group of people marching down another way, and when the two groups met, it felt like the entire city just erupted in cheers and roars.\"\n\nSpurred to action by Trump\n\nAntifa is impossible to track. It isn't united through a national organization, and it cloaks itself in anonymity.\n\nIn speaking to Antifa leaders across the country, CNN found very few who would take off their masks. Indeed, it took months to track down members willing to share their stories.\n\nMany are like Bhatt, a self-described government skeptic with liberal views who didn't find mainstream politics a good fit for him.\n\nSo, he weighed his options.\n\n\"Before J20 (January 20, Inauguration Day) happened I was convinced I'd go to NASA or some university to research,\" Bhatt said.\n\nNow facing a criminal record, \"I don't know,\" he said. \"My efforts might be better suited by an organization that helps communities.\"\n\nThe son of parents who immigrated from India, Bhatt is sure of one thing: He has no plans to stop protesting.\n\n\"There are people who were energized by Bernie (Sanders) that now are anarchists,\" said an organizer of the website It's Going Down, a newsblog for Antifa. \"People are freaked out by a Trump regime, freaked out by the far-right. A lot of people saw neo-Nazi symbols. There's a reason why people are becoming polarized. It's real-life stuff that's happening.\"\n\nSanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against \"hard-left\" violence, saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley appearance, \"I don't like this.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall,\" Sanders said. \"But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.\"\n\nThe organizer of It's Going Down said his website traffic has grown from a few hundred daily hits to between 10,000 and 40,000 hits on its best days.\n\n\"There's a crisis among the left,\" he said. \"And they're looking for alternatives outside of party structures. The anarchist movement is one that's working outside structures. ... People are excited about that.\"\n\nLike many young Antifa members who spoke with CNN, the turning point for Bhatt was when Trump in late 2015 ad-libbed a campaign remark toward a Black Lives Matter protester, saying he \"should have been roughed up.\"\n\nIn another moment that has catalyzed Antifa members, Trump in February 2016 told a campaign crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to \"knock the crap out of\" protesters holding tomatoes, adding, \"I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\n\n\"There was a normalization of political violence which first started with regard to the Trump rallies,\" Levin said.\n\n\"Indeed, we saw alt-right people manhandling African-American protesters,\" he said, using a term many white-rights activists use to describe themselves. \"Then what happened is these fiery embers crossed the fire line, so now on the far-left they say the best way to resist is violence because they're out-gunned in this new era of President Trump.\"\n\n'This is self-defense'\n\nFor almost three decades, Scott Crow was part of the Antifa movement.\n\n\"I fought (against) Nazis. I've had death threats. I've had guns drawn on me. I've drawn guns on fascists. I've been in altercations. I've smoke-bombed places,\" he said. \"I've done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years.\"\n\nActivists don black bloc, Crow said, as a means to an end.\n\n\"People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then, therefore, we are able to move more freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not,\" he said.\n\nAnd that means avoiding police, whom many Antifa members see as an enemy, as well as skirting the scrutiny Antifa activists often get from alt-right trolls on the Internet. Black bloc, one member told us, also unites the movement.\n\n\"Even though it only takes one person to break a window, it doesn't matter because the bloc moves together,\" said a 26-year-old named Maura, who wouldn't give her last name.\n\nIn New York's Union Square on May Day, a masked member of the Antifa group Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council told CNN why he wore black bloc and waved a black flag.\n\n\"We cover our face because the Nazis will try to find out who we are. And that is a very bad thing because they harass people,\" he said. \"We're trying to stop them from organizing. ... When they organize, they kill people, they hurt people, they fight people. And we're the ones who are fighting back.\"\n\nIt's a position taken by many Antifa activists: \"This is self-defense.\"\n\nAntifa activists often don't hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution.\n\n\"Violence against windows -- there's no such thing as violence against windows,\" a masked Antifa member in Union Square told CNN. \"Windows don't have -- they're not persons. And even when they are persons, the people we fight back against, they are evil. They are the living embodiment, they are the second coming of Hitler.\"\n\nCrow explained the ideology this way: \"Don't confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,\" echoing the words of John Adams.\n\n\"Each of us breaks the law every day. It's just that we make the conscious choice to do that,\" he said.\n\nAntifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren't physically attacking them. The movement, Crow said, sees alt-right hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have opted to meet violence with violence.\n\nRight or wrong, \"that's for history to decide,\" he said.\n\nBut Levin argues the violence is giving ammunition to racists -- and is anathema to the Antifa mission.\n\n\"It's killing the cause -- it's not hurting it, it's killing it, and it will kill it,\" Levin said. \"We're ceding the moral high ground and ceding the spotlight to where it should be, which is shining the spotlight on the vile.\"\n\nLevin, who for decades has attended rallies at both extremes to study radical groups, said he put his own body between an Antifa member and a Klan member when Antifa protesters attacked with knives at a February 2016 a rally in Anaheim, California.\n\n\"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Levin said. \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized. That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\"\n\nRubber bullets and pepper spray\n\nNearly seven months after Trump's election, police in Portland, Oregon, geared up for the 10th protest since Election Day pitting the alt-right and \"hard left.\"\n\nOn that day, June 4, police were coming off a violent May Day protest in which they watched Antifa activists run through the business district, destroying storefronts and setting fires.\n\nBefore the June event, \"we saw on social media that there was a lot of threats being put back and forth that gave us a lot of concern about physical violence,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said.\n\nHoping to keep June 4 from becoming another May Day, police created a human barricade. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder between two city squares -- one filled with alt-right groups, the other with Antifa activists.\n\nAfter a few hours, it seemed peace had won the day. But then police caught whispers that Antifa members were planning to push past police into the alt-right rally square.\n\nOfficers moved in with rubber bullets, pepper spray and smoke bombs. They pushed the masked Antifa activists into a corner and detained them. Many shed their black clothing and left it on the streets as police decided whom to arrest.\n\n\"We did seize a large number of weapons or things that could be used as weapons,\" Simpson said. \"Everything from knives to brass knuckles to poles and sticks and bricks and bottles and road flares and chains. One hundred percent, they came geared up to fight if it would be allowed.\"\n\nDespite Portland's liberal reputation, it has a history of clashes between extreme groups on the right and left. Residents have gotten fed up with the escalating violence, Simpson said.\n\n\"It is new, and this, like, this rumble mentality of, 'I'm going to bring my friends, you're going bring your friends, and we're going to fight it out in the park' -- it's not something we've seen here,\" Simpson said. \"It's not good for the city. People are just frustrated by it. It's affecting their livability. It's affecting their business. It's affecting their commute.\"\n\nLaw enforcement in several cities told CNN there's no excuse for the violence.\n\n\"The fires starting -- that we saw on May Day -- is something we haven't really seen much of in the past,\" Simpson said. \"The running through the street, breaking windows and everything in sight, we haven't seen it as consistently as we've seen it in the last eight months.\"\n\nIn that time, more than 150 people have been arrested. They range in age from 14 to 66, police records show, and include several students, a cook, a franchise restaurant owner and a retail manager, a CNN review of arrestees' social media accounts found.\n\nOn social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found.\n\nIn Berkeley, Antifa and alt-right activists have clashed several times since Election Day. Police say they haven't seen anything like this since the '60s.\n\nAnd in jurisdictions across the country, police told CNN they've started enforcing with new vigor laws that bar people from wearing masks during gatherings. For that reason, many Antifa members in Charlottesville did not wear masks, Bhatt said.\n\n\"It feels to me like there's a struggle in the country ... of the different kinds of speech and what's OK to say and what's not OK,\" Simpson said. \"But one thing is very clear is that free speech and protected speech can be very offensive and very hateful, but it's still not a crime.\"\n\n'Put your body in the way'\n\nWith no central leader, Antifa adherents have found each other in local communities. They communicate and recruit largely through social media. Their protests are organized via Facebook.\n\nAnd of late, in active areas, monthly meetings have increased in frequency to several times each week. Activists take martial arts classes together and strategize about how to achieve their main goal: taking down fascists.\n\nIn Portland, where the Rose City Antifa has been active for a decade, members focus on outing people they believe are neo-Nazis, even trying to get them fired and evicted from their homes.\n\n\"We've done mass mailings. We've even gone door to door before in communities,\" said the group's leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We've gone out to areas that we know that a lot of Nazis live with, like, 'wanted' posters, like, 'Do you have any information on this person?' and put them up in the area, and we usually get a flurry of tips like, 'Yeah, this person works here,' and so on and so on.\"\n\nBut like other Antifa groups across the country, the Portland sect gets the most attention when violence explodes at its rallies.\n\nAnd for that, its members don't apologize.\n\n\"You have to put your body in the way,\" the group's leader said, \"and you have to make it speak in the language that they understand. And sometimes that is violence.\"\n\nIt's a perspective several Antifa activists shared with CNN, even knowing that violence has led to hundreds of arrests across the country.\n\nCNN's Majlie Kamp and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

2017\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)On the morning of Donald Trump's inauguration, Keval Bhatt hunted through a closet in his parents' Virginia home for the darkest clothes he could find.\n\nThe 19-year-old didn't own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day.As Bhatt drove into the city for his first-ever protest, he hesitated.\"I thought, there's a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,\" Bhatt told CNN. \"But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people's lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.\"Bhatt joined protesters dressed completely in black, some with their faces covered by masks -- a tactic known as \"black bloc\" that aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities.Read MoreAnd with them, Bhatt got arrested. He was rounded up with more than 200 other people and charged with a felony for inciting a riot. He has said he didn't engage in any violence and has pleaded not guilty; an initial hearing is set for next month. A federal indictment charges individuals in the group with starting fires, property destruction and physical violence that erupted on the streets as the 45th President of the United States took his oath of office.Many of those arrested identified themselves as part of the Antifa movement. Its name derives from \"anti-fascist,\" and it has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the \"hard left\" -- an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Antifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism.While Antifa members don't fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society's fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don't conform to the traditional 9-to-5.And their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism -- as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.From Oregon to GermanyAnti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle, and then more recently during the Occupy Wall Street movement.But their profile has been rising. Antifa demonstrators have marched in more than a half dozen protests since Election Day in Portland, Oregon, according to police.Earlier this year, Antifa activists were among those who smashed windows and set fires during protests at the University of California, Berkeley, leading to the cancellation of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and withdrawal of Ann Coulter as speakers.Antifa activists were in New York City on May Day.When the son of Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was arrested in Minnesota in March after protesting at a pro-Trump rally, he was dressed in black bloc alongside a group of Antifa supporters. He faces misdemeanor charges and has not yet entered a plea, but will be in court next month. A Kaine spokesperson says he was peacefully protesting, and wasn't disruptive. And white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others -- who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive. A 20-year-old man who had attended the rally later used his car to ram a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one of them.Though counterprotesters deny it they are to blame for violence, Trump this week declared \"blame on both sides\" -- and has drawn intense criticism for his view. Indeed, over the past year, Antifa members have been involved in clashes across the country and the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama and Nebraska, and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. \"Anti-racists or anti-fascists are not a new phenomenon,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \"What I think is new is that they're more active both in making themselves prominent at violent rallies and also trying to bridge into the disenfranchised peaceful progressive movement.\"Bhatt went in Charlottesville, too, and was just about five feet away from the car that drove through the crowd, killing protester Heather Heyer, he said.Before that, he said, Antifa protesters were cheering in celebration for having disrupted the neo-Nazi message.\"We were marching down one of the streets, and energy was ecstatic,\" Bhatt said. \"We were marching and chanting and engaged in this huge act of solidarity. There was a moment I was at the front of this huge line of people, and we see this other huge group of people marching down another way, and when the two groups met, it felt like the entire city just erupted in cheers and roars.\"Spurred to action by TrumpAntifa is impossible to track. It isn't united through a national organization, and it cloaks itself in anonymity. In speaking to Antifa leaders across the country, CNN found very few who would take off their masks. Indeed, it took months to track down members willing to share their stories.Many are like Bhatt, a self-described government skeptic with liberal views who didn't find mainstream politics a good fit for him.So, he weighed his options.\"Before J20 (January 20, Inauguration Day) happened I was convinced I'd go to NASA or some university to research,\" Bhatt said. Now facing a criminal record, \"I don't know,\" he said. \"My efforts might be better suited by an organization that helps communities.\"The son of parents who immigrated from India, Bhatt is sure of one thing: He has no plans to stop protesting. \"There are people who were energized by Bernie (Sanders) that now are anarchists,\" said an organizer of the website It's Going Down, a newsblog for Antifa. \"People are freaked out by a Trump regime, freaked out by the far-right. A lot of people saw neo-Nazi symbols. There's a reason why people are becoming polarized. It's real-life stuff that's happening.\"Sanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against \"hard-left\" violence, saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley appearance, \"I don't like this.\"\"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall,\" Sanders said. \"But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.\"The organizer of It's Going Down said his website traffic has grown from a few hundred daily hits to between 10,000 and 40,000 hits on its best days.\"There's a crisis among the left,\" he said. \"And they're looking for alternatives outside of party structures. The anarchist movement is one that's working outside structures. ... People are excited about that.\"Like many young Antifa members who spoke with CNN, the turning point for Bhatt was when Trump in late 2015 ad-libbed a campaign remark toward a Black Lives Matter protester, saying he \"should have been roughed up.\" In another moment that has catalyzed Antifa members, Trump in February 2016 told a campaign crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to \"knock the crap out of\" protesters holding tomatoes, adding, \"I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\"There was a normalization of political violence which first started with regard to the Trump rallies,\" Levin said. \"Indeed, we saw alt-right people manhandling African-American protesters,\" he said, using a term many white-rights activists use to describe themselves. \"Then what happened is these fiery embers crossed the fire line, so now on the far-left they say the best way to resist is violence because they're out-gunned in this new era of President Trump.\"'This is self-defense'For almost three decades, Scott Crow was part of the Antifa movement. \"I fought (against) Nazis. I've had death threats. I've had guns drawn on me. I've drawn guns on fascists. I've been in altercations. I've smoke-bombed places,\" he said. \"I've done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years.\"Activists don black bloc, Crow said, as a means to an end. \"People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then, therefore, we are able to move more freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not,\" he said.And that means avoiding police, whom many Antifa members see as an enemy, as well as skirting the scrutiny Antifa activists often get from alt-right trolls on the Internet. Black bloc, one member told us, also unites the movement. \"Even though it only takes one person to break a window, it doesn't matter because the bloc moves together,\" said a 26-year-old named Maura, who wouldn't give her last name. In New York's Union Square on May Day, a masked member of the Antifa group Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council told CNN why he wore black bloc and waved a black flag.\"We cover our face because the Nazis will try to find out who we are. And that is a very bad thing because they harass people,\" he said. \"We're trying to stop them from organizing. ... When they organize, they kill people, they hurt people, they fight people. And we're the ones who are fighting back.\"It's a position taken by many Antifa activists: \"This is self-defense.\"Antifa activists often don't hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution.\"Violence against windows -- there's no such thing as violence against windows,\" a masked Antifa member in Union Square told CNN. \"Windows don't have -- they're not persons. And even when they are persons, the people we fight back against, they are evil. They are the living embodiment, they are the second coming of Hitler.\"Crow explained the ideology this way: \"Don't confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,\" echoing the words of John Adams.\"Each of us breaks the law every day. It's just that we make the conscious choice to do that,\" he said. Antifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren't physically attacking them. The movement, Crow said, sees alt-right hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have opted to meet violence with violence.Right or wrong, \"that's for history to decide,\" he said.But Levin argues the violence is giving ammunition to racists -- and is anathema to the Antifa mission. \"It's killing the cause -- it's not hurting it, it's killing it, and it will kill it,\" Levin said. \"We're ceding the moral high ground and ceding the spotlight to where it should be, which is shining the spotlight on the vile.\"Levin, who for decades has attended rallies at both extremes to study radical groups, said he put his own body between an Antifa member and a Klan member when Antifa protesters attacked with knives at a February 2016 a rally in Anaheim, California. \"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Levin said. \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized. That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\"Rubber bullets and pepper spray Nearly seven months after Trump's election, police in Portland, Oregon, geared up for the 10th protest since Election Day pitting the alt-right and \"hard left.\"On that day, June 4, police were coming off a violent May Day protest in which they watched Antifa activists run through the business district, destroying storefronts and setting fires. Before the June event, \"we saw on social media that there was a lot of threats being put back and forth that gave us a lot of concern about physical violence,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said.Hoping to keep June 4 from becoming another May Day, police created a human barricade. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder between two city squares -- one filled with alt-right groups, the other with Antifa activists.After a few hours, it seemed peace had won the day. But then police caught whispers that Antifa members were planning to push past police into the alt-right rally square.Officers moved in with rubber bullets, pepper spray and smoke bombs. They pushed the masked Antifa activists into a corner and detained them. Many shed their black clothing and left it on the streets as police decided whom to arrest.\"We did seize a large number of weapons or things that could be used as weapons,\" Simpson said. \"Everything from knives to brass knuckles to poles and sticks and bricks and bottles and road flares and chains. One hundred percent, they came geared up to fight if it would be allowed.\"Despite Portland's liberal reputation, it has a history of clashes between extreme groups on the right and left. Residents have gotten fed up with the escalating violence, Simpson said.\"It is new, and this, like, this rumble mentality of, 'I'm going to bring my friends, you're going bring your friends, and we're going to fight it out in the park' -- it's not something we've seen here,\" Simpson said. \"It's not good for the city. People are just frustrated by it. It's affecting their livability. It's affecting their business. It's affecting their commute.\"Law enforcement in several cities told CNN there's no excuse for the violence.\"The fires starting -- that we saw on May Day -- is something we haven't really seen much of in the past,\" Simpson said. \"The running through the street, breaking windows and everything in sight, we haven't seen it as consistently as we've seen it in the last eight months.\"In that time, more than 150 people have been arrested. They range in age from 14 to 66, police records show, and include several students, a cook, a franchise restaurant owner and a retail manager, a CNN review of arrestees' social media accounts found.On social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found.In Berkeley, Antifa and alt-right activists have clashed several times since Election Day. Police say they haven't seen anything like this since the '60s.And in jurisdictions across the country, police told CNN they've started enforcing with new vigor laws that bar people from wearing masks during gatherings. For that reason, many Antifa members in Charlottesville did not wear masks, Bhatt said.\"It feels to me like there's a struggle in the country ... of the different kinds of speech and what's OK to say and what's not OK,\" Simpson said. \"But one thing is very clear is that free speech and protected speech can be very offensive and very hateful, but it's still not a crime.\"'Put your body in the way'With no central leader, Antifa adherents have found each other in local communities. They communicate and recruit largely through social media. Their protests are organized via Facebook. And of late, in active areas, monthly meetings have increased in frequency to several times each week. Activists take martial arts classes together and strategize about how to achieve their main goal: taking down fascists. In Portland, where the Rose City Antifa has been active for a decade, members focus on outing people they believe are neo-Nazis, even trying to get them fired and evicted from their homes.\"We've done mass mailings.

Keval Bhatt hunted through a closet in his parents' Virginia home for the darkest clothes he could find.\n\nThe 19-year-old didn't own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day.\n\nAs Bhatt drove into the city for his first-ever protest, he hesitated.\n\n\"I thought, there's a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,\" Bhatt told CNN. \"But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people's lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.\"\n\nBhatt joined protesters dressed completely in black, some with their faces covered by masks -- a tactic known as \"black bloc\" that aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities.\n\nAnd with them, Bhatt got arrested.\n\nHe was rounded up with more than 200 other people and charged with a felony for inciting a riot. He has said he didn't engage in any violence and has pleaded not guilty; an initial hearing is set for next month. A federal indictment charges individuals in the group with starting fires, property destruction and physical violence that erupted on the streets as the 45th President of the United States took his oath of office.\n\nMany of those arrested identified themselves as part of the Antifa movement. Its name derives from \"anti-fascist,\" and it has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the \"hard left\" -- an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites.\n\nAntifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism.\n\nWhile Antifa members don't fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society's fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don't conform to the traditional 9-to-5.\n\nAnd their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism -- as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.\n\nFrom Oregon to Germany\n\nAnti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle, and then more recently during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nBut their profile has been rising.\n\nAntifa demonstrators have marched in more than a half dozen protests since Election Day in Portland, Oregon, according to police.\n\nEarlier this year, Antifa activists were among those who smashed windows and set fires during protests at the University of California, Berkeley, leading to the cancellation of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and withdrawal of Ann Coulter as speakers.\n\nAntifa activists were in New York City on May Day.\n\nWhen the son of Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was arrested in Minnesota in March after protesting at a pro-Trump rally, he was dressed in black bloc alongside a group of Antifa supporters. He faces misdemeanor charges and has not yet entered a plea, but will be in court next month. A Kaine spokesperson says he was peacefully protesting, and wasn't disruptive.\n\nAnd white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others -- who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive. A 20-year-old man who had attended the rally later used his car to ram a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one of them.\n\nThough counterprotesters deny it they are to blame for violence, Trump this week declared \"blame on both sides\" -- and has drawn intense criticism for his view.\n\nIndeed, over the past year, Antifa members have been involved in clashes across the country and the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama and Nebraska, and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\"Anti-racists or anti-fascists are not a new phenomenon,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \"What I think is new is that they're more active both in making themselves prominent at violent rallies and also trying to bridge into the disenfranchised peaceful progressive movement.\"\n\nBhatt went in Charlottesville, too, and was just about five feet away from the car that drove through the crowd, killing protester Heather Heyer, he said.\n\nBefore that, he said, Antifa protesters were cheering in celebration for having disrupted the neo-Nazi message.\n\n\"We were marching down one of the streets, and energy was ecstatic,\" Bhatt said. \"We were marching and chanting and engaged in this huge act of solidarity. There was a moment I was at the front of this huge line of people, and we see this other huge group of people marching down another way, and when the two groups met, it felt like the entire city just erupted in cheers and roars.\"\n\nSpurred to action by Trump\n\nAntifa is impossible to track. It isn't united through a national organization, and it cloaks itself in anonymity.\n\nIn speaking to Antifa leaders across the country, CNN found very few who would take off their masks. Indeed, it took months to track down members willing to share their stories.\n\nMany are like Bhatt, a self-described government skeptic with liberal views who didn't find mainstream politics a good fit for him.\n\nSo, he weighed his options.\n\n\"Before J20 (January 20, Inauguration Day) happened I was convinced I'd go to NASA or some university to research,\" Bhatt said.\n\nNow facing a criminal record, \"I don't know,\" he said. \"My efforts might be better suited by an organization that helps communities.\"\n\nThe son of parents who immigrated from India, Bhatt is sure of one thing: He has no plans to stop protesting.\n\n\"There are people who were energized by Bernie (Sanders) that now are anarchists,\" said an organizer of the website It's Going Down, a newsblog for Antifa. \"People are freaked out by a Trump regime, freaked out by the far-right. A lot of people saw neo-Nazi symbols. There's a reason why people are becoming polarized. It's real-life stuff that's happening.\"\n\nSanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against \"hard-left\" violence, saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley appearance, \"I don't like this.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall,\" Sanders said. \"But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.\"\n\nThe organizer of It's Going Down said his website traffic has grown from a few hundred daily hits to between 10,000 and 40,000 hits on its best days.\n\n\"There's a crisis among the left,\" he said. \"And they're looking for alternatives outside of party structures. The anarchist movement is one that's working outside structures. ... People are excited about that.\"\n\nLike many young Antifa members who spoke with CNN, the turning point for Bhatt was when Trump in late 2015 ad-libbed a campaign remark toward a Black Lives Matter protester, saying he \"should have been roughed up.\"\n\nIn another moment that has catalyzed Antifa members, Trump in February 2016 told a campaign crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to \"knock the crap out of\" protesters holding tomatoes, adding, \"I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\n\n\"There was a normalization of political violence which first started with regard to the Trump rallies,\" Levin said.\n\n\"Indeed, we saw alt-right people manhandling African-American protesters,\" he said, using a term many white-rights activists use to describe themselves. \"Then what happened is these fiery embers crossed the fire line, so now on the far-left they say the best way to resist is violence because they're out-gunned in this new era of President Trump.\"\n\n'This is self-defense'\n\nFor almost three decades, Scott Crow was part of the Antifa movement.\n\n\"I fought (against) Nazis. I've had death threats. I've had guns drawn on me. I've drawn guns on fascists. I've been in altercations. I've smoke-bombed places,\" he said. \"I've done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years.\"\n\nActivists don black bloc, Crow said, as a means to an end.\n\n\"People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then, therefore, we are able to move more freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not,\" he said.\n\nAnd that means avoiding police, whom many Antifa members see as an enemy, as well as skirting the scrutiny Antifa activists often get from alt-right trolls on the Internet. Black bloc, one member told us, also unites the movement.\n\n\"Even though it only takes one person to break a window, it doesn't matter because the bloc moves together,\" said a 26-year-old named Maura, who wouldn't give her last name.\n\nIn New York's Union Square on May Day, a masked member of the Antifa group Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council told CNN why he wore black bloc and waved a black flag.\n\n\"We cover our face because the Nazis will try to find out who we are. And that is a very bad thing because they harass people,\" he said. \"We're trying to stop them from organizing. ... When they organize, they kill people, they hurt people, they fight people. And we're the ones who are fighting back.\"\n\nIt's a position taken by many Antifa activists: \"This is self-defense.\"\n\nAntifa activists often don't hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution.\n\n\"Violence against windows -- there's no such thing as violence against windows,\" a masked Antifa member in Union Square told CNN. \"Windows don't have -- they're not persons. And even when they are persons, the people we fight back against, they are evil. They are the living embodiment, they are the second coming of Hitler.\"\n\nCrow explained the ideology this way: \"Don't confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,\" echoing the words of John Adams.\n\n\"Each of us breaks the law every day. It's just that we make the conscious choice to do that,\" he said.\n\nAntifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren't physically attacking them. The movement, Crow said, sees alt-right hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have opted to meet violence with violence.\n\nRight or wrong, \"that's for history to decide,\" he said.\n\nBut Levin argues the violence is giving ammunition to racists -- and is anathema to the Antifa mission.\n\n\"It's killing the cause -- it's not hurting it, it's killing it, and it will kill it,\" Levin said. \"We're ceding the moral high ground and ceding the spotlight to where it should be, which is shining the spotlight on the vile.\"\n\nLevin, who for decades has attended rallies at both extremes to study radical groups, said he put his own body between an Antifa member and a Klan member when Antifa protesters attacked with knives at a February 2016 a rally in Anaheim, California.\n\n\"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Levin said. \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized. That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\"\n\nRubber bullets and pepper spray\n\nNearly seven months after Trump's election, police in Portland, Oregon, geared up for the 10th protest since Election Day pitting the alt-right and \"hard left.\"\n\nOn that day, June 4, police were coming off a violent May Day protest in which they watched Antifa activists run through the business district, destroying storefronts and setting fires.\n\nBefore the June event, \"we saw on social media that there was a lot of threats being put back and forth that gave us a lot of concern about physical violence,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said.\n\nHoping to keep June 4 from becoming another May Day, police created a human barricade. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder between two city squares -- one filled with alt-right groups, the other with Antifa activists.\n\nAfter a few hours, it seemed peace had won the day. But then police caught whispers that Antifa members were planning to push past police into the alt-right rally square.\n\nOfficers moved in with rubber bullets, pepper spray and smoke bombs. They pushed the masked Antifa activists into a corner and detained them. Many shed their black clothing and left it on the streets as police decided whom to arrest.\n\n\"We did seize a large number of weapons or things that could be used as weapons,\" Simpson said. \"Everything from knives to brass knuckles to poles and sticks and bricks and bottles and road flares and chains. One hundred percent, they came geared up to fight if it would be allowed.\"\n\nDespite Portland's liberal reputation, it has a history of clashes between extreme groups on the right and left. Residents have gotten fed up with the escalating violence, Simpson said.\n\n\"It is new, and this, like, this rumble mentality of, 'I'm going to bring my friends, you're going bring your friends, and we're going to fight it out in the park' -- it's not something we've seen here,\" Simpson said. \"It's not good for the city. People are just frustrated by it. It's affecting their livability. It's affecting their business. It's affecting their commute.\"\n\nLaw enforcement in several cities told CNN there's no excuse for the violence.\n\n\"The fires starting -- that we saw on May Day -- is something we haven't really seen much of in the past,\" Simpson said. \"The running through the street, breaking windows and everything in sight, we haven't seen it as consistently as we've seen it in the last eight months.\"\n\nIn that time, more than 150 people have been arrested. They range in age from 14 to 66, police records show, and include several students, a cook, a franchise restaurant owner and a retail manager, a CNN review of arrestees' social media accounts found.\n\nOn social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found.\n\nIn Berkeley, Antifa and alt-right activists have clashed several times since Election Day. Police say they haven't seen anything like this since the '60s.\n\nAnd in jurisdictions across the country, police told CNN they've started enforcing with new vigor laws that bar people from wearing masks during gatherings. For that reason, many Antifa members in Charlottesville did not wear masks, Bhatt said.\n\n\"It feels to me like there's a struggle in the country ... of the different kinds of speech and what's OK to say and what's not OK,\" Simpson said. \"But one thing is very clear is that free speech and protected speech can be very offensive and very hateful, but it's still not a crime.\"\n\n'Put your body in the way'\n\nWith no central leader, Antifa adherents have found each other in local communities. They communicate and recruit largely through social media. Their protests are organized via Facebook.\n\nAnd of late, in active areas, monthly meetings have increased in frequency to several times each week. Activists take martial arts classes together and strategize about how to achieve their main goal: taking down fascists.\n\nIn Portland, where the Rose City Antifa has been active for a decade, members focus on outing people they believe are neo-Nazis, even trying to get them fired and evicted from their homes.\n\n\"We've done mass mailings. We've even gone door to door before in communities,\" said the group's leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We've gone out to areas that we know that a lot of Nazis live with, like, 'wanted' posters, like, 'Do you have any information on this person?' and put them up in the area, and we usually get a flurry of tips like, 'Yeah, this person works here,' and so on and so on.\"\n\nBut like other Antifa groups across the country, the Portland sect gets the most attention when violence explodes at its rallies.\n\nAnd for that, its members don't apologize.\n\n\"You have to put your body in the way,\" the group's leader said, \"and you have to make it speak in the language that they understand.

own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day.\n\nAs Bhatt drove into the city for his first-ever protest, he hesitated.\n\n\"I thought, there's a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,\" Bhatt told CNN. \"But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people's lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.\"\n\nBhatt joined protesters dressed completely in black, some with their faces covered by masks -- a tactic known as \"black bloc\" that aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities.\n\nAnd with them, Bhatt got arrested.\n\nHe was rounded up with more than 200 other people and charged with a felony for inciting a riot. He has said he didn't engage in any violence and has pleaded not guilty. A federal indictment charges individuals in the group with starting fires, property destruction and physical violence that erupted on the streets as the 45th President of the United States took his oath of office.\n\nMany of those arrested identified themselves as part of the Antifa movement. Its name derives from \"anti-fascist,\" and it has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the \"hard left\" -- an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites.\n\nAntifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism.\n\nWhile Antifa members don't fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society's fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don't conform to the traditional 9-to-5.\n\nAnd their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism -- as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.\n\nAnti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle, and then more recently during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nBut their profile has been rising.\n\nAntifa demonstrators have marched in more than a half dozen protests since Election Day in Portland, Oregon, according to police.\n\nEarlier this year, Antifa activists were among those who smashed windows and set fires during protests at the University of California, Berkeley, leading to the cancellation of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and withdrawal of Ann Coulter as speakers.\n\nAntifa activists were in New York City on May Day.\n\nWhen the son of Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was arrested in Minnesota in March after protesting at a pro-Trump rally, he was dressed in black bloc alongside a group of Antifa supporters. He faces misdemeanor charges and has not yet entered a plea but will be in court next month. A Kaine spokesperson said he was peacefully protesting, and wasn't disruptive.\n\nAnd white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others -- who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive. A 20-year-old man who had attended the rally later used his car to ram a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one of them.\n\nThough counterprotesters deny they are to blame for violence, Trump this week declared \"blame on both sides\" -- and has drawn intense criticism for his view.\n\nIndeed, over the past year, Antifa members have been involved in clashes across the country and the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama and Nebraska, and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\"Anti-racists or anti-fascists are not a new phenomenon,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \"What I think is new is that they're more active both in making themselves prominent at violent rallies and also trying to bridge into the disenfranchised peaceful progressive movement.\"\n\nBhatt went in Charlottesville, too, and was just about five feet away from the car that drove through the crowd, killing protester Heather Heyer, he said.\n\nBefore that, he said, Antifa protesters were cheering in celebration for having disrupted the neo-Nazi message.\n\n\"We were marching down one of the streets, and energy was ecstatic,\" Bhatt said. \"We were marching and chanting and engaged in this huge act of solidarity. There was a moment I was at the front of this huge line of people, and we see this other huge group of people marching down another way, and when the two groups met, it felt like the entire city just erupted in cheers and roars.\"\n\nAntifa is impossible to track. It isn't united through a national organization, and it cloaks itself in anonymity.\n\nIn speaking to Antifa leaders across the country, CNN found very few who would take off their masks. Indeed, it took months to track down members willing to share their stories.\n\nMany are like Bhatt, a self-described government skeptic with liberal views who didn't find mainstream politics a good fit for him.\n\nSo, he weighed his options.\n\n\"Before J20 (January 20, Inauguration Day) happened I was convinced I'd go to NASA or some university to research,\" Bhatt said.\n\nNow facing a criminal record, \"I don't know,\" he said. \"My efforts might be better suited by an organization that helps communities.\"\n\nThe son of parents who immigrated from India, Bhatt is sure of one thing: He has no plans to stop protesting.\n\n\"There are people who were energized by Bernie (Sanders) that now are anarchists,\" said an organizer of the website It's Going Down, a newsblog for Antifa. \"People are freaked out by a Trump regime, freaked out by the far-right. A lot of people saw neo-Nazi symbols. There's a reason why people are becoming polarized. It's real-life stuff that's happening.\"\n\nSanders, for his part, has disavowed violence and is not connected with Antifa efforts. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has come out against \"hard-left\" violence, saying of protests over Coulter's UC Berkeley appearance, \"I don't like this.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Ann Coulter's outrageous -- to my mind, off the wall,\" Sanders said. \"But you know, people have a right to give their two cents' worth, give a speech, without fear of violence and intimidation.\"\n\nThe organizer of It's Going Down said his website traffic has grown from a few hundred daily hits to between 10,000 and 40,000 hits on its best days.\n\n\"There's a crisis among the left,\" he said. \"And they're looking for alternatives outside of party structures. The anarchist movement is one that's working outside structures. ... People are excited about that.\"\n\nLike many young Antifa members who spoke with CNN, the turning point for Bhatt was when Trump in late 2015 ad-libbed a campaign remark toward a Black Lives Matter protester, saying he \"should have been roughed up.\"\n\nIn another moment that has catalyzed Antifa members, Trump in February 2016 told a campaign crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to \"knock the crap out of\" protesters holding tomatoes, adding, \"I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\n\n\"There was a normalization of political violence which first started with regard to the Trump rallies,\" Levin said.\n\n\"Indeed, we saw alt-right people manhandling African-American protesters,\" he said, using a term many white-rights activists use to describe themselves. \"Then what happened is these fiery embers crossed the fire line, so now on the far-left they say the best way to resist is violence because they're out-gunned in this new era of President Trump.\"\n\nFor almost three decades, Scott Crow was part of the Antifa movement.\n\n\"I fought (against) Nazis. I've had death threats. I've had guns drawn on me. I've drawn guns on fascists. I've been in altercations. I've smoke-bombed places,\" he said. \"I've done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years.\"\n\nActivists don black bloc, Crow said, as a means to an end.\n\n\"People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then, therefore, we are able to move more freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not,\" he said.\n\nAnd that means avoiding police, whom many Antifa members see as an enemy, as well as skirting the scrutiny Antifa activists often get from alt-right trolls on the Internet. Black bloc, one member told us, also unites the movement.\n\n\"Even though it only takes one person to break a window, it doesn't matter because the bloc moves together,\" said a 26-year-old named Maura, who wouldn't give her last name.\n\nIn New York's Union Square on May Day, a masked member of the Antifa group Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council told CNN why he wore black bloc and waved a black flag.\n\n\"We cover our face because the Nazis will try to find out who we are. And that is a very bad thing because they harass people,\" he said. \"We're trying to stop them from organizing. ... When they organize, they kill people, they hurt people, they fight people. And we're the ones who are fighting back.\"\n\nIt's a position taken by many Antifa activists: \"This is self-defense.\"\n\nAntifa activists often don't hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution.\n\n\"Violence against windows -- there's no such thing as violence against windows,\" a masked Antifa member in Union Square told CNN. \"Windows don't have -- they're not persons. And even when they are persons, the people we fight back against, they are evil. They are the living embodiment, they are the second coming of Hitler.\"\n\nCrow explained the ideology this way: \"Don't confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,\" echoing the words of John Adams.\n\n\"Each of us breaks the law every day. It's just that we make the conscious choice to do that,\" he said.\n\nAntifa members also sometimes launch attacks against people who aren't physically attacking them. The movement, Crow said, sees alt-right hate speech as violent, and for that, its activists have opted to meet violence with violence.\n\nRight or wrong, \"that's for history to decide,\" he said.\n\nBut Levin argues the violence is giving ammunition to racists -- and is anathema to the Antifa mission.\n\n\"It's killing the cause -- it's not hurting it, it's killing it, and it will kill it,\" Levin said. \"We're ceding the moral high ground and ceding the spotlight to where it should be, which is shining the spotlight on the vile.\"\n\nLevin, who for decades has attended rallies at both extremes to study radical groups, said he put his own body between an Antifa member and a Klan member when Antifa protesters attacked with knives at a February 2016 a rally in Anaheim, California.\n\n\"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Levin said. \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized. That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\"\n\nNearly seven months after Trump's election, police in Portland, Oregon, geared up for the 10th protest since Election Day pitting the alt-right and \"hard left.\"\n\nOn that day, June 4, police were coming off a violent May Day protest in which they watched Antifa activists run through the business district, destroying storefronts and setting fires.\n\nBefore the June event, \"we saw on social media that there was a lot of threats being put back and forth that gave us a lot of concern about physical violence,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said.\n\nHoping to keep June 4 from becoming another May Day, police created a human barricade. Officers stood shoulder to shoulder between two city squares -- one filled with alt-right groups, the other with Antifa activists.\n\nAfter a few hours, it seemed peace had won the day. But then police caught whispers that Antifa members were planning to push past police into the alt-right rally square.\n\nOfficers moved in with rubber bullets, pepper spray and smoke bombs. They pushed the masked Antifa activists into a corner and detained them. Many shed their black clothing and left it on the streets as police decided whom to arrest.\n\n\"We did seize a large number of weapons or things that could be used as weapons,\" Simpson said. \"Everything from knives to brass knuckles to poles and sticks and bricks and bottles and road flares and chains. One hundred percent, they came geared up to fight if it would be allowed.\"\n\nDespite Portland's liberal reputation, it has a history of clashes between extreme groups on the right and left. Residents have gotten fed up with the escalating violence, Simpson said.\n\n\"It is new, and this, like, this rumble mentality of, 'I'm going to bring my friends, you're going bring your friends, and we're going to fight it out in the park' -- it's not something we've seen here,\" Simpson said. \"It's not good for the city. People are just frustrated by it. It's affecting their livability. It's affecting their business. It's affecting their commute.\"\n\nLaw enforcement in several cities told CNN there's no excuse for the violence.\n\n\"The fires starting -- that we saw on May Day -- is something we haven't really seen much of in the past,\" Simpson said. \"The running through the street, breaking windows and everything in sight, we haven't seen it as consistently as we've seen it in the last eight months.\"\n\nIn that time, more than 150 people have been arrested. They range in age from 14 to 66, police records show, and include several students, a cook, a franchise restaurant owner and a retail manager, a CNN review of arrestees' social media accounts found.\n\nOn social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found.\n\nIn Berkeley, Antifa and alt-right activists have clashed several times since Election Day. Police say they haven't seen anything like this since the '60s.\n\nAnd in jurisdictions across the country, police told CNN they've started enforcing with new vigor laws that bar people from wearing masks during gatherings. For that reason, many Antifa members in Charlottesville did not wear masks, Bhatt said.\n\n\"It feels to me like there's a struggle in the country ... of the different kinds of speech and what's OK to say and what's not OK,\" Simpson said. \"But one thing is very clear is that free speech and protected speech can be very offensive and very hateful, but it's still not a crime.\"\n\nWith no central leader, Antifa adherents have found each other in local communities. They communicate and recruit largely through social media. Their protests are organized via Facebook.\n\nAnd of late, in active areas, monthly meetings have increased in frequency to several times each week. Activists take martial arts classes together and strategize about how to achieve their main goal: taking down fascists.\n\nIn Portland, where the Rose City Antifa has been active for a decade, members focus on outing people they believe are neo-Nazis, even trying to get them fired and evicted from their homes.\n\n\"We've done mass mailings. We've even gone door to door before in communities,\" said the group's leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We've gone out to areas that we know that a lot of Nazis live with, like, 'wanted' posters, like, 'Do you have any information on this person?' and put them up in the area, and we usually get a flurry of tips like, 'Yeah, this person works here,' and so on and so on.\"\n\nBut like other Antifa groups across the country, the Portland sect gets the most attention when violence explodes at its rallies.\n\nAnd for that, its members don't apologize.\n\n\"You have to put your body in the way,\" the group's leader said, \"and you have to make it speak in the language that they understand. And sometimes that is violence.\"\n\nIt's a perspective several Antifa activists shared with CNN, even knowing that violence has led to hundreds of arrests across the country.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3372960", "id": "10102257", "url": "http://ktla.com/2017/08/19/unmasking-the-antifa-movement-left-wing-activists-seek-peace-through-violence/", "sim": 0.929411768913269, "details": {}, "uri": "712019240", "extractedDates": [{"date": "-01-20", "textStart": 6011, "textEnd": 6021, "amb": false}, {"date": "-06-04", "textStart": 12167, "textEnd": 12173, "amb": false, "freq": 2}, {"date": "2016-02-", "textStart": 7841, "textEnd": 7854, "amb": false, "freq": 2}], "eventUri": "eng-3372960", "image": "https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s082501691.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=640", "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:45:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Unmasking the Anti-Fascist Movement: Left-Wing Activists Seek Peace Through Violence", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "id": 121}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "id": 232}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "id": 333}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "id": 334}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705}], "time": "19:45:00", "source": {"uri": "ktla.com", "title": "KTLA", "id": "2653"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

to media reports and eyewitness accounts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not specify radicals who operate under the banner of Antifa, an abbreviation for anti-fascist or anti-fascist action, when he said Tuesday that \"both sides\" bore responsibility for the violence and bloodshed that left three dead and dozens injured.\n\nIt is hard to know at this juncture how many of the hundreds of counterprotesters considered themselves affiliated with Antifa. Nor is it clear how many of them were among those who squared off against the white supremacists marching in downtown Charlottesville, trading punches and blows, some with lengths of wood.\n\nThe full facts await the findings of a Justice Department investigation of the Charlottesville violence announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n\"Antifa is a coalition of hyperviolent activists who are far-left anarchists or communists,\" said Matthew Vadum, senior vice president at the Washington-based Capital Research Center. \"They could be considered domestic terrorists. They are not legitimate actors in the democratic process.\"\n\nFox News Channel's Doug McKelway, on the scene in Charlottesville, was among reporters who described individuals in clashing groups wearing helmets and padded clothes, carrying shields, and brandishing lengths of wood.\n\nInitially, the network of radical activists did not attract as much media attention as the white nationalists and neo-Nazis they were confronting, but this has begun to change.\n\nThis short video from the pro-Trump outlet Very Fake News, which contains strong language, documents some Antifa members' behavior toward media organizations reporting on events in Charlottesville:\n\nThe liberal media outlet Slate, however, reported that clergy and other peaceful protesters of the white supremacists credited Antifa activists with trying to protect them from violence.\n\nAbsurd Suggestions\n\nThere is no cohesive, centralized structure to Antifa. Instead, it appears to be set up as a network of anarchists, communists, and socialists who say they are opposed to \"racism, sexism, homophobia, and capitalism\" and take inspiration from a European movement in the 1930s called Anti-Fascist Action, as The Economist explains in a brief profile:\n\nAntifa groups are not as widespread as they might seem. Their lack of coordination and endorsement of violence hinders their appeal as a mass movement. In America, their ongoing guerrilla war with the alt-right has helped bring more publicity to white supremacists and nationalists while doing little to advance their (somewhat unclear) cause.\n\nPrior to its clashes with white supremacists in Virginia, Antifa -- often rendered in lowercase as antifa-gained some notoriety June 4 after confronting Trump supporters in Portland, Oregon, which resulted in violent clashes.\n\nAntifa allegedly had a hand in threatening violence against Portland's 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association if the business group allowed the Multnomah County Republican Party to participate in its annual Rose Festival. The business group canceled the event.\n\nArthur Milikh, associate director of the B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal in an interview that Antifa has avoided spelling out its positions and goals in an effort to evade scrutiny.\n\n\"They have been very careful to avoid laying out what precisely they desire to obtain, or what fascism means,\" Milikh said. \"Whatever one may think of President Trump, his rhetoric, or his policies, it's absurd to suggest that he intends to or could dissolve Congress, cancel elections, shred the Constitution, and name himself dictator, as a fascist would.\"\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Peter Beinart -- who has written before about Antifa in an essay titled \"The Rise of the Violent Left\" -- suggests that adherents are hard to pin down, noting:\n\nAntifa activists are sincere. They genuinely believe that their actions protect vulnerable people from harm. Cornel West claims they did so in Charlottesville. But for all of Antifa's supposed anti-authoritarianism, there's something fundamentally authoritarian about its claim that its activists -- who no one elected -- can decide whose views are too odious to be publicly expressed. That kind of undemocratic, illegitimate power corrupts.\n\nBeinart points to Portland's Rose Festival confrontation as an example.\n\nMuzzling Milo at UC Berkeley\n\nAntifa has been connected with other far-left organizations such as one with the unwieldy name of Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, & Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary, or BAMN.\n\nAntifa activists sometimes stand out from the pack by dressing \"head to toe\" in black, a style and tactic known as \"Black Bloc.\"\n\nAntifa has operated with a heightened profile since Trump's election. During official festivities surrounding Inauguration Day in Washington, Antifa was part of anti-Trump protests and engaged in destruction of property, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn February, Antifa activists took part in fiery protests at and around the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n>>> In Photos, the Latest Example of Liberal 'Tolerance'\n\nAntifa joined with others to aggressively oppose a scheduled appearance at UC Berkeley by Milo Yiannopoulos, a British-born libertarian commentator, making Antifa part of the movement to suppress free speech on college campuses.\n\nCNN reported:\n\nBlack-clad protesters wearing masks threw commercial-grade fireworks and rocks at police. Some even hurled Molotov cocktails that ignited fires. They also smashed windows of the student union center on the Berkeley campus where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.\n\nUC Berkeley, which reported $100,000 in damages, canceled that speech.\n\n'Stir Up the Debate'\n\nIn many respects, Antifa appears to exist mostly as a conduit for social media organizing strategies, as opposed to a single organization. Using Facebook, Twitter, and other tools, the network attracts participants in its activities, including its role in the Berkeley protest and the counterprotest in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Economist notes:\n\nThe biggest impact of American Antifa groups has been to stir up the debate on free speech through their insistence on preventing so-called fascists from expressing themselves, such as at Berkeley in February, where Antifa groups staged violent protests against Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur. Shutting down speech is hardly anti-fascist.\n\n>>> Trump Protesters Vow to 'Shut Down' Inauguration\n\nCoverage of Antifa appears to focus narrowly on its opposition to white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations, but a significant number of Antifa members appear to regard Trump and the Republican Party as fascist and racist.\n\nA growing number of videos supporting and attacking Antifa pop up on YouTube and other social media outlets, including this example, a 10-minute video in which two masked young members call themselves socialists.\n\nIn an Aug. 8 post about Antifa on the Capital Research Center's website, four days before the violence in Charlottesville, Jacob Grandstaff wrote:\n\nIn Sacramento, California in June 2016, hundreds of Antifa rioters attacked 30-odd members of the white nationalist Traditional Workers Party (TWP). Although Capital Research Center does not support the goals of the TWP, the group had obtained a lawful permit to demonstrate when Antifa protesters violently refused to to allow the group to express its First Amendment rights. In the ensuing melee, 14 people received stab wounds, and two were sent to the hospital in critical condition (they both survived).\n\nConservative political commentator Ben Shapiro posted a video Thursday questioning the left's embrace of Antifa, which he calls \"a violent, communist, anarchist organization\":\n\nAntifa's source of funds is as murky as its leadership.\n\nThe Capital Research Center's Vadum told The Daily Signal that the Alliance for Global Justice, associated with hedge fund manager and leftist financier George Soros, \"acts as fiscal sponsor for Antifa groups.\"\n\nHeritage's Milikh described two main tactics the left has employed against the Trump administration.\n\n\"Since the left currently controls neither Congress nor the White House,\" he said, \"they decided they will try to rule the public mind and preserve their own power and respectability through two means.\"\n\nThe first tactic is to propagate and circulate accusations, Milikh said.\n\n\"Right now, they have no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,\" he said. \"But they have made it their biggest issue, which is used to undermine the president's powers by turning public opinion against him.\"\n\nThe second tactic is \"deploying well-organized and well-funded protests on the ground,\" Milikh said, adding:\n\nProtests are often successful for the left because a willing press often assists their cause by leaving the impression that the entire country -- not just a handful of protesters -- is vibrating with anger. This in turn teaches viewers the lesson that the bigger and angrier the crowd, the more just their cause. This tactic aims to prevent serious, reasoned public deliberation and debate.\n\n'Cultural Resistance'\n\nThe New York City branch of the Antifa network says on its website that it is keen on using social media to galvanize support.\n\n\"NYC ANTIFA is an autonomous blog that is trying through different media (news, videos, and information in general) [to] help to build, defend, educate, and create an effective cultural resistance against fascism,\" the website says.\n\nThe New York group recently marked its third annual International Day of Solidarity With Antifascist Prisoners, an event detailed and described on its website:\n\nThe July 25 International Day of Solidarity With Antifascist Prisoners originated in 2014 as the Day of Solidarity with Jock Palfreeman, an Australian man serving a 20-year sentence in Bulgaria for defending two Romani men being attacked by fascist football hooligans. Whether acting as individuals or as part of larger organized demonstrations, this is the kind of bravery and solidarity which defines antifascist actions against the forces of hate.\n\nSince the day of solidarity last year, we have seen this spirit all over the world -- in Indonesia, Czech Republic, Brazil, Poland, England, Greece, the United States, France, Syria, Australia, Japan, and all points in between.\n\nAmong the fringe groups on the right participating in the so-called \"Unite the Right\" event in Charlottesville, as chronicled on Wikipedia, were clubs of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, the neo-Confederate League of the South, the National Policy Institute, and the National Socialist Movement. Other involved groups include the Ku Klux Klan, the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, the Traditionalist Workers Party, Vanguard America, the American Guard, the Virginia Minutemen Militia, the Nationalist Front, and Anti-Communist Action.\n\nAmong liberal and leftist groups identified on Wikipedia as on hand in Charlottesville were Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Anti-Racist Action, the Democratic Socialists of America, the Workers World Party, the Revolutionary Communist Party, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council, Redneck Revolt, and Showing Up for Racial Justice.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3372960", "id": "9803036", "url": "http://dailysignal.com/2017/08/17/far-left-antifa-agitators-on-the-rise-in-the-age-of-trump/", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "details": {}, "uri": "711189191", "extractedDates": [{"date": "-06-04", "textStart": 2878, "textEnd": 2884, "amb": false}, {"date": "2017-08-08", "textEnd": 7177, "textStart": 7171, "imp": true, "amb": false}, {"date": "2017-07-25", "textEnd": 9955, "textStart": 9948, "imp": true, "amb": false}, {"date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 7342, "textEnd": 7351, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3372960", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/170817_Antifa_Mooney.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T01:04:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Far-Left 'Antifa' Agitators on the Rise in the Age of Trump", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "id": 277}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "id": 333}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "id": 334}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "id": 1226}], "time": "01:04:00", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "title": "The Daily Signal", "id": "6349"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

But get used to Antifa, because you'll be hearing about them over and over again.\n\nThe Antifa movement is on the rise in the wake of Charlottesville.\n\nTwo dead and several injured after man goes on knife rampage in Finland\n\nThey have been out in force reclaiming the streets after white supremacists marched and left one woman dead and dozens injured over the weekend. Think of them of furthest thing away from members of the KKK and neo-Nazis.\n\nTheir goal is to end fascism globally and fight white supremacy.\n\nBut the problem is, they're so far left their cause is usually thrown into the mixing pot of violence at big rallies. Officials would have you believe they're part of the problem.\n\nThey take matters into their own hands and are usually communists, socialists and anarchists. They go a step further than liberal anti-racists by seeking out organized fascist events and trying to shut them down.\n\nThere are Antifa groups across the entire country. But the there is no one headquarters, and they do not move and organize as one entity.\n\nThe Antifa has gained notoriety since Charlottesville after Donald Trump basically equated them to white supremacists.\n\nDuring a heated press conference earlier this week, he said he knew some 'very fine people' on either side.\n\nHe fanned flames by saying: 'What about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right. Do they have any semblance of guilt?'\n\n'You had a group on one side and a group on the other and they had clubs and they came at each other.'", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3372960", "id": "9946983", "url": "http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/18/what-is-the-antifa-movement-6862855/", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "details": {}, "uri": "711578449", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 66, "textEnd": 77, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3372960", "image": "https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pri_49509325-e1503076277580.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "timeCrawl": "17:36:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:36:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "What is the Antifa movement?", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "id": 150}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "id": 277}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "id": 300}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "id": 333}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "id": 773}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "id": 1226}], "time": "17:36:00", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "title": "Metro.co.uk", "id": "218"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

(RONEN ZVULUN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLess than three months ago, President Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, one of holiest sites in Judaism.\n\nWearing a black yarmulke, Trump laid his hand on the wall, closed his eyes, and prayed \"for wisdom from God.\"\n\nOn the trip, he was accompanied by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, and daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism in 2009.\n\nThree months later, in the aftermath of deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, media organizations, pundits, and politicians are claiming that the president is empowering neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nA man who has shown such respect and openness to Judaism is accused of supporting the very ideology that saw an estimated 6 million Jews brutally murdered in the Holocaust.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Aug. 15, at Trump Tower, the president condemned neo-Nazis three times and white nationalists twice.\n\n\"They should be condemned totally,\" the president said.\n\nJust a day before, the president gave a statement in which he said that \"racism is evil\" and that \"those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nTrump's firm stance against racism is not surprising, as he is a firm believer in the very documents that founded this nation. By definition, the Declaration of Independence opposed any divisions between men, as it stated that all men were created equally by God.\n\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" are the words immortalized in the Declaration.\n\nToward the end of his inaugural address in January, Trump echoed the Declaration's principle of divinely created equality when he said, \"And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\"\n\nIn his remarks on Aug. 15, the president also marked the tragic death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car driven by someone believed to be a neo-Nazi drove into left-wing protesters. Trump described Heyer as \"an incredible young woman.\"\n\nIn his remarks, however, Trump did not stop at condemning neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and their depraved ideology. He also said that there was blame on the other side.\n\nHe said that the other side had also acted violently and had come \"violently attacking the other group,\" while not having a permit to protest.\n\nThe president specifically called out the far-left Antifa extremist group, saying, \"You see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats.\"\n\nThe outrage that ensued was deafening. How could Trump blame both sides for the violence?\n\nRacism and fascism are repugnant ideologies that should be condemned and have no place in America or any place in the world. So what about \"the other side\" that Trump referred to?\n\nThe Antifa extremist group has its roots in 1920s Germany, where it was part of a Soviet front group with the goal of installing communist dictatorship in Germany.\n\nFollowing the successful revolution in Russia, the communists believed Germany would see the next revolution, as it had the second-largest communist party after Russia.\n\nThe Antifa group was the violent wing of Germany's KPD, the Communist Party of Germany, and operated under the umbrella of being against fascists.\n\nIn reality, the group labelled everyone who opposed its communist ideology as fascists. Ironically, the first fascist movement itself was founded by Benito Mussolini in Italy, a Marxist and Socialist who had been expelled from Italy's Socialist Party in 1914 for his support for World War I.\n\nIn the United States, the group has been involved in a number of violent protests this year. While it is true that Antifa opposes white nationalists, it also seeks to silence anyone it does not agree with. In February, the University of California-Berkeley was forced to cancel a speech by controversial right-wing speaker Milo Yiannopoulos after members of the group, dressed in all black, set fires and smashed university buildings. In April, conservative author Ann Coulter was forced to cancel a speech at the university following threats of violence by Antifa and other left-wing groups.\n\nBerkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn in April called out both alt-right and Antifa extremists following scuffles in his city.\n\n\"We absolutely oppose the use of violence in any way. And I think both sides are responsible. I hold as much frustration and blame for Antifa as I do for some of the right-wing groups,\" Arregu\u00edn told Mother Jones at the time.\n\nAntifa is overtly anti-police, does not recognize the authority of the law, and frequently burns American flags.\n\nThe very ideology it was founded on -- communism -- has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 million people around the world, according to \"The Black Book of Communism,\" published by Harvard University Press. Other estimates peg the number of deaths to be much higher.\n\nJust like fascism, communism is a destructive ideology that leads to intolerance, violence, and death.\n\nTo this day, communism continues to oppress more than a billion people around the world. In the world's most populous nation, China, more than 1.3 billion people live day in and day out under communist rule. Religious believers continue to be persecuted and tortured for their beliefs. Horrendous actions that recall Nazi practices, such as the harvesting and selling of organs from live prisoners of conscience, continue to take place to this day.\n\nIn pointing to the violence perpetrated by both sides, Trump stood up against both radical right- and radical left-wing ideologies -- both of which should be condemned and have no place in America, or any place in the world.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3372960", "id": "10087136", "url": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2283191-opinion-why-its-right-to-condemn-violence-from-the-far-right-and-far-left/", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "details": {}, "uri": "711975424", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-05-22", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 77, "amb": false}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-15", "textStart": 965, "freq": 2, "textEnd": 972}], "eventUri": "eng-3372960", "image": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2017/08/18/GettyImages-686795950.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:00:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:00:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "OPINION: Why its Right to Condemn Violence From the Far-Right and Far-Left", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "id": 232}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "id": 277}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "17:00:00", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "title": "The Epoch Times", "id": "119"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

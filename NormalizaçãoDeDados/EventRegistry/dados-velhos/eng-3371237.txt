The IndiGo NEO (VT-ITK) landed safely in Nagpur.\n\nAn IndiGo spokesman said: \"IndiGo flight 6E-135 (Ahmedabad-Kolkata) experienced technical snag in one of the two engines. Though the aircraft could have continued flying safely, the flight crew decided to carry out a precautionary landing at Nagpur to get the aircraft checked. The aircraft landed safely. A ferry flight was organised to complete the journey of stranded passengers at Nagpur. Safety of passengers and crew is of highest priority in IndiGo.\"\n\nSources say 6E-135's pilots got a message that engine number two had failed. The latest problem with the snag-ridden PW engines of A-320 NEO has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\n\nEarlier this month, the DGCA had taken up the issue of constant troubles with PW. IndiGo and GoAir have PW-powered NEOs in their fleets. The unending snags with the engines often keep a significant number of these planes grounded. The meeting was called after seven NEOs of IndiGo and two of GoAir were grounded due to a snag in the engine at the same time. Pratt informed the regulator that it has this particular snag \"to some extent\". Since the snags require replacement of engines, which PW is unable to supply on time, airlines like IndiGo and GoAir suffer prolonged grounding of planes.\n\nDue to the rush for replacement engines for grounded planes, PW is also not able to give engines to Airbus on time for new A-320 NEOs. As a result, the delivery schedule for airlines that ordered the combo of PW-powered A-320 NEOs has gone haywire. Some airlines like Qatar Airways have even cancelled the order for the plane due to delayed deliveries.\n\nWith 430 A-320 Neo family planes on order, IndiGo is Airbus's biggest customer globally for this aircraft. GoAir has ordered 72 A-320 Neos with PW engines and is yet to decide the engine for an additional order of 72 Neos it confirmed last year.\n\nThis March, PW had asked the two LCCs to fly these planes at a lower altitude -- 30,000 feet instead of the higher levels of 36-37,000 feet. While the denser air of lower levels will mean putting less pressure on the engine, flying lower will also lead to an increased fuel consumption for airlines. Less fuel burn was supposed to be the USP of the A-320 Neo, Earlier this year, the DGCA had ordered immediate examination of PW on the A-320 Neos.\n\nP&W's A-320 Neo engines have been plagued with issues like slow engine startup times and erroneous engine software messages in the new engine.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9529260", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Yet another A-320 NEO snag: IndiGo flight to Kolkata lands in Nagpur after getting engine failure message - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60091096/60091096.jpg?87532", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "52726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "54980", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55705", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "label": {"eng": "Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airline"}, "id": "302694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Qatar Airways"}, "id": "305826", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airbus"}, "id": "309312", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "324214", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur", "label": {"eng": "Nagpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "IndiGo"}, "id": "324627", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiGo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)"}, "id": "367423", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_General_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)"}, {"label": {"eng": "GoAir"}, "id": "633273", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoAir"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 330, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 718, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering"}], "time": "17:10:00"}

Subsequently, operators started facing problem with the PW 1100G-JM engine fitted on these aircraft due to wearing of bearing seal plate and combustion chamber distress.\n\n\"Both Indigo and GoAir have confirmed that these issues have impacted the delivery of aircraft. Further, national carrier Air India has also experienced delay in deliveries of some A320 Neo aircraft fitted with CFM Leap 1A26 engines by few days due to non-availability of engines at Airbus facility,\" Jayant Sinha, India's Minister for Civil Aviation said.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbus has assured India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation that it would soon address the combustion chamber distress problem. \"Regrettably, there have been days when we have had to ground as many as nine A320 Neo (planes) due to lack of spare engines. While we do receive certain compensation from Pratt & Whitney for these groundings, the operational disruptions are quite challenging and we are not happy with that situation,\" Aditya Ghosh, IndiGo president, and whole-time director had said during the post-Q1 earnings call on July 31.", "id": "9898908", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "India Grounds Hundreds of Airbus A-320 (NEO) Due to Technical Snag", "image": "https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/105657/91/1056579183.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1979, "date": "2017-07-31", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1986}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "52726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aircraft"}, "id": "302706", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aviation"}, "id": "302715", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}, "id": "304668", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airbus"}, "id": "309312", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Airbus A320 family"}, "id": "309313", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}, "id": "320822", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer"}, {"label": {"eng": "IndiGo"}, "id": "324627", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiGo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pratt & Whitney"}, "id": "348134", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Air India"}, "id": "362401", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)"}, "id": "367423", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_General_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combustion chamber"}, "id": "395207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_chamber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jayant Sinha"}, "id": "462393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayant_Sinha"}, {"label": {"eng": "GoAir"}, "id": "633273", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoAir"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 78, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 328, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 329, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 330, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical"}], "time": "13:06:00"}

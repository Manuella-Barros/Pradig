{"id": 243368574, "title": "Torrential Rains and Possible Flooding Expected as Tropical Wave Approaches Belize", "text": "This weekend, the country will experience torrential rains and possible flooding as a tropical wave approaches the western Caribbean. The National Meteorological Service of Belize expects the weather system to bring rain and thunderstorms across the country. Additionally, the meteorological office is monitoring another system approaching the region, which has a possibility of forming into a hurricane. This morning, Chief Meteorologist Ronald Gordon provided details on the systems and their expected impacts on Belize. Ronald Gordon, Chief Meteorologist: \u201cWe have been monitoring this tropical wave that is approaching the country. It has started affecting us as early as last night. We got some rains in different areas and that wave is currently over the Northwestern Caribbean Sea. We expect that it will move over us, the axis of it will move over us tonight and produce more rainfall. In terms of the exact amounts it can vary, but we are looking at about four to six inches of rainfall at least through to Sunday morning between last night and Sunday morning. Again, we always say the forecast cannot precisely say where this rainfall will occur but based on what the models are showing, we are looking at mostly coastal and northern parts of the country for this rainfall for this period. And I do want to mention that there\u2019s another system that we are monitoring further out in the Atlantic that should be approaching the Lesser Antilles around Monday. We\u2019ll be looking at that system very carefully during the next few days.\u201d A flood forecast has been issued for residents living along the country\u2019s waterways in the south and west. The National Emergency Management Organization\u2019s National Emergency Coordinator Daniel Mendez stressed the importance of the Belizean public being prepared and taking steps to protect themselves. Daniel Mendez, National Emergency Coordinator: \u201cWe highly encourage every family to have a family emergency plan. You need to know what to do. You need to understand where you are and where you need to be. We have been making that accessible. So if you go to our Facebook page or our website, you download the National Shelter List. There\u2019s a QR code on, I think, page three. If you scan that code, it takes you to a blank family plan that you can use if you don\u2019t have one for yourself. For the ministry, for NEMO, we continue our preparations and we continue our plans so we know that we are prepared in case there\u2019s a storm heading our way.\u201d Our newsroom will be following the developments over the weekend.", "summary": "This weekend, the country will experience torrential rains and possible flooding as a tropical wave approaches the western Caribbean.

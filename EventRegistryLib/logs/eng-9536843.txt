Oliver Glasner has confirmed that two key Crystal Palace players are set to return to the matchday squad for Monday's Premier League clash against Manchester United at Selhurst Park.\n\nThe Eagles were unable to extend their three-game winning run in the top flight last weekend as they were forced to settle for a 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage.\n\nNevertheless, Palace sit 14th in the table with 40 points after 35 matches and they are still on course to better their points tally of 45 from last season.\n\nSince his arrival as manager in mid-February, Glanser has had to cope without a number of first-team players due to injury, and star attacker Eberechi Eze was a notable absentee against Fulham because of a knee problem.\n\nMeanwhile, star defender Marc Guehi has been sidelined since February 3 with a knee injury of his own and is yet to feature under new boss Glanser.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nGuehi, Eze available for Man United clash\n\nHowever, Glasner has since delivered a positive update on both players, confirming the Eagles duo are set to return to the matchday squad on Monday.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Glasner said: \"It's very positive news - both of them are fit. Both trained - the players were off after Sunday and we started yesterday preparing them for the Man United game.\n\n\"Both trained yesterday in the full session and again today, so it looks good. If everything continues as we expect, both will be in the squad.\"\n\nWhile Glasner is delighted to have Eze back in contention for Monday, the Austrian is also pleased to welcome back Guehi and has praised the defender's commitment to his recovery, with one eye on representing England at Euro 2024.\n\n\"[Guehi has] worked very hard in rehab,\" said Glasner. \"It took maybe one or two weeks longer than we all hoped, but he has such a great working attitude.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\n\"It's always good when the players are back, and especially when a captain is back, so we're really looking forward to the last three games. Hopefully everything is fine with him and he can play a lot of minutes.\n\n\"I see his working attitude, he's outstanding. He's got a lot of quality but he is also very professional, hard-working, always wanting to improve.\n\n\"He is getting back to the team now with rehab. He is a fantastic player and we will support him as well as we can.\n\n\"We hope he plays some good games for us, and also for England in the Euros.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Guehi, who has been linked with a summer move to Man United, will be fit to start against the Red Devils, so a back three of Nathaniel Clyne, Joachim Andersen and Chris Richards could remain intact to begin with.\n\nFive Palace players who remain sidelined are Sam Johnstone (elbow), Cheick Doucoure (Achilles), Jefferson Lerma, Rob Holding (both thigh) and Matheus Franca (groin) as they all continue to recover from injury.\n\nID:542841:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5544:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Glasner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Glasner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Andersen_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joachim Andersen (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Holding", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Holding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdoulaye_Doucour\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Clyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Clyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Johnstone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Johnstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/09/ebeze.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536843", "eventUri": "eng-9536843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-03", "textStart": 955, "textEnd": 965}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

At the moment, I feel there's that on both sides.\n\n\"I'm not thinking too much about the future, not least because, obviously, this season hasn't been at the level I'd hoped for, either individually or collectively, so far.\n\n\"So, if you want me to be very honest, if I have to think about not continuing in the Premier League, it won't be until after the Euros because nothing will be able to take my focus away from the FA Cup final and the Euros, as there's nothing more important than that at the moment.\"\n\nYet Erik ten Hag has claimed the comments were \"taken out of context\".\n\n\"I know he is Manchester United and I think he is very happy to be here,\" he said.\n\n18:38 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe Manchester United team bus has appeared at Selhurst Park without Bruno Fernandes.\n\nAnthony Martial, Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay also not spotted but Jonny Evans is in south London.\n\n18:30 , Marc Mayo\n\nJefferson Lerma will not be rushed back from his hamstring injury, as Crystal Palace prioritise his desire to be fit for the Copa America.\n\nThe 29-year-old is keen to represent Colombia at this summer's tournament in the United States and has missed Palace's last three matches after feeling tightness in his hamstring after a sprint to chase down Mohamed Salah in the Eagles' surprise 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield on April 14.\n\n\"He's working hard\", manager Oliver Glasner said about Lerma's recovery. \"The Manchester United game is definitely too early. He's working hard to come back for the Wolves game.\n\n\"But, at the same time with muscle injuries, we have one more game against [Aston] Villa. I expect he will be available to play against Villa.\"\n\n18:23 , Marc Mayo\n\nThe talk of Twitter this afternoon has been that Bruno Fernandes will not play for Manchester United tonight.\n\nThat would likely hand Mason Mount a rare start in midfield.\n\nSome breaking news just landing from elsewhere in the Premier League, former Manchester United boss David Moyes will leave West Ham at the end of the season.\n\nWe are two hours away from the action kicking off at Selhurst Park with team news due at 7pm.\n\n17:52 , Marc Mayo\n\nOliver Glasner has admitted it would be hard to keep players who are \"too good for Crystal Palace\" -- adding that there is \"no guarantee\" Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze or Marc Guehi will be at the club next season.\n\nThe Austrian insisted all the club can do is convince the trio that staying at Palace despite interest from elsewhere is the right thing for their careers from a \"sports perspective.\"\n\nManchester United are interested in a move for Olise this summer, while the Red Devils have also previously been linked with England duo Guehi and Eze.\n\nPalace face a fight to hold on to all three ahead of their first full season under Glasner, as rival Premier League clubs could make bids for all three over the course of the summer transfer window.\n\nEze and Olise both signed new long-term deals this season which run until 2027, while Guehi's contract runs to 2026.\n\nHe said of the three players: \"All we can do is show our ambition, show them they are very important players for us, show them from a sports perspective that we are competitive with many teams in the Premier League, that we want to improve, and that they play key parts in our system.\n\n\"But there is also no guarantee. The transfer window, when it opens, is sometimes crazy for several weeks. We are part of it and can't stop it, but we do our job -- showing them the vision, showing them how we want to play, what their role can be. We will see what happens.\"\n\n17:43 , Marc Mayo\n\nPalace won at Old Trafford back in September and they will be eyeing a famous over United.\n\nEvery team gets plenty of chances against Ten Hag's side, who have shown little interest in tightening up despite playing with near enough a non-existent midfield every week.\n\nWith Palace clicking into gear recently and United continuing to produce poor performances, the Eagles are well-capable of piling more pressure on Ten Hag.\n\nPredicted Man Utd XI: Onana; Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Evans, Dalot; Mainoo, McTominay; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund\n\nMarcus Rashford has missed United's last two games with injury and is a major doubt, while Scott McTominay is in a race to be fit after he suffered a knee issue against Burnley. That could mean Mason Mount is handed a rare start.\n\nJonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Anthony Martial are all closing in on a return to first-team action, but it remains to be seen if this match comes too soon.\n\nBruno Fernandes is a doubt after Ten Hag confirmed a knock for his captain in the Burnley draw.\n\nHarry Maguire has also been ruled out after suffering a muscle injury, which leaves him as a doubt for the FA Cup final.\n\n17:19 , Marc Mayo\n\nPredicted Crystal Palace XI: Henderson; Guehi, Andersen, Richards; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Olise, Mateta, Eze\n\nEberechi Eze is expected to return for Palace in a significant boost.\n\nHe was left out against Fulham, but Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that was precautionary after he picked up a knock.\n\nJefferson Lerma is close to being available again after a hamstring injury, and Marc Guehi could also return for the Eagles.\n\n17:04 , Marc Mayo\n\nTV channel: The game will be broadcast on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Ultra HDR. Coverage starts at 6.30pm, ahead of an 8pm kick-off.\n\nLive stream: Subscribers will be able to watch on a live stream via the Sky Go app.\n\nThe Red Devils need a point to return to the top seven in their bid to qualify for Europe, but head to Selhurst Park at the worst time following a resurgence in form for the Eagles.\n\nOliver Glasner's men could well be one of those teams playing on the beach right now yet they have won three of their last four having ended any relegation fears.\n\nKick-off from south London comes at 8pm BST and we'll have our reporter Dom Smith at the ground to provide expert analysis.\n\nSo join us for all the build-up, team news, match action and reaction LIVE!", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors":

I think it gives the West Ham fans the chance to give him the salute he deserves in the next home game. You have to go to 1980 and John Lyle when they won the FA Cup, he was the manager who got them to third in 1986. To win a European trophy is pretty special, and he deserved that for his managerial career in the Premier League.\n\n6:35PM Manchester United underdogs against Crystal Palace\n\nFancy yourselves as a defender and live in the south London area? Get yourself down to Selhurst Park and you might get a game for Manchester United, who find themselves horribly short of numbers at the back.\n\nSay what you will about Harry Maguire, but he at least provide a minimum level of competency as a Premier League defender and is one of United's more spirited players, as well as being an aerial threat in both boxes. Losing Maguire to a muscle injury, with Lisandro Martinez, Raphael Varane and Luke Shaw already on the sidelines, is a major blow. Bruno Fernandes and Scott McTominay are also doubts for Erik ten Hag's team.\n\nIt's quite something when bookmakers have United priced as big as 9/4 for a game against Palace, but that also reflects the feelgood factor around the London club since the appointment of Oliver Glasner. Palace are unbeaten since losing to Manchester City, a run which has featured impressive wins over West Ham, Liverpool and Newcastle. Glasner has made a strong impression, but Palace also have Marc Geuhi, Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze fit again. Just as under Roy Hodgson, they are a different proposition with that trio available. Striker Jean-Philippe Mateta is in sensational form with eight goals in 10 league games.\n\nGuehi has been linked with a summer move away from Selhurst Park, with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool touted as potential destinations. Glasner, though, remains relaxed over any transfer speculation.\n\n\"I am always optimistic because all these players have contracts with Crystal Palace,\" he said.\n\n\"It is May and many situations can change, so nothing is 100 per cent.\n\n\"(Marc) is under contract, he's a good player, he's our captain, so I am very positive and confident that he plays for Crystal Palace (next season).\"\n\nFull team news on the way shortly.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_zeqiri@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Zeqiri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha\u00ebl_Varane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapha\u00ebl Varane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hodgson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hodgson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/05/06/TELEMMGLPICT000376567864_17150169589010_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9T0aesusvN1TE7a0ddd_esI.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536843", "eventUri": "eng-9536843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Red Devils are out of reckoning for the Champions League spot and will not focus on securing a Europa League berth.

Erik Ten Haag has been troubled by injuries to key players throughout their campaign and this has stuttered any growth for them this term.

If a player is too good for Crystal Palace, the possibility that he changes the club is high. The same the other way, if the quality of Crystal Palace is too high for a player.\"\n\nHe said of the three players: \"All we can do is show our ambition, show them they are very important players for us, show them from a sports perspective that we are competitive with many teams in the Premier League, that we want to improve, and that they play key parts in our system.\n\n\"But there is also no guarantee. The transfer window, when it opens, is sometimes crazy for several weeks. We are part of it and can't stop it, but we do our job -- showing them the vision, showing them how we want to play, what their role can be. We will see what happens.\"\n\nThe Austrian revealed he is heavily involved in the club's recruitment process -- headed up by sporting director Dougie Freedman, who has interest from Newcastle.\n\n\"We discuss it [transfer targets] almost every day, thinking about different situations that can happen\", he said.\n\n\"We are talking about what kinds of profiles would help us to be more successful. We discuss it. Of course, we have to be prepared for if something happens or if we think maybe this profile could improve us.\"\n\nGlasner also revealed it was Paddy McCarthy's own decision to stay on as first-team coach within the Austrian's coaching staff, rather than at the request of the board or Glasner himself.\n\n\"It was Paddy's decision. We talked about it, and it was a very, very good decision that he stayed with us.

Manager Oliver Glasner's new philosophy may cause a mass exodus of players - especially those nearing the end of their contracts. With players like Eberechi Eze sought after by top clubs, Palace may not be able to hold onto some of their stars during this transition period.\n\nCrystal Palace are set for a mass exodus in the 2024 summer transfer window. While new boss Oliver Glasner has the Eagles spreading their wings again since taking over from Roy Hodgson in February, it is likely he will take the reins of a transition period in the coming months, which will include shipping off deadwood in favour of his own assets tailored to the philosophy he's trying to embed in SE25.\n\nWith eight players nearing the end of their contracts, Glasner will have big decisions to make regarding several ageing players, while some of his more important assets are being circled by clubs higher up in the Premier League table, thus disturbing the peace and quiet associated with the off-season. What's more, the manager recently admitted it would be hard to keep players who are \"too good for Crystal Palace\", adding that there is \"no guarantee\" Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze or Marc Guehi will be at the club next term.\n\nOn that premise, here are 10 players who could move on to new challenges. They have been sorted by how likely they are to be on their way out during the summer transfer window - with all facing uncertainty over their futures.\n\nPlayers That Could Leave Crystal Palace\n\nCategory\n\nPlayers\n\nChance of Leaving\n\nNathan Ferguson, Nathaniel Clyne, Jeffrey Schlupp, Jairo Riedewald\n\nLikely to Leave\n\nJoel Ward, James Tomkins, Remi Matthews, Eberechi Eze\n\nAlmost Certain to Leave\n\nMarc Guehi, Michael Olise\n\nRelated Who is Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner Oliver Glasner will be the newest Premier League manager as he replaces Roy Hodgson at Crystal Palace. Chance of Leaving Nathan Ferguson, Nathaniel Clyne, Jeffrey Schlupp, Jairo Riedewald\n\nIn the 'chance of leaving' category, all four players are those nearing their contract expiry date but could still offer Palace something with their qualities. In particular, Nathaniel Clyne is a player who has had his career revived under the new management. The Englishman has been a stalwart on the right of Glasner's back-three system, but it's his age of 33 that could prove detrimental to the longevity of that starting spot.\n\nJeffrey Schlupp and Jairo Riedewald follow this same trend. While the former still serves a purpose as a tireless winger from the bench, Riedewald's seven appearances this season suggest the midfielder/defender has been overlooked by his new manager. Nevertheless, there are no rumours linking him elsewhere, and the Dutchman's versatility could see him stay in cases of emergency should his uneconomical \u00a355,000 weekly wage be renegotiated upon expiration.\n\nNathan Ferguson is Palace's forgotten man, with injuries blighting his south London days up until this point. It remains to be seen whether the club are willing to take a risk on the 23-year-old by renewing his contract in spite of ongoing fitness issues - an option which they took the chance on last summer.\n\nLikely to Leave Joel Ward, James Tomkins, Remi Matthews, Eberechi Eze\n\nJoel Ward and James Tomkins are leaders among men for Palace. But at 34 and 35 years old, their contracts expire this summer, which willl probably spell out the end of their time with the Eagles. Meanwhile, Remi Matthews, the club's fourth-choice goalkeeper, is unlikely to be in Glasner's thoughts for the future.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Joel Ward has the most top-flight appearances (303) of any Crystal Palace player in the club's history.\n\nAccording to BBC Sport, Eberechi Eze will be a highly sought-after playmaker in the summer. Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy said the Englishman was \"on a different planet\" in their 5-2 win over West Ham a month back, and added fuel to the fire of his uncertain future by adding:\n\nHe is a Champions League player - I'm sorry, Palace fans. He will not be there next season. This is an unbelievable talent.\n\nHowever, while Palace will entertain offers in the region of \u00a360m, it is two of his teammates who are garnering more interest - which, in turn, could see the Eagles resist losing a trio of superstars, amid growing interest from Manchester City and Tottenham.\n\nRelated \"Killer\" Arsenal Ace Among 3 Men Tipped to Replace Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace Crystal Palace will do well to adequately replace their star man this summer. Almost Certain to Leave Marc Guehi & Michael Olise\n\nPalace's \u00a355m-rated England defender Marc Guehiis of interest to Liverpool (per Football Insider) as they seek a replacement for Cameroonian defender Joel Matip, 32, who is set to leave when his contract runs out in the summer. And with TheSun reporting further interest from Manchester United and Arsenal, it will prove difficult for the south Londoners to keep ahold of the dexterous, two-footed centre-back.\n\nThe Telegraph helped to supplement the fiction surrounding Guehi's impending departure by releasing a list of transfer targets the club has compiled to replace the 23-year-old.\n\nAnother brilliant Palace player almost certain to leave south London in their tracks this summer is Michael Olise. The Manchester United transfer target is willing to head to Old Trafford after his pursuit was approved by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, journalist Ben Jacobs has told GIVEMESPORT. And according to Italian reporter Rudy Galetti, the Frenchman has been identified as the Red Devil's top target after putting plans in place to sell Antony.\n\nRacking up seven goals and four assists in just 1,015 minutes of Premier League football this term, Olise's deadball mastery and explosive demeanour from the right wing will be missed by the Holmesdale faithful - and the club will already have their eye on future replacements. However, to expect to keep both Eze and Olise beyond the 2023/24 campaign is like wanting to build a castle in the sky - it's fantastical.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news",

What we can do is show that Crystal Palace is the right place for every single player.\n\n\"When they see it, when they feel it, and when they believe in it, it gives us the best chance that the players stay. So this is what we can do. This is what the club always did and what we also now want to do, and then we'll see what happens.\n\n\"It's also important that the level Crystal Palace is playing fits to the level the players are playing, you know, in both directions.\n\n\"If, let's say, a player is 'too good' for Crystal Palace, the possibility that he changes the club is high. And the same is the other way. If the quality of Crystal Palace is too high for a player, it's the same that maybe the player changes the club.\n\n\"So that means the higher the level of Crystal Palace gets, the higher the level of the player we'll get that we can keep in our squad.

Not only were Crystal Palace hovering just five points above the Premier League relegation zone but the manager had never previously taken charge of a club mid-season.\n\n\"It was the first time we did it so it was tough,\" the Austrian admits to Sky Sports in an exclusive interview as he looks back on the decision to move to Selhurst Park just over two months ago.\n\n\"In an ideal world, no club would change its manager during the season and no manager would start during the season, but we don't live in an ideal world. You have some challenges and then you have to take decisions.\n\n\"We were thinking a lot about it and said, 'OK, we have to be careful'. It was the challenge to implement parts of the game and how we want to play in tactical, physical and mental behaviour, but not to overload the players. This is still the challenge but we are all together.\"\n\nGlasner need not have worried. After collecting 15 points from their 10 games under their new manager, Palace have long since secured survival - helped in no small part by a statement win at Anfield.\n\n\"You always need both parts - the one who sends the message and the one who receives the message. Both parts did it really well otherwise we couldn't have cleared staying in the Premier League five games before the end of the season, or had some of these great performances.\"\n\nGlasner may admit to caution about taking charge without a pre-season but his appeal to Palace was obvious. After a near 20-year playing career - nearly all of which was spent with Austrian side SV Ried - his first significant managerial success came when he guided LASK Linz into the Austrian Bundesliga in 2017.\n\nA move to Germany followed, which saw Glasner take Wolfsburg into the Champions League, before beating West Ham and Rangers en route to winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022.\n\nAfter previously being linked to teams such as Tottenham and Bayern Munich, Glasner's arrival felt like a coup for Palace - and his methods have quickly translated to the Premier League.\n\nInterestingly, the 49-year-old is unfazed about the challenge presented by coaching in England for the first time, saying: \"There's no big differences. You always have to deal with humans. The language is maybe different but in Frankfurt we had 16 different nationalities.\n\n\"We always look first at the human. Of course, we talk about football, train football and what we want to do, but there's not so much difference.\n\n\"I really enjoy it. I enjoy the Premier League, I enjoy Crystal Palace, Selhurst [Park], the fans, the players and how we work together. London is a very nice city so it's been a good 10 weeks of my life.\"\n\nOnly six teams have won more points than Palace since Glasner's arrival but perhaps even more impressive than the upturn in results has been how quickly the manager has helped the players adapt to his ideas - in particular his switch to a 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAfter more than 15 years as a professional at right-back, Nathaniel Clyne has shifted seamlessly into becoming the right-sided centre-back, while injuries to other squad members mean he's often been joined in defence by midfielder Jefferson Lerma.\n\nHas this mid-season adaptation surprised even the man responsible for it? \"Yes, but it shows the character of the players,\" admits Glasner.\n\n\"We see the profile of a player and if they can fit in the shape and how we want to play, and then we speak to them.\n\n\"I think for Clyne, it was the first time he played as a half-right centre-back and he is 33. You need your character to be open-minded and say, 'yes, the team needs me in this situation and I will give everything I can'.\"\n\nHodgson usually deployed a four-player defence during his second spell in charge but Glasner - who credits Palace's warm-weather training camp in March as being \"very important\" to his strong start in the job - insists the tactical shift is not down to ideology but simply bringing the best out of the players at his disposal.\n\n\"It must fit the players,\" he explains when asked about his preferred system. \"I've played everything. I got promoted in Austria with a 4-4-2, then we switched to a 3-4-3.\n\n\"In Wolfsburg, we reached the Champions League with a 4-2-3-1. In Frankfurt, they played with three at the back before and it fit the squad.\n\n\"Here, we had several injuries and the club signed Daniel Munoz, who is a very offensive right-back, so we said, 'he could fit as a wing-back'.\n\n\"Also, with the offensive players like Jordan Ayew - he was used to playing as a striker so we said, 'should he be a winger or maybe we get him more inside, close to the No 9?'\n\n\"The same with [Eberechi] Eze, [Michael] Olise and [Jeffrey] Schlupp - getting the offensive players in more positions where they can score. We say, 'OK it could fit - let's try it'.\"\n\nIt is in attack where the largest transformation has taken place. Jean-Philippe Mateta managed eight goals in his previous 61 Premier League games - a figure he has matched in the manager's first 10 games.\n\nMateta and Glasner's paths crossed during the striker's time in the Bundesliga with Mainz and the manager was emphatic when asked whether he believed if such an improvement was possible, saying: \"Absolutely.\n\n\"Every player in our squad has their qualities, otherwise they wouldn't be playing for Crystal Palace in the Premier League. We always want to use all the strengths we have in our squad. It's like a puzzle - let's fit it together.\n\n\"JP scored one or two goals and he got this confidence, which you can never train but is so important for strikers. It's up to him to work this hard to get these chances, and then he has this quality.\"\n\nThat Mateta has scored with such regularity despite mostly playing without at least one of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise is even more impressive.\n\nEze and Olise's fitness woes no doubt contributed to Palace's struggles under Hodgson. When the duo finally appeared together last month, they combined for two goals and two assists as West Ham were thrashed 5-2.\n\nIf Palace can keep their star players fit, surely that have an attack to fear? \"If they play like against West Ham, yes, I think so!\" laughs Glasner.\n\n\"They are good individual players with good dribbling, but they can also combine together. They can use their strengths.\n\n\"We have good quality in our squad. This is our job - to encourage them to show it on the pitch.\"\n\nThe fear for Palace fans is they may be running out of time to see how effective Eze and Olise can be under Glasner. Both have been linked with summer moves - including to Manchester United, Palace's opponents on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports - and the manager admits \"nothing is 100 per cent\" regarding their futures.\n\nQuestions remain over a number of their team-mates, seven of whom have contracts that expire at the end of the season. Their top-flight status may be secure but Glasner admits Palace have big decisions looming this summer.\n\n\"It's a discussion we started already,\" he says. \"The end of the season is coming and the sooner these decisions have to be made.\"\n\nBut for now at least, the focus will be on facing Erik ten Hag's side - whose only wins in their last seven matches came against Coventry on penalties and at home to Sheffield United - on Monday.\n\nRegardless of the result, Glasner's short time in south London has raised expectations over what can be achieved next season.\n\nHowever, the manager insists his targets are \"never defined by a position in the league\". Instead, he says: \"I define it by how we play.\n\n\"I'm really pleased with the performances we had. We played with courage, we wanted to show our football - this is what I enjoy.\n\n\"We can also lose. I have to be honest, we could have lost at Liverpool. But we showed we are competitive and this is what we want to do. I know the better we do it, the more points we will get and the more successful we will be.\n\nPalace have already taken six points from games against Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Newcastle under Glasner and United will hold no fear for a manager that beat Barcelona in the Nou Camp last season. In fact, Glasner is relishing competing against such illustrious opponents.\n\n\"It's maybe one of the best things in the Premier League - you play the best teams in the world,\" he says. \"It's a great atmosphere in every single stadium and there's a lot of intensity on the pitch and in the stadiums.\n\n\"I appreciate being a manager in the Premier League.\" That mid-season move has paid off.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Their team is not even remotely close to being considered good enough considering the size of the club. I'd be more shocked if Manchester United won this game - that's where it's got to at the moment.\n\n\"There have been reports that Marcus Rashford could be offloaded this summer.

So, how can I possibly back them to beat Palace?\n\n\"The one thing that might help Erik ten Hag's side is that Eagles forward Eberechi Eze is doubtful with a knee injury, but Jean-Philippe Mateta is still on fire and will be a real handful for the United defence.\n\n\"Palace won 1-0 at Old Trafford in September but I don't want to upset United fans again by predicting they will suffer another defeat.\n\n\"I do want to tip Palace to win, but there are so many angry United fans out there who think I am against their club, I am going to say United will get a lucky draw to try to get them onside.\"\n\nPrediction: Palace 1-1 United\n\nMark Lawrenson - Paddy Power\n\nSpeaking to Paddy Power, he said: \"There's strange messages coming out of Manchester United at the moment about what they will or will not do in the summer.\n\n\"I think everyone's just guessing. Crystal Palace have been good under their new manager Oliver Glasner but I think the results are helped by the fact the two boys Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise are back.

Lacroix has excelled under Glasner, making him a prime target. With only a year left on his contract, Palace may pursue him for financial value. Following talks between Lacroix and Glasner, a potential move to Palace is on the cards. His skill set is believed to suit the Premier League well.\n\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has got the club firing in recent weeks after his appointment back in February - and with the Austrian looking forward to recruitments ahead of the summer transfer window, Dean Jones has exclusively told GIVEMESPORT that a deal to bring Wolfsburg star Maxence Lacroix could be in the offing to boost their defensive ranks.\n\nGlasner took over the Eagles after a run of just two wins in three-and-a-half-weeks, leaving Palace in 15th place in the league and almost staring relegation down the barrel. But a win in his first game followed up by three successive wins throughout April, has revived the south London outfit, with Palace currently sitting closer to the European places than they are to the bottom three.\n\nWith Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Marc Guehi all being linked with moves away in the summer, it promises to be a transfer window that could see a lot of stars coming in and out of the club - and Jones has claimed that Palace are interested in the young Frenchman, with Glasner knowing him well from his time in the Bundesliga having brought him to Wolfsburg, alongside having a year left on his contract.\n\nCrystal Palace: Maxence Lacroix Transfer Latest Palace could be in the market for a defender with Marc Guehi linked away\n\nReports have linked Lacroix with a move to Palace after he achieved the best form of his career under Glasner. Joining from French outfit Sochaux in 2020, Lacroix has already made over 100 appearances for the club and in the 2020/21 season, he helped them finish fourth in the Bundesliga, qualifying for the Champions League in the process - but some nightmarish campaigns since have only seen the club finish as high as eighth since. That has seen Lacroix look for a potential move away, with Palace being touted as a potential destination, and with only a year left on his contract, Lacroix could be a financially attainable target.\n\nAnd to add fuel to the fire, the defender has also opened up on chats that he had with Glasner following Palace's 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield in April. He told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung:\n\n\"We spoke on the phone after the game between Liverpool FC and Crystal Palace about two weeks ago. It's not the time to talk about my future. All that matters to me now is Wolfsburg. We have a mission, which is to stay in the league. And when this mission is accomplished, we can head on holiday with a smile. We can talk after the season.\"\n\nJones: \"Definite Potential to Bring Lacroix to Crystal Palace\" Lacroix was previously linked with Chelsea after he burst onto the scene\n\nSpeaking exclusively to GIVEMESPORT, Jones claimed that there is a serious chance for the 24-year-old - who could cost \u00a317m according to reports from Bild - to move to Selhurst Park - especially with Guehi potentially departing the club with others circling. He said:\n\n\"There is definite potential here for a deal because his situation in Germany makes him a good player to be targeting. Oliver Glasner already knows him well and is a fan of bringing him over.\n\n\"There is belief that he has the traits to do well in the Premier League. It's a good time to be targeting him because he only has a year left on his contract and at a time when they might well need a Marc Guehi replacement, he'd not be a bad option to bring in early in the summer.\"\n\nLacroix Could Be a Strong Marc Guehi Replacement Guehi has been excellent for Palace in recent years\n\nMarc Guehi's development at Palace has seen him make the England squad, and the defender boasts a huge chance of making Gareth Southgate's EURO 2024 squad for this summer's tournament in Germany.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Guehi only featured in 2 games for Chelsea - both in the EFL Cup in 2019 - before departing for south London.\n\nThe Chelsea academy graduate has made over 100 appearances for the Eagles and nine caps for England, though he has been linked with clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal, which would increase his standing and profile in the game. Lacroix would offer a superb replacement for the Three Lions star, though with Guehi and Joachim Andersen currently a first-choice pairing, Palace may not be able to offer Lacroix first-team football unless one was to depart.\n\nRelated Exclusive: Crystal Palace 'Scouting' \u00a330m Gabriel Sara Crystal Palace have been running the rule over Gabriel Sara after there has been uncertainty over whether he will remain on Norwich City's books\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

With only four matches to go and very little chance of climbing high enough to catch Spurs in fifth, United are left to just fend off those around them knowing a valuable spot in the Europa League could be at stake.\n\nIt feels very much like Erik ten Hag's time with United is coming to an end soon, as they sputter towards the end of the season with a flurry of mistake-filled performances.\n\nIn contrast, they visit a Palace side which is in exceptional form, on four matches unbeaten under the new management of Oliver Glasner who took over after the departure of Roy Hodgson in mid-February and is finally finding his footing at the club. He has the club's young core firing up front with an attacking flair missing under Hodgson's watch.\n\nUSA: Click here to see the latest odds for Man United vs Crystal Palace and bet Premier League matches\n\nThanks to their recent form, which includes recent wins over Newcastle, West Ham, and Liverpool, Crystal Palace are favourites at home over the Red Devils, something you don't see too often. Palace are safe from relegation and have little to play for down the stretch, but that hasn't mattered as youngsters Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise continue to dazzle with the former pushing for a spot in England's Euro 2024 squad.\n\nThis Monday night match has the potential to get weird, and we're backing a stalemate in what could devolve into a chaotic and frenetic match, something which Manchester United fans have unfortunately become used to under Erik ten Hag of late.\n\nUnder Roy Hodgson this season, Crystal Palace were 16th in the Premier League in total shots upon his resignation, but since Oliver Glasner took over the Eagles have been far more attack-minded and to great effect. While they don't rip off a ton of shots in total, they've been one of the most efficient teams in the Premier League -- over their last seven games, Palace sit fourth in the Premier League with 40 percent of their efforts on target.\n\nThat presents a fascinating and enjoyable matchup against a Man United side that concedes a ton of shots (133 in their last six games, most in the Premier League by a mile) but just 29 percent of those on target, third-lowest in the league.\n\nThe 32-shot threshold feels like a very high bar to clear, but these two clubs produced a combined 27 efforts in the reverse fixture back in September in a 1-0 final scoreline featuring a defensive-minded Crystal Palace. With this new-look Eagles side sure to contribute more than the eight attempts (two on target) they produced in the last meeting, you can safely back both these totals in a match that has a real chance to become a track meet.\n\nWhile the over 3.5 total goal mark at +120 feels enticing, Manchester United don't have enough in-form players to trust with their part of that combined tally. Rasmus Hojlund has not had enough volume up front to make him a consistent threat, and Marcus Rashford is mired in a brutal slump through the second half of the season.\n\nPalace, though, at home, are in the opposite situation. There are so many in-form players for the Eagles that picking an individual goal scorer almost feels foolhardy.

But also, yeah, like every team, they have their weaknesses.\n\n\"It's for us to control their strengths, but also use their weaknesses, and also what fits to our strengths. We can't play, or we don't want to play, in a different way to what we did in the past.\n\n\"We get confidence in what we are doing. We see, yes, we've kept the last three teams at Fulham, Newcastle and West Ham in single figures of shots against us - it was four, seven and nine.\n\n\"And this is how we want to play, to keep them away, get a lot of pressure on the ball and create chances to score. This is the way we want to play. This is the same way against Man United.\n\n\"Of course, we prepare, but we have to take care of where we get our chances. And then go there, play with the support of our fans - and they will be, again, a fantastic support.

-- Hughes, Wharton -- Olise, Eze, Schlupp -- Mateta.\n\nCrystal Palace subs (9): TBC\n\nMan United's chances of edging out Newcastle in the race for a top-six place remain in the balance with Ten Hag's team winning just one of their last six Premier League matches.\n\nTheir away form has yielded no wins in their last three league games away from Old Trafford and Palace are in unbeaten in four,

The Red Devils have avoided defeat in their last four league games and are looking to make it five away at Palace. However, United have drawn three of those four games, which has caused them to crash out of the Premier League top-four race.\n\nOliver Glasner's side, who are also unbeaten in their last four Premier League outings, are in much better shape, having beaten Liverpool, West Ham United, and Newcastle United and drawn with Fulham.\n\nPaul Merson Says He Will Be Shocked If Manchester United Did Not Lose To Crystal Palace\n\nHistorically, it has been a one-sided contest, but Merson does not think old records will come to the Red Devils' rescue this Monday. Previewing Manchester United's clash with Crystal Palace, Merson bluntly wrote (via Sportskeeda):\n\n\"If Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise are fully fit, Crystal Palace will beat Manchester United and anyone who has watched the Red Devils in recent weeks will agree with me.\n\n\"Manchester United are a massive football club, but not a massive football team anymore. Their team is not even remotely close to being considered good enough considering the size of the club. I'd be more shocked if Manchester United won this game - that's where it's got to at the moment.\"\n\nHe concluded by adding:\n\n\"There have been reports that Marcus Rashford could be offloaded this summer. I like him but blows hot and cold far too often for teams to pay silly money for him, so I cant see him getting a transfer.\"\n\nMerson's prediction: 2-1 for Crystal Palace\n\nIn their previous meeting at Old Trafford earlier this season, Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. Joachim Andersen scored the only goal of the game in the 25th minute.\n\nThroughout history, the two teams have met 59 times in the Premier League (via Sportsmole).

However, after a 1-1 draw with Burnley last time out, confidence can't be too high.\n\nCrystal Palace are not the easiest opponents for Man Utd as they aim to get back on track, with Oliver Glasner having overseen some significant improvements since taking over from Roy Hodgson. The Eagles are unbeaten in their last four matches, including victories over Liverpool, West Ham United and Newcastle.\n\nThese two sides have already clashed twice this season, both coming at Old Trafford. The first saw Man Utd win 3-0 in the Carabao Cup in late September, but the London side got their revenge four days later with a 1-0 Premier League victory.\n\nHere is 90min's guide to Crystal Palace vs Man Utd.\n\nCrystal Palace have been handed a double injury boost prior to Man Utd's visit, with Glasner confirming that both Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze should be fit and available for Monday's clash. The former has been missing since early February, while the latter sat out the 1-1 draw with Fulham last time out.\n\nHowever, the Eagles are still without a host of players, including long-term absentee Cheick Doucoure. Sam Johnstone, Rob Holding and Matheus Franca should all miss out at Selhurst Park, while Jefferson Lerma is a significant injury doubt.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted lineup (5-2-3): Henderson; Munoz, Clyne, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell; Wharton, Hughes; Olise, Mateta, Eze.\n\nMan Utd's rotten luck with injuries hasn't eased up as we head into the final few matches of the season, with the Red Devils missing plenty of influential stars.\n\nThe defence has been most impacted by fitness issues, with Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Willy Kambwala all sidelined at present. Jonny Evans is also a doubt for the trip to London, but could yet be available for Ten Hag after returning to training.\n\nMarcus Rashford is a significant absentee in the forward line, with Anthony Martial still rebuilding his fitness after returning to training last week. Scott McTominay could be involved despite missing training, while captain Bruno Fernandes may be able to play through an unspecified fitness problem at Selhurst Park according to Ten Hag.\n\nMan Utd predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): Onana; Dalot, Evans, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka; Casemiro, Mainoo; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund.\n\nCrystal Palace have been in excellent form of late and even have a scalp at Anfield to their name, with Glasner having transformed the Eagles since his arrival. In their current mood, a visit from a misfiring Man Utd side ravaged by injuries won't concern them all too much.\n\nTen Hag's fitness woes mean that Man Utd are up against it at Selhurst Park and the most recent home draw with relegation-threatened Burnley will have chipped away at their confidence even further.

Wins for Newcastle and Chelsea saw them leapfrog United, pushing Ten Hag's side down to eighth position.\n\nOn Thursday, Ten Hag confirmed that Bruno Fernandes is doubtful for the game and that a late decision would be made on Scott McTominay.\n\nThe news of Jonny Evans' return ahead of tonight's game was even more of a boost when it was revealed on Sunday night that Harry Maguire had picked up a knock and will be out for three weeks.

Guehi has recovered from the knee operation he underwent in February, while Eze has overcome a knee problem of his own.\n\nRegarding Manchester United, Bruno Fernandes, who was photographed wearing wrist protection on Friday, is a slight doubt. However, Ten Hag hinted during his press conference that he expects his captain to be available.\n\nAnthony Martial has not yet fully resumed training with his teammates, so he will once again be unavailable.

Erik ten Hag's men are eighth but three points could move them into sixth and within three points of Tottenham Hotspur in fifth with three games to go. Easier said than done, though, with Oliver Glasner's side in good form, although a jump into the top half of the EPL table is probably beyond them now. Palace have four wins, three draws and three losses under their new boss with an unbeaten run of four coming into this one with 10 points from a possible 12 after wins over Liverpool, West Ham United and Newcastle United before a draw with Fulham.\n\nThe Eagles have not finished higher than 10th since their Championship promotion back in 2013 and a win here would complete a Premier League double over United, having won 1-0 at Old Trafford while it could be a third straight home win. United are out of UEFA Champions League contention although Europa League and Europa Conference League berths are still possible. Spurs' faltering form is probably encouragement enough that fifth place could be doable but there is also the FA Cup which could still salvage some pride after a rough season. The Red Devils are unbeaten since early April but have won just one of their last four with Ten Hag's men winning just seven times on the road.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Guehi is unlikely to start but Eze could come in alongside Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta up top while January arrival Adam Wharton should continue.\n\nPotential Palace XI: Henderson; Clyne, Andersen, Richards; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Olise, Mateta, Eze.\n\nUnited: Bruno Fernandes is a doubt, although Ten Hag suggested he could be fit while Scott McTominay should also return with Christian Eriksen possibly dropping out. Jonny Evans could partner Casemiro in defense with Harry Maguire ruled out for the next three weeks while Anthony Martial is not yet back in full training. Antony scored vs. Burnley and should see off Amad Diallo's challenge for a starting role. Marcus Rashford, Willy Kambwala, Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are all out.\n\nPotential United XI: Onana; Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Evans, Dalot; McTominay, Mainoo; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis one will be tight and could easily finish in a draw but expect United to just about shade the game and take the points to keep the pressure on Spurs.

vs. Man Utd - prediction, team news, lineups", "body": "Sports Mole previews Monday's Premier League clash between Crystal Palace and Manchester United, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nManchester United will be bidding to return to sixth position in the Premier League table when they head to Selhurst Park on Monday evening to tackle an in-form Crystal Palace outfit.\n\nThe Red Devils are currently seventh in the division, two points behind sixth-placed Newcastle United, while Palace occupy 14th, four points behind 13th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nOliver Glasner has certainly made a positive impression since arriving as Palace head coach in the middle of February, with the 49-year-old, who replaced Roy Hodgson at the helm, boasting a record of four wins, three draws and three losses from his 10 games in charge.\n\nThe Eagles will bring a four-game unbeaten run into this match, picking up 10 points from the last 12 available, having overcome Liverpool, West Ham United and Newcastle United before drawing 1-1 with Fulham last time out.\n\nPalace boast a record of 10 wins, 10 draws and 15 defeats from their 35 Premier League matches this season to collect 40 points, which has left them eight points behind 10th-placed Bournemouth, but they are only four from both Fulham and Brighton in 12th and 13th respectively.\n\nThe Eagles have not finished higher than 10th since being promoted from the Championship back in 2013, but they were 11th last term, so there has been a drop-off this season.\n\nPalace will be looking to complete a league double over Man United for the first time in their history on Monday evening, having recorded a 1-0 victory when the pair met at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.\n\nThe capital side will also be aiming to make it three straight Premier League wins at Selhurst Park for the first time since October 2022.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nMan United can no longer claim a Champions League spot for next season, with the Red Devils instead battling to qualify for either the Europa League or Conference League in 2024-25.\n\nErik ten Hag's side, as mentioned, dropped to seventh on Saturday after Newcastle beat Burnley, but a win on Monday evening would see them return to sixth spot, potentially only three points behind fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur depending on the capital side's result against Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nThere is no getting away from the fact that it has been a hugely difficult campaign for Man United, who have already suffered 12 league defeats, but the club can secure more domestic silverware this term, preparing to take on Manchester City in the final of the FA Cup at the end of the month.\n\nThe Red Devils are unbeaten since their late 4-3 loss at Chelsea on April 4, but they have only won one of their four league games since then and were held to a 1-1 draw by struggling Burnley at Old Trafford last weekend.\n\nMan United have won seven, drawn three and lost seven of their 17 away league games this season, and they will be facing a Palace outfit that have also lost seven times at home in the Premier League in 2023-24.\n\nThe 20-time English champions won eight of their opening 11 away Premier League fixtures with Palace but are now winless in their last three, including a 1-1 draw during the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nCrystal Palace Premier League form: L L W W W D\n\nManchester United Premier League form: D L D D W D\n\nManchester United form (all competitions): L D D W W D\n\nTeam News\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nPalace will again be without the services of Sam Johnstone, Cheick Doucoure, Jefferson Lerma, Rob Holding and Matheus Franca for the clash with Man United through injury.\n\nEberechi Eze and Marc Guehi are both set to return to the squad, though, with the latter recovering from the knee operation that he underwent in February, while the former has overcome a knee problem of his own.\n\nWhile Guehi is unlikely to start, Eze is set to feature in the front three alongside Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has scored 11 Premier League goals during a strong campaign.\n\nA 3-4-3 formation should also include Adam Wharton, who has made a strong impression since his arrival from Blackburn Rovers during the January transfer window.\n\nAs for Man United, Bruno Fernandes, who was pictured wearing protection on his wrist on Friday, is a minor doubt, but Ten Hag hinted during his press conference that he is expecting his captain to be available.\n\nScott McTominay is also set to overcome a knee injury to return to the side, with Christian Eriksen likely to be the player to make way if the Scot does prove his fitness.\n\nJonny Evans returned to training on Thursday and could be back in the squad, but Anthony Martial is not yet in full training alongside his teammates, so he will again miss out.\n\nMarcus Rashford is also still absent for the 20-time English champions alongside Willy Kambwala, Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia.\n\nAntony scored in the 1-1 draw with Burnley last time out and should keep his spot down the right on Monday evening despite pressure from Amad Diallo.\n\nCrystal Palace possible starting lineup:\n\nHenderson; Clyne, Andersen, Richards; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Olise, Mateta, Eze\n\nManchester United possible starting lineup:\n\nOnana; Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Maguire, Dalot; McTominay, Mainoo; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund\n\nWe say: Crystal Palace 1-1 Manchester United\n\nMan United will once again have a patched-up back four for this match, and it is so difficult to back them to keep a clean sheet at the moment, especially against an in-form Palace. The Red Devils still have a lot of talent down the other end, though, and we fancy the points to be shared in the capital on Monday night.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines

United had goals disallowed either side of the break, but were largely seconf-best to Oliver Glasner's men.\n\nTyrick Mitchell added a third an hour in, turning home after Joachim Andersen fed the ball into his path. Olise scored the pick of the goals to make it 4-0, though, blasting home after Casemiro gifted the ball to Daniel Munoz in the build-up, and only a post kept Odsonne Edouard from adding a late fifth.\n\nThe defeat leaves Ten Hag's team down in eight, with their hopes of any European football next term hanging by a thread. For Palace, though, victory meant 13 points from a possible 15 as their impressive form under Glasner continued.\n\nOlise opened the scoring inside 15 minutes, slicing through the United backline with ease before finding the bottom corner of Andre Onana's net. The visitors thought they were level when Casemiro's looping header landed in Dean Henderson's net, only for the goal to be ruled out for a foul on Henderson by Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nIt was two before half-time, with Palace winning a turnover near the halfway line and Mateta bursting past Jonny Evans before finding the net. United thought they had one back moments after the restart, but Casemiro had strayed well offside before tucking home the rebound after his first effort hit the post.\n\nPalace looked relatively comfortable at 2-0, but made sure through Mitchell and then Olise's second. Here are Mirror Football's talking points from a dream evening for Palace and a nightmare for their opponents.\n\n1. Mateta's run continues\n\nWho stood out for you at Selhurst Park? Let us know in the comments section\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta took advantage of weak defending to score Palace's second goal\n\nMateta's goal means he's now scored in six straight home games for Crystal Palace. He's scored nine since Oliver Glasner was appointed in February, having netted just three times in the league before then.\n\nThe Frenchman enjoyed a streaky spell in front of goal before joining Palace, starting the 2020-21 season with 10 in nine appearances for Mainz before moving to Selhurst Park. He managed just two goals in the whole of last season, though, making his recent run all the more remarkable.\n\nPalace's best Premier League goal return as a team is the 51 they delivered in 2018-19. Monday's victory took them up to 49, with two games still to go as they look to pass that mark.\n\n2. Bruno's absence felt with Mount toothless Mason Mount struggled to gain a foothold in the game\n\nIf you were thinking 'Bruno Fernandes doesn't tend to miss many games', you'd be right. This was the first ever Manchester United game the captain has sat out through injury, and, according to some reports, the first in his entire career.\n\nIn the absence of the Portuguese, United's midfield three of Christian Eriksen, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount struggled to gain a foothold in the game. Indeed, Eriksen and Mainoo in particular were left exposed as Olise faced little resistance on his route through for the opener.\n\nMount might be the one United would have expected to step up, given his transfer fee. He was mostly anonymous, though, and will have to hope a proper pre-season can reinvigorate him after an injury-hit first season at his new club,\n\n3. France can't afford to lose Olise Michael Olise ran the show for Palace\n\nMichael Olise might have made his way through France's youth set-up, but he's yet to earn a senior cap for Les Bleus. On the strength of his football under Oliver Glasner, they may want to change that sooner rather than later.\n\nOlise is also eligible to represent England, Nigeria or Algeria. Once he's cap-tied, though, those options will disappear for the Palace star.\n\nWhile injuries have been a concern, Olise's form and raw talent puts him on a trajectory which would make him a match for most when he hits his peak. For context, he's younger than England pair Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka, while France's wide options Ousmane Dembele and Kingsley Coman have a good few years on him.\n\n4. Evans and Casemiro left horribly exposed United's makeshift defence was left exposed\n\nThere have been times this season when Jonny Evans has looked like a man reborn. For Palace's second goal, though, we were very much watching a veteran brought back to do whatever job he could at the tail end of his career.\n\nUnited's horrible luck with injuries is hardly something they could have predicted, but there are still ways to manage these things. The combination of lack of pace in the middle and lack of pace at the back was enough of a risk even before allowing one such player to be left one-on-one.\n\nIt wasn't much better for Casemiro, though at least he had the excuse of being forced to play in a less familiar position. That won't make things easier for the travelling fans to take, though, and based on this showing, Arsenal shouldn't feel as though they have much to fear ahead of Sunday's game.\n\n5. Europe worries raise questions about Ten Hag's future Erik ten Hag will want an instant response from his team\n\nMight Manchester United benefit from a season without European football? Regardless of your feelings, there's every chance that's what they'll get.\n\nUnited's defeat leaves them down in eighth, with Chelsea opening up a huge goal difference gulf with their 5-0 victory over West Ham on Sunday. If Ten Hag's team lose their next two against Arsenal and Newcastle, that might be as high as they can finish despite a more welcoming fixture against Brighton on the final day.\n\nThat would leave an FA Cup final victory as their last remaining chance of Europe. And, based on how unconvincingly they scraped through the last two rounds, that's not something you'd back them to do.\n\nWhat might this mean for Erik ten Hag, then? His future has been up for debate for a while, and could it be that summer talks with Sir Jim Ratcliffe end with the part-owner deciding someone else is better placed to lead the club forward?\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Erik ten Hag has more injuries to contend with as well, with Harry Maguire ruled out and Scott McTominay and Bruno Fernandes battling to prove their fitness to feature against the in-form Eagles, who have three of their previous games and have been impressive under new manager Oliver Glasner.\n\nFernandes' record at stake\n\nBruno Fernandes is yet to miss a United game through injury after more than four years at the club but he is a doubt for the game at Selhurst Park and faces a race against time to maintain that perfect record.\n\nALSO READ: United team news for Crystal Palace fixture\n\nALSO READ: Everything Ten Hag said in his press conference\n\nThe 29-year-old suffered a broken hand at Wembley two weeks ago and has played through the pain barrier against Sheffield United and Burnley, but he had a problem after that draw with the Clarets that has left him doubtful.\n\nFernandes' absence would probably give Mason Mount the chance to start in his preferred attacking midfield role, but United would be weaker without their in-form captain and at a time when they need the points that would be bad news.\n\nOlise scouting mission\n\nThis Palace squad is full of entertaining attacking outlets and right-winger Michael Olise, the subject of interest from Chelsea last summer, is attracting coveted glances once again. United are one of the teams reported to be in for the 22-year-old and they will get to see up-close just how good he is tonight.\n\nHis record of seven goals and four assists in 16 Premier League games this season is impressive. With Antony set to start on the right for United the comparison between the effectiveness of the two wingers will be something to keep an eye on.\n\nPoints and goals needed\n\nA run of just two wins in nine Premier League games means there is now a real danger that United could end up out of Europe entirely, never mind having to settle for the Europa Conference League.\n\nWinning the FA Cup could still make the league finish irrelevant when it comes to Europe, but that is a pressure you don't want in a game in which you are underdogs for. A strong finish in the final four games is badly needed.\n\nThis United side still has work to do to avoid the records set in 2021/22 as well, when a record of 57 goals scored resulted in a goal difference of zero and a return of 58 points was the lowest in the Premier League era. They are five goals and four points short of those tallies at the moment.\n\nPalace playing well\n\nThis game will be a test for United as well. Under Glasner Palace have improved drastically and they are now unbeaten in four games, with three of them wins. Their last two at Selhurst Park have ended in a 5-2 win against West Ham and a 2-0 success against Newcastle.\n\nWith Eze and Olise pulling the strings, Jean-Philippe Mateta scoring goals and Adam Wharton looking like an excellent buy in midfield they pose a real threat. United will need to be at their best to get a result.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyrone_marshall@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Tyrone Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Mount", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mason Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Wharton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Wharton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29104188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150037318.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536843", "eventUri": "eng-9536843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Former chief executive Richard Arnold had said the forward had no future at Old Trafford after he was charged with attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. While police subsequently dropped those charges, United conducted an internal investigation and there was a backlash when the club planned to bring him back.\n\nMan Utd make decision on Mason Greenwood future as club plan summer clearout\n\n17:37 , Mike Jones\n\n\"He is our captain and he works during the off season, so hard on the training ground, and he brings the energy in every game,\" Erik ten Hag said. \"Every occasion, he sets an example as a captain for the team and you see his form growing across the season.\n\n\"By the end of the season, he is in great form and he is scoring goals, making key actions with assists.\n\n\"I am really impressed with his performances, contributing to the team spirit but also individually with his creation.

Lewis-Potter starred in his final season at Hull City scoring 13 goals. Souttar was one of Australia's best players in the Qatar World Cup before a \u00a315m move from Stoke to Leicester, while Brighton broke their record transfer fee to sign Pedro.\n\nThey have only had fleeting moments in their Premier League beginnings, something that can't be said about Crystal Palace's most recent Championship addition Adam Wharton, who has not just settled well since switching Blackburn for south London but has appeared as one of Oliver Glasner's best performers in recent weeks.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star making a late push for England's Euro 2024 squad\n\n17:07 , Mike Jones\n\nCrystal Palace have been in fine form in recent weeks and will be difficult opponents especially with home advantage.\n\nManchester United may be without Bruno Fernandes which will hurt their chances of winning but a necessity to collect three points and qualify for Europe could drive them to new heights of success.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe's clearout of the senior off-field figures at Manchester United has continued with the announcement that interim CEO Patrick Stewart and Chief Financial Officer Cliff Baty will leave at the end of the season.\n\nStewart, who is also the club's Chief Legal Officer, and Baty are going by mutual consent as they follow Football Director John Murtough in departing, while former Chief Executive Richard Arnold stepped down before the Ineos billionaire's investment at Old Trafford was completed.\n\nUnited will have four chief executives in nine months with former Juventus CEO Jean Claude Blanc, a director of the club and an ally of Ratcliffe, taking the role on a temporary basis before Omar Berrada completes his gardening leave and can start on 13 July.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe continues Man United clearout as more senior figures depart\n\n16:52 , Mike Jones\n\nCrystal Palace vs Manchester United is due to kick off at 8pm BST on Monday 6 May at Selhurst Park.\n\nViewers in the United Kingdom can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League, with coverage on the latter channel from 6.30pm. Subscribers can stream the action via Sky Go.\n\nUnited will listen to offers for virtually all of Ten Hag's squad, except Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo, though it would take a huge bid for them to sell Marcus Rashford, but the Dutchman does not expect vast numbers of players to leave.\n\nThey have confirmed that Anthony Martial will go when his contract expires and Raphael Varane could follow suit, while United are not expected to take up their option to buy Sofyan Amrabat but Ten Hag hit out at suggestions everyone else will move on.\n\n'It's a joke': Erik ten Hag lashes out at Manchester United suggestion\n\nSancho, who cost United \u00a373m, has not played for them since August and was training with the youth team before he was loaned to Dortmund in January.\n\nThe England international fell out with Ten Hag, who claimed Sancho had not trained well when he explained his omission from the squad for September's defeat to Arsenal. It prompted the 24-year-old to produce a social-media post that inferred the manager had lied, with Ten Hag then wanting an apology before he would pick Sancho again and none forthcoming.\n\nWhile Sancho's loan at Dortmund could make United up to \u20ac7.5m, one of the most expensive signings in their history has played 77 minutes of football for them this season and United could face writing off much of their high investment.\n\nJadon Sancho still holds 'high value' for Man Utd, claims Erik ten Hag\n\nFernandes had said in an interview in his native Portugal that he would consider his future after Euro 2024 while United's financial issues mean they would listen to offers for most of their squad.\n\nBut Ten Hag is keen to keep the 29-year-old, who is United's 15-goal top scorer this season, as he said the midfielder's comments were misinterpreted.\n\n\"I know he is very happy to be here,\" he stated, adding that \"absolutely\" he wanted Fernandes to stay. He has a contract until 2026, with the club possessing an option to extend it for a further season.\n\nFernandes 'happy' at Man Utd as Ten Hag responds to transfer talks\n\n16:00 , Jack Rathborn\n\nCrystal Palace XI: Henderson; Clyne, Anderson, Guehi; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Olise, Mateta, Eze.\n\nManchester United XI: Onana; Wan-Bissaka, Evans, Maguire, Dalot; Mainoo, Casemiro; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund.\n\n15:15 , Jack Rathborn\n\nCrystal Palace have been boosted by the return to fitness of Marc Guehi, in line to feature for the first time since February due to a knee injury. Eberechi Eze should also be back available.\n\nBruno Fernandes is a doubt for Manchester United, with fellow midfielder Scott McTominay similarly set to be assessed. Marcus Rashford remains absent though Jonny Evans and Anthony Martial are back in training.\n\nWins for Newcastle and Chelsea have seen the Red Devils drop to eighth in the table where they are now outside of the automatic spots for next season's European campaigns. Victory this evening would send them back up to sixth and keep them in control of their own destiny.\n\nWith matches against Arsenal and Newcastle on the horizon next week, United cannot afford to drop any points tonight and the manner in which they finish off this season could play a crucial part in whether Ten Hag keeps his job in the summer.\n\nElsewhere, a run of three wins and a draw have lifted Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace out of any relegation trouble with the club now looking to push on and finish as high as possible in the league.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com",

The draw meant that United have only won one of their last seven 90-minute matches - and that was the 4-2 victory against bottom-of-the-league Sheffield United.\n\nNext up for United is a trip to Palace, with the Eagles finding their feet under Oliver Glasner in recent weeks. The last meeting between the two saw United fall to a 1-0 loss at Old Trafford, and while Palace will be looking to do the double over United, three points will be vital for Ten Hag's side as they look to secure a top six finish.\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag has hinted at biggest Manchester United change coming this summer\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag speaks out on Manchester United sack rumours\n\nSo, how could United fare against the Eagles? Let's take a look.\n\nPlease note, this simulation was completed before the news Harry Maguire will be out for three weeks through injury.\n\nWe simulated Crystal Palace vs Manchester United to get a score prediction\n\nTo complete this simulation, we used EA FC 24 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions. We predict that the hosts could line up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Henderson; Clyne, Andersen, Richards; Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Olise, Eze; Mateta.\n\nWe predict that United could set up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their line-up as follows: Onana; Dalot, Casemiro, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka; Mainoo, Mount, Fernandes; Amad, Hojlund, Garnacho.\n\nPalace entered the clash in good form, and they showed that in the first five minutes when Jean-Philippe Mateta continued his goalscoring streak with a powerful header from close range. It was a poor start for United, but the response was positive as they instantly went on the front foot.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho and Amad were bright sparks on either wing for United, but Rasmus Hojlund wasn't much help as the striker sent three of their crosses wide of the target in the first half. United were the better side after the restart with Garnacho continuing to cause problems for the Palace back line, and in the 56th minute the Argentine finally got on the scoresheet.\n\nAs Olise looked to take on Bruno Fernandes in midfield, the United man made a brilliant tackle to win back possession and set Garnacho free down the left. The winger skipped by Nathaniel Clyne before racing into the box, and from a tight angle he wrapped his foot around the ball to curl his effort into the far corner to make it 1-1.\n\nAfter his goal last week, Antony was introduced off the bench to try and help find the winner for United, and he should've done so with seven minutes to go. Hojlund's effort from the edge of the box was spilt to the feet of the Brazilian by Dean Henderson, but he somehow blazed his shot over the bar, with the clash ending all square.\n\nEA FC 24 predicted final score: Crystal Palace 1-1 Man United\n\nWhat do you think the final score will be? Let us know in the comments!\n\nFollow the MEN's United coverage on TikTok and YouTube, and subscribe to the Manchester is Red podcast", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType":

Jean-Philippe Mateta has scored a goal in each of the five matches played at Selhurst Park since Glasner took the reins.\n\nWhen you take a closer look, things are more impressive. Mateta has 45 touches in the opponent's penalty area in the 10 matches since Glasner took the job, scoring eight times in the process.\n\nSeven of those goals have come at home, and they've come from just 13 shots. He's put nine of those attempts on target, and only Cole Palmer and Alexander Isak have more goals over their last five home contests than Mateta. In both his last two home outings, he's notched a brace.\n\nHe may not need a high volume of shots to find a goal, but he'll likely see plenty of opportunities to fire away against Manchester United. The Red Devils have conceded the fourth-most shot attempts against this season and have been very fortunate they've conceded the fewest goals per shot in the league.\n\nIn their draw with Burnley last weekend, they conceded 16 shots -- a low number for them -- but gave up just one goal. That was a penalty late in the match, despite a 2.06 xG for their opponents. Palace won the earlier meeting 1-0 despite having just eight shots, and Mateta has shown he only needs one good chance to capitalize.\n\nCasemiro was filling in as a makeshift central defender alongside Harry Maguire, making multiple mistakes while being dribbled past twice with Maguire being much more solid in defense. But Maguire's season might be over, meaning Casemiro will likely partner with an elderly Jonny Evans -- fresh off an injury of his own.\n\nWhen you consider Mateta's form and take into account the matchup he's facing, the odds of him scoring should be closer to +125. Luckily for us, TonyBet's giving +150 for him to find the back of the net, and I'll take that number all day.\n\nWhile Mateta's only taken 13 shots at home in those five matches, teammate Eberechie Eze has taken 18. He's managed 12 shots in total over Palace's last two matches, and I like him to get at least three against the Red Devils.\n\nI also see Palace coming away with the win. They're riding a three-match win streak including a win at Anfield over Liverpool, during which they've outscored their opponents 8-2.\n\nManchester United's gutted by injuries and have limited options coming off the bench, and I think they're ready for the season to be over. I'll take the team at home in better form with a better attack.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nCrystal Palace: Jefferson Lerma M (Out), Eberechie Eze F (Probable), Cheick Doucoure D (Out).\n\nMan United: Harry Maguire D (Out), Raphael Varane D (Out), Lisandro Martinez D (Out), Marcus Rashford F (Doubtful), Luke Shaw D (Out), Anthony Martial F (Out), Scott McTominay M (Questionable), Jonny Evans D (Questionable).", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdoulaye_Doucour\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Evans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha\u00ebl_Varane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapha\u00ebl Varane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/9f695b92-79a7-4860-84a5-8ee678ddfaac.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536843", "eventUri": "eng-9536843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 430, "textEnd": 435}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Sam Johnstone, Rob Holding and Matheus Franca though, with the quartet in no condition to take part at Selhurst Park.\n\nThe impressive Adam Wharton should continue in central midfield, providing the energy and spark for the talented trio ahead of him to do their thing against a United defence who like to ensure their goalkeeper Andre Onana has plenty to do.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted lineup: Henderson; Munoz, Clyne, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell; Wharton, Hughes; Olise, Mateta, Eze.\n\nTen Hag pointed to United's terrible injury record in a recent interview, when asked why he's not been able to deliver the same level of resullst achieved in his first season in charge.\n\nThe casualty room is as full as ever heading into the final few games, with the list of unavailable defenders pretty staggering. Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia and Willy Kambwala are all out, with veteran Jonny Evans also not in great shape.\n\nFurther forward there's likely to be no Marcus Rashford, while doubts remain over how just fit midfield duo Bruno Fernandes and Scott McTominay are.\n\nMan Utd predicted lineup: Onana; Dalot, Evans, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka; Casemiro, Mainoo; Antony, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund.\n\nThere's rarely a dull moment watching Manchester United and it should be a pretty even game that's contested on Monday night.\n\nPalace have stepped up their game to move away from danger and are playing far more freely under the management of Oliver Glasner. They will fancy their chances of raining shots down on Onana's goal, putting the Cameroonian further in the spotlight.\n\nUnited can be sharp at the other end when they want to be, and with a fifth-place finish still possible because of Tottenham's recent poor form, they should have enough in the tank to reply and take home at least a point.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType":

The likes of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise being back from injury is a huge boost and Jean-Philippe Mateta has been banging in goals for fun. Palace are keen to finish this season well to take positive momentum into the summer as they prep for next season.\n\nManchester United have been hit hard by injuries all season long but that's no excuse for some of the turgid displays they've put in recently. Erik ten Hag is fighting for his future as United boss and even though they're in the FA Cup final against Manchester City on Saturday, May 25, finishing outside the top six would be a woeful league position for this United side.

Lewis-Potter starred in his final season at Hull City scoring 13 goals. Souttar was one of Australia's best players in the Qatar World Cup before a \u00a315m move from Stoke to Leicester, while Brighton broke their record transfer fee to sign Pedro.\n\nThey have only had fleeting moments in their Premier League beginnings, something that can't be said about Crystal Palace's most recent Championship addition Adam Wharton, who has not just settled well since switching Blackburn for south London but has appeared as one of Oliver Glasner's best performers in recent weeks.\n\nPalace recently won three games in a row for the first time under the Austrian and at the start of that streak at Anfield, against a title-pushing Liverpool, Wharton announced himself. It was a performance from the young midfielder who belied his age of just 20 years. Indeed, Wharton was playing in a 4-0 defeat against Huddersfield Town four months prior, but he has taken everything in his stride and is a quick learner.\n\nIn that 1-0 win, Wharton dealt with the intensity and aggression, and, in what was the biggest game he has played in his career to date, he looked unnerved on the ball, as he started the move that created Eberechi Eze's goal.\n\nThey followed that win up with convincing displays against West Ham and Newcastle, where again Wharton controlled the midfield battle against Lucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes in both games, players linked with both Manchester City this season.\n\nAs much as his great beginning has been down to his intelligence on the pitch, he also made a smart decision by choosing Crystal Palace as his next destination in his career, with Jurgen Klopp's side, Everton and Newcastle United also reportedly interested in bringing him in.\n\nWharton was a needed asset for Roy Hodgson at the time, after Cheick Doucoure's injury in November left Palace with a gaping hole that needed filling. If he had joined Eddie Howe's side, he would have had a tough time competing with Guimaraes for a starting spot, Amadou Onana is one of Everton's star players, and the high pressure and standards at Liverpool can be a difficult environment for young players to grow.\n\nIn fact, there aren't many better clubs for a young, exciting Championship talent to go to when they are looking to take their first steps into the Premier League. Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze have become Palace's standout players since moving from Queens Park Rangers and Reading respectively.\n\nWharton isn't at the level of his two forwards yet but he has started 11 out of the 12 games since his \u00a322.5m move, with his sole substitute appearance being his debut against Brighton. It was a difficult introduction after replacing Marc Guehi 28 minutes in, as his side lost 4-1 and he was partly at fault for Brighton's third goal.\n\nIt was a rare mistake in his young top-flight career so far, but he has shown character to not just move on from it, but really stamp his authority on a Premier League midfield. His next challenge will be against Manchester United, and bar the Liverpool game, there will be a much larger audience watching, potentially including England manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nWith Uefa increasing the squad size to 26 players for the Euros in the summer, it allows Southgate to bring in players with more unique skill sets. With England possessing a wealth of attacking options, the base of the midfield is a weaker position in comparison.\n\nDeclan Rice is Southgate's trusted defensive midfielder but beyond him, there is a lack of depth with Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold more likely to work alongside the Arsenal midfielder rather than displace him.\n\nKalvin Phillips' underwhelming loan spell at West Ham has left him with a lot to do if he wants to get back into England reckoning, and Kobbie Mainoo, like Wharton, has been impressive since he was given a chance but is still relatively unproven.\n\nIt does leave Wharton with a chance to be used in a back-up role to Rice this summer, and with the 20-year-old facing off against Mainoo on Monday, it could be a good chance for him to prove why he deserves a seat on the plane to Germany over his United counterpart.\n\nSouthgate calling up the 20-year-old would be a surprise, and it wouldn't be controversial to leave him behind but he has given something Palace fans were desperately calling for.\n\n\"I don't really think too much about that\", Wharton admitted, claiming a place in Southgate's squad in Germany would be a \"bonus\".\n\n\"My focus, especially at the moment, is all on Crystal Palace. There's no international break until after the season. So, the next six weeks, whatever it is, I'm all Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I don't really think too much about that\", he admitted. \"My focus, especially at the moment, is all on Crystal Palace. There's no international break until after the season. So, the next six weeks, whatever it is, I'm all Crystal Palace.\"\n\nIn January, the travelling fans displayed a banner in a 5-0 loss to Arsenal reading: \"Wasted potential on and off the pitch. Weak decisions. Taking us backwards.\"\n\nThat message was shown nine days before Palace announced Wharton, and he has proven why Palace have made a great decision to choose him to lead their midfield, even if Southgate doesn't for the time being.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jonny Evans was left alone to mark Mateta before being dribbled past with ease as the Frenchman doubled Palace's lead with a fine strike.\n\n\"It definitely sums up United,\" Smith told Sky Sports. \"Defensively they have been a car crash, they really have. I feel for Jonny Evans really here, faced with a one-vs-one against an inform centre-forward. He just does nothing.\n\n\"And what about that for a strike. Every time they have gone forward they have found encouragement and gaps. They have found United wanting. I cannot believe he has skated through so easily.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher added his thoughts at half-time, saying: \"I spoke about this before the game, and I haev done for the last few months. When Manchester United...the postions the players take up make it almost impossibile to make a pattern of play and make it difficult for the oppositon.\n\n\"So Casemiro steps in, he hasn't really got too many options. It's a bit of a mess and he's out of position, but this is absolutely fantastic.

In a one-off move, Jarred Gillett became the first Premier League referee to have a camera strapped to his head to record his interaction with Manchester United and Crystal Palace stars close up.\n\nThe footage, picked up from the camera and mic attached to Gillett's left ear, wasn't used in Sky Sports' live coverage but will be included in a programme to be screened later in the year 'aimed at offering further insight and education into the demands of officiating in the Premier League'. The teams didn't have to give their permission, but were informed last week.\n\nJarred Gillett became the first Premier League referee to wear a camera during a game\n\nFREEDMAN IN TOON TALKS\n\nUnited's bid to install Dan Ashworth as their new sporting director is having ramifications for Palace.\n\nAlthough Newcastle are playing hardball over United's compensation deal for Ashworth, the hunt for his replacement has led them to Palace director of football Dougie Freedman. Freedman is said to be in talks over a move to the North East.\n\nCrystal Palace director of football Dougie Freedman is in talks over a move to Newcastle\n\nOLISE'S STAR CONTINUES TO RISE\n\nMicahel Olise scored in this fixture for the second season in a row, and it is understood that Newcastle have rekindled their interest in the United target.\n\nCompetition will be fierce for the 22-year-old who, though valued at \u00a360million, has a clause in his contract that can be triggered this summer. Olise is keen to play Champions League football when he leaves Palace. United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool are all admirers.\n\nPalace star Michael Olise continued to enhance his reputation with a superb performance\n\nFIRST FOR RELIABLE FERNANDES\n\nIncredibly, Bruno Fernandes' absence here was the first time he has missed a match through injury in a United career spanning more than four years. By comparison, his replacement Mason Mount was making only his eighth start for United since a \u00a360m move from Chelsea last summer.\n\nBruno Fernandes missed a match through injury for the first time in his United career\n\nUNITED FANS LEFT FRUSTRATED\n\nUnited fans started the game taunting Palace supporters by paying tribute to Eric Cantona, whose infamous kung-fu kick happened here 29 years ago, but they ended the first half venting their frustration at Erik ten Hag's side with cries of 'attack, attack, attack'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

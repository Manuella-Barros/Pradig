Carter is behind bars accused of ignoring court orders after he was convicted of domestic violence", "body": "EXCLUSIVE\n\nOne-time NRL rising star Paul Carter is behind bars after he allegedly failed to commence court-ordered community service for domestic violence crimes.\n\nThe serial offender was spared jail last December after he admitted spitting in his ex-girlfriend's face three times during an alcohol-fuelled night of mayhem.\n\nCarter - who was sacked by three clubs during his playing career - had been placed on community correction orders, instead of being locked up.\n\nBut police allege Carter breached those orders by making no attempt to undergo the 140 hours of community service he was ordered to perform.\n\nThe 31-year-old, whose father is Penrith Panthers premiership winner Steve Carter, was due to face Sydney's Waverley Local Court on Tuesday but did not show up.\n\nMagistrate Jacqueline Milledge issued an arrest warrant after learning Carter had allegedly not attended three community service appointments.\n\nOnetime NRL rising star Paul Carter (pictured) is behind bars after he allegedly failed to commence court-ordered community service for domestic violence crimes\n\nCarter was arrested on Wednesday and was brought back before Ms Milledge who refused him bail and ordered he return to court on Friday.\n\nMs Milledge said on Tuesday that despite Carter telling another magistrate in March he would report for community service, he had yet to present himself to work off any of the 140 hours.\n\n'Not even an hour,' she said, before issuing a warrant for Carter's arrest.\n\nCarter had been arrested in August 2022, two days after he attacked his former partner in his parents' home at Moonee Beach near Coffs Harbour on the NSW mid-north coast.\n\nWhile being apprehended, the footballer verbally abused police officers, using the bizarre derogatory terms 'f***ot fingers b***h', 'melon-headed ****' and 'devon-head b***h'.\n\nCarter, who was sacked by the Roosters, Titans and Rabbitohs, pleaded guilty in November to domestic violence-related common assault, contravening a restraining order and resisting or hindering police.\n\nPaul Carter (pictured) was spared jail last December after admitting spitting in his ex-girlfriend's face three times during an alcohol-fuelled night of mayhem the year before\n\nWaverley Local Court heard Carter, his current partner and his ex-girlfriend had gone to Moonee Beach for a family christening at the time of the assault in July 2022.\n\nDuring the gathering, the victim overheard Carter and his father make a series of derogatory comments about another relative's drinking habits, according to court papers.\n\nCarter, who played lock, hooker and second-row at his various clubs, was confronted by his ex-girlfriend and a 'verbal and physical altercation ensued'.\n\nCourt documents revealed Carter was 'enraged', saying words to the effect of 'you're a f***ing s*** [or] c***' and spitting in the victim's face approximately three times.\n\nHe then caused bruising by holding the woman's hand with 'significant force', and pushed her head, causing more bruising and swelling.\n\nThe victim left the Moonee Beach residence the next morning with a child she shares with Carter, before reporting the attack to police a day later.\n\nPolice took photos of her injuries, which 'remained quite noticeable.'\n\nOn the same evening, police attended Carter's Randwick home in Sydney's eastern suburbs where his current partner answered the door.\n\nPolice heard Carter call out and he became aggressive when they told him he was under arrest.\n\nOne officer was injured while police were attempting to handcuff the retired player.\n\nCarter pleaded guilty in November to domestic violence -related common assault, contravening a restraining order and resisting or hindering police\n\nWhen the case came to court Magistrate Ross Hudson noted Carter had been on bail for about 16 months and had committed no offences while at liberty.\n\nMr Hudson also observed that 'spitting on someone is an absolutely disgusting act'.\n\nThe court heard Carter had a job in excavation and had a previous issue with alcohol.\n\n'I am of the view ... there are good reasons ... not to impose a custodial sentence,' Mr Hudson said, while stressing that domestic violence 'will not be tolerated.'\n\nCarter was convicted of each offence and placed on a 12-month community correction order for resisting police.\n\nHe was given a two-year community correction order for the AVO contravention as well as for the common assault and ordered to complete 140 hours of community service.\n\nCarter, who played 40 NRL games across four seasons from 2014 to 2017, has had repeated brushes with the law in the past decade.\n\nIn 2018, Carter was placed on a two-year good behaviour bond after pleading guilty to supplying cocaine to ex-Sydney Roosters winger Shaun Kenny-Dowall at Sydney's Ivy nightclub the previous year.\n\nWhen on the books of the Titans in 2014, Carter sacked after two drink-driving charges in six months.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType":

In the filing, Carter's legal team claimed that Ruth was \"desperate for her two minutes of fame.\"\n\n\"Ruth's goal was simple -- gain as much attention as possible in hopes that Carter would be canceled. For a brief moment it worked,\" the filing read. \"ABC canceled the Backstreet Boys' Christmas special, A Very Backstreet Holiday, and Carter was left fighting for his innocence and his family. Now, over a year later, Carter has obtained all of the evidence necessary to prove that he has been telling the truth all along -- he did not rape Ruth or anyone else for that matter.\"\n\nCarter's lawyers alleged that Ruth, along with other women accusing him of sexual assault including Melissa Schuman and plaintiff identified as A.R. have \"orchestrated\" the allegations as part of a \"plan to garner fame and extort Carter out of money.\" Carter and his team also accused Ruth of fabricating her testimony, claiming it was a \"factual impossibility.\"\n\nNick Carter's Ups and Downs Through the Years: Legal Trouble and More\n\nUs has reached out to Ruth, Schuman and A.R. for comment.\n\nIn December 2022, Ruth sued Carter for sexual battery and accused him of assaulting her following a 2001 Backstreet Boys concert. Ruth claimed the musician invited her to join him on his tour bus while she was waiting in line for an autograph after the show, per docs obtained by Us. She alleged that Carter exposed himself to her and had her perform oral sex on him \"under duress.\"\n\nCarter vehemently denied the allegations. \"This claim about an incident that supposedly took place more than 20 years ago is not only legally meritless but also entirely untrue,\" the musician's rep told Us in a statement in December 2022. \"Unfortunately, for several years now, Ms. Ruth has been manipulated into making false allegations about Nick - and those allegations have changed repeatedly and materially over time. No one should be fooled by a press stunt orchestrated by an opportunistic lawyer - there is nothing to this claim whatsoever, which we have no doubt the courts will quickly realize.\"\n\nAt a hearing in Las Vegas in March 2023, a judge ruled that Carter could file a counterclaim against Ruth after he alleged that she falsely accused him in an extortion attempt.\n\nABC Pulls Backstreet Boys' Holiday Special Amid Nick Carter Assault Claims\n\nRuth is not the only person to accuse Carter of sexual assault. Last year, Schuman, who was a singer for the girl group Dream, also sued Carter for sexual assault and battery. In the lawsuit, Melissa claimed that Carter allegedly performed oral sex on her and made her do the same to him despite her protests before he raped her.\n\nWhile Melissa filed the lawsuit in 2023, she first made the allegations in a 2017 blog post and filed a police report the following year. Carter's lawyer, Liane K. Wakayama, denied Schuman's accusations in a statement to Us.\n\n\"Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 -- and it still is,\" the April 2023 statement read. \"A judge in Nevada recently ruled, after reviewing the extensive evidence we laid out, that there are strong grounds for Nick Carter to proceed with his lawsuit against Ms. Schuman for plotting to damage, defame and extort Nick, his associates, his friends and his family.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Carter-Killmaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Carter-Killmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(American_singer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shannon (American singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Schuman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Schuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holiday (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstreet Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterclaim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterclaim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_us_weekly_474/e13be509e1aa21e3212090dc5fa8ff06", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551303", "eventUri": "eng-9551303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 224, "textEnd": 229}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 731, "textEnd": 736}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Carter also filed a motion for a hearing and requested a summary judgement on Ruth's lawsuit.\n\nCarter's motion also names Melissa Schuman, a former singer with the band Dream, her father Jerome, the @ElaineMoo account on Twitter, and YouTuber Alexa Nikolas. Schuman sued Carter for sexual assault and battery in April 2023.\n\nRuth sued Carter for sexual battery in December 2022 \"for sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\" She claimed that she was assaulted by Carter on his tour bus following a Backstreet Boys concert in 2001 when she was 17-years-old. Ruth further claimed she was given an alcoholic drink and that Carter gave her HPV as a result of the assault.\n\n\"Every single allegation of sexual assault against him has been orchestrated by Melissa Schuman, Jerry Schuman, Ashley Repp and Ruth as part of their plan to\n\ngarner fame and extort Carter out of money. Carter has refused to meet any of their demands and remains steadfast in exposing these people for who they really are, con artists and criminal cohorts,\" the filing read.\n\nElsewhere, the filing mentioned that Ruth testified her best friend at the time, Eleanor Brewer, would corroborate her account. \"Eleanor, however, testified\n\nthat none of that was true and that she had never attended any medical appointment with Ruth. Importantly, the evidence confirms that Ruth tested negative for HPV based on her own medical records,\" the filing read.\n\n\"Eleanor also testified that the first time she learned that Ruth was claiming she was raped was when Ruth reached out to her in 2020 wanting her to testify against Carter.\"\n\nIn his filing, Carter disputed Ruth's claim based in part on the band's schedule of the day. Band management and the group's security team at the time -- a total of 9 individuals -- confirmed the band did a \"quick out\" following the concert and were transported swiftly from the venue to their hotel. These details were also backed up by Susan Riggs, a friend of Carter's, as well as an online review of the concert posted on the Backstreet Boys' website at the time.\n\nTom Hudak, the tour manager for the group at the time, testified, \"Ms. Ruth's claims that Nick Carter remained at the venue and invited her onto his\n\ntour bus is false. Once again, all of the band members, including Nick Carter,\n\nimmediately exited the venue after each show. Moreover, fans did not have access\n\nto the tour bus staging area, which was guarded by several security guards at all\n\ntimes, so it would have been impossible for her to get on his tour bus before the\n\nbuses left together.\"\n\nCarter has further claimed \"Ruth was coached and groomed by Melissa and\n\nJerome Schuman [and] Ruth did not claim that Carter sexually assaulted her until the Schumans had their claws in her for ten months.\"\n\nThe filing stated, \"Carter is entitled to summary judgment in this case and should not be forced to proceed to trial in a matter where the plaintiff has failed to produce a shred of reliable evidence to support her claims.\"\n\nA summary judgement would result in a judge issuing a ruling without taking the case to trial by jury, and Ruth's legal team will be required to share their evidence with Carter's.\n\nCarter was also sued for sexual assault in August 2023. In that filing, a claimant by the name of A.R. alleged that Carter assaulted her multiple times on a yacht and once on a tour bus.\n\nMelissa Schuman previously came forward with her claim against Carter in 2o17 in a since-deleted blog post. She accused Carter of raping her in 2003 in his home in Santa Monica. She was 18 and a virgin at the time.\n\nCarter strongly denied her allegation. He said, \"I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman's accusations.

In the filing, Carter's legal team claimed that Ruth was \"desperate for her two minutes of fame.\"\n\n\"Ruth's goal was simple - gain as much attention as possible in hopes that Carter would be canceled. For a brief moment it worked,\" the filing read. \"ABC canceled the Backstreet Boys' Christmas special, A Very Backstreet Holiday, and Carter was left fighting for his innocence and his family. Now, over a year later, Carter has obtained all of the evidence necessary to prove that he has been telling the truth all along - he did not rape Ruth or anyone else for that matter.\"\n\nCarter's lawyers alleged that Ruth, along with other women accusing him of sexual assault including Melissa Schuman and plaintiff identified as A.R. have \"orchestrated\" the allegations as part of a \"plan to garner fame and extort Carter out of money.\" Carter and his team also accused Ruth of fabricating her testimony, claiming it was a \"factual impossibility.\"\n\nNick Carter's Ups and Downs Through the Years: Legal Trouble and More\n\nUs has reached out to Ruth, Schuman and A.R. for comment.\n\nIn December 2022, Ruth sued Carter for sexual battery and accused him of assaulting her following a 2001 Backstreet Boys concert. Ruth claimed the musician invited her to join him on his tour bus while she was waiting in line for an autograph after the show, per docs obtained by Us. She alleged that Carter exposed himself to her and had her perform oral sex on him \"under duress.\"\n\nCarter vehemently denied the allegations. \"This claim about an incident that supposedly took place more than 20 years ago is not only legally meritless but also entirely untrue,\" the musician's rep told Us in a statement in December 2022. \"Unfortunately, for several years now, Ms. Ruth has been manipulated into making false allegations about Nick - and those allegations have changed repeatedly and materially over time. No one should be fooled by a press stunt orchestrated by an opportunistic lawyer - there is nothing to this claim whatsoever, which we have no doubt the courts will quickly realize.\"\n\nAt a hearing in Las Vegas in March 2023, a judge ruled that Carter could file a counterclaim against Ruth after he alleged that she falsely accused him in an extortion attempt.\n\nABC Pulls Backstreet Boys' Holiday Special Amid Nick Carter Assault Claims\n\nRuth is not the only person to accuse Carter of sexual assault. Last year, Schuman, who was a singer for the girl group Dream, also sued Carter for sexual assault and battery. In the lawsuit, Melissa claimed that Carter allegedly performed oral sex on her and made her do the same to him despite her protests before he raped her.\n\nWhile Melissa filed the lawsuit in 2023, she first made the allegations in a 2017 blog post and filed a police report the following year. Carter's lawyer, Liane K. Wakayama, denied Schuman's accusations in a statement to Us.\n\n\"Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 - and it still is,\" the April 2023 statement read. \"A judge in Nevada recently ruled, after reviewing the extensive evidence we laid out, that there are strong grounds for Nick Carter to proceed with his lawsuit against Ms. Schuman for plotting to damage, defame and extort Nick, his associates, his friends and his family.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Carter-Killmaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Carter-Killmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Schuman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Schuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Backstreet Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(American_singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shannon (American singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holiday (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ednbo3/picture288427347/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/daedece8-161a-4896-a20d-7fda53150402", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551303", "eventUri": "eng-9551303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 284, "textEnd": 289}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Ruth, who claimed she was 17 at the time, alleged Carter spiked her drink before sexually assaulting her in the bathroom and then again on his bed.\n\nBut Carter claims Ruth's lawsuit has been orchestrated by former Dream singer Melissa Schuman, who in April 2023 also sued him, claiming sexual assault and battery. Carter claims Ruth and Schuman's lawsuits are part of a coordinated effort \"to garner fame and extort Carter out of money.\" Carter claims he refused to meet their demands and that is why he's now facing these lawsuits.\n\nIn a statement to ET, Ruth's attorney, Christian M. Morris, Esq., says, \"Ms. Ruth disagrees with much of the information that is contained in Mr. Carter's motion for summary judgment. She looks forward to being able to express her side of the story in her opposition.\"\n\nCarter points to Ruth's deposition, in which he claims she was asked to provide information about the alleged rape \"but she was unable to provide any details aside from what her lawyers wrote for her in her complaint and interrogatory responses.\" The singer claims Ruth testified approximately 146 times that she \"did not remember\" and 64 times that she \"did not know.\"\n\nRuth claimed in her lawsuit that she contracted HPV as a result of the alleged rape. Carter claims in his court documents that Ruth claimed in her deposition that her best friend could corroborate the story because they attended the concert together and the friend accompanied her to a clinic afterward. But the best friend, Carter claims, \"testified that none of that was true and that she had never attended any medical appointment with Ruth.\"\n\nCarter goes on to claim that \"evidence confirms Ruth tested negative for HPV based on her own medical records.\"\n\nAs for the \"factual impossibility,\" Carter claims the reason \"Ruth was unable to remember or know details of the alleged rape is because the evidence confirms that it would have been a factual impossibility ... from security guards to fans, 9 different witnesses all testified that the Backstreet Boys immediately left the concert venue that evening.\"\n\nWhat's more, Carter claims that just days after that February 2001 concert, \"a fan posted a review on the Backstreet Boys' fan site detailing her experience leaving the concert early and following the tour buses on the highway to the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seattle, Washington\" where soon after \"Carter was spotted exiting his tour bus and heading into the hotel.\"\n\nAccording to the court docs, \"It is therefore a factual impossibility for Carter to have stayed at the Tacoma Dome after the concert to sign autographs, then invite Ruth onto his tour bus and engage in what she claims was a protracted rape that first took place in the bathroom and then in the bedroom.\"\n\nThe court docs also claim that \"Ruth herself admitted in sworn statements to law enforcement on multiple occasions that she was not raped by Carter as well as in a private conversation with [a friend] in October 2019,\" and alleging that \"Ruth let slip at her deposition that she does 'not know' if she is having false memories of Carter raping her because she is confusing a rape that allegedly happened at the hands of her ex-husband.\"\n\nAs for any medical records that would bolster Ruth's case, Carter claims \"the only medical records produced by Ruth in this case start in January 2020 -- almost 20 years after the alleged February 2001 incident.\"", "source":

In the filing, Carter's legal team claimed that Ruth was \"desperate for her two minutes of fame.\"\n\n\"Ruth's goal was simple -- gain as much attention as possible in hopes that Carter would be canceled. For a brief moment it worked,\" the filing read. \"ABC canceled the Backstreet Boys' Christmas special, A Very Backstreet Holiday, and Carter was left fighting for his innocence and his family. Now, over a year later, Carter has obtained all of the evidence necessary to prove that he has been telling the truth all along -- he did not rape Ruth or anyone else for that matter.\"\n\nCarter's lawyers alleged that Ruth, along with other women accusing him of sexual assault including Melissa Schuman and plaintiff identified as A.R. have \"orchestrated\" the allegations as part of a \"plan to garner fame and extort Carter out of money.\" Carter and his team also accused Ruth of fabricating her testimony, claiming it was a \"factual impossibility.\"\n\nUs has reached out to Ruth, Schuman and A.R. for comment.\n\nIn December 2022, Ruth sued Carter for sexual battery and accused him of assaulting her following a 2001 Backstreet Boys concert. Ruth claimed the musician invited her to join him on his tour bus while she was waiting in line for an autograph after the show, per docs obtained by Us. She alleged that Carter exposed himself to her and had her perform oral sex on him \"under duress.\"\n\nCarter vehemently denied the allegations. \"This claim about an incident that supposedly took place more than 20 years ago is not only legally meritless but also entirely untrue,\" the musician's rep told Us in a statement in December 2022. \"Unfortunately, for several years now, Ms. Ruth has been manipulated into making false allegations about Nick - and those allegations have changed repeatedly and materially over time. No one should be fooled by a press stunt orchestrated by an opportunistic lawyer - there is nothing to this claim whatsoever, which we have no doubt the courts will quickly realize.\"\n\nAt a hearing in Las Vegas in March 2023, a judge ruled that Carter could file a counterclaim against Ruth after he alleged that she falsely accused him in an extortion attempt.\n\nRuth is not the only person to accuse Carter of sexual assault. Last year, Schuman, who was a singer for the girl group Dream, also sued Carter for sexual assault and battery. In the lawsuit, Melissa claimed that Carter allegedly performed oral sex on her and made her do the same to him despite her protests before he raped her.\n\nWhile Melissa filed the lawsuit in 2023, she first made the allegations in a 2017 blog post and filed a police report the following year. Carter's lawyer, Liane K. Wakayama, denied Schuman's accusations in a statement to Us.\n\n\"Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 -- and it still is,\" the April 2023 statement read. \"A judge in Nevada recently ruled, after reviewing the extensive evidence we laid out, that there are strong grounds for Nick Carter to proceed with his lawsuit against Ms. Schuman for plotting to damage, defame and extort Nick, his associates, his friends and his family.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Schuman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Schuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Backstreet Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Carter-Killmaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Carter-Killmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(American_singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shannon (American singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nick-carter-tg-890.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1326px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551303", "eventUri": "eng-9551303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 207, "textEnd": 212}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

YouTuber and former actress Alexa Nikolas was also subpoenaed.\n\nRuth -- who sued Carter for sexual battery in December 2022 -- alleges she was assaulted as a teenager more than 20 years ago, an incident that a source close to the singer has denied.\n\n\"Ms. Ruth disagrees with much of the information that is contained in Mr. Carter's motion for summary judgment,\" her lawyer Mark Boskovich told PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. \"She looks forward to being able to express her side of the story in her opposition.\"\n\nRelated: Nick Carter Sued in Third Sexual Assault Case as Lawyer Says They're 'False Allegations'\n\nRuth claimed that when she was 17 years old the pop star, then 21, sexually assaulted her on his tour bus after a concert at the Tacoma Dome in 2001, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. TMZ and Rolling Stone were the first to report the suit.\n\nIn the most recent filing, Carter provides evidence disputing Ruth's claim with security personnel and band management confirming that Backstreet Boys did a \"quick out\" after a concert where she was allegedly waiting in an autograph line. (The singer's team claims no such line existed.)\n\nSusan Riggs, a friend of the band and Carter at the time, testified that she \"personally observed Carter exit the venue, board his tour bus and immediately drive away,\" while Ashley Large, a fan, went to a meet-and-greet prior to the show, but claims there was no autograph line after the show.\n\nAdditionally, fans confirmed that Carter was immediately transported to the Four Seasons Hotel in Seattle shortly after the concert.\n\nCarter's lawyers claim that Ruth has been unable to recall several details from the incident in question including details about a beverage called a \"VIP Drink\" she was allegedly served, how much time had passed from between going from the bus to the bathroom where she claimed to be assaulted and how Carter told her to \"orally copulate him.\"\n\nThe \"As Long as You Love Me\" singer also claims the accuser lied about him giving her HPV and about identifying his security guard who she claimed let him on his tour bus. Also, he noted in the filing that Ruth's claims that she had been diagnosed with and was suffering from autism and cerebral palsy were unsupported.\n\nCarter asserts that Ruth was \"coached and groomed\" by Melissa and Jerome and that Ruth had admitted on social media and in her deposition that she was not sexually assaulted by the boybander.\n\n\"Carter is entitled to summary judgment in this case and should not be forced to proceed to trial in a matter where the plaintiff has failed to produce a shred of reliable evidence to support her claims,\" the filing argues.\n\nThe musician is asking that Ruth's \"perjurious testimony\" is disregarded by the Court.\n\n\"Based on the actual and significant evidentiary record, Carter did not rape Ruth and her moving target story does not create a genuine issue where a reasonable jury would return a verdict in her favor,\" the motion states.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the

alleged sexual battery.\n\nA source close to Nick denied the allegations.\n\nIn February 2023, Nick filed a countersuit against Ruth for her accusations, and in that countersuit, he also sued Schuman regarding the allegations she made against him.\n\nThe countersuit argued that the two women took advantage of the #MeToo movement and used it to launch a five-year conspiracy to \"defame and vilify Carter and otherwise ruin his reputation for the purposes of garnering attention and fame and/or extorting money from Carter,\" according to the suit obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nNick was sued by a third accuser who claimed he assaulted her at age 15 in August 2023.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by PEOPLE, he allegedly sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 2003.", "source": {"uri":

She looks forward to being able to express her side of the story in her opposition.\"\n\nThe motion also named former Dream singer Melissa Schuman, who accused the 44-year-old star of raping her in his apartment in 2003 when he was 22 and she was 18, her father Jerome Schuman, and the @ElaineMoo Twitter account. In addition, YouTuber Alexa Nikolas has been subpoenaed.\n\nShannon had alleged she was sexually assaulted in 2001 when she was 17 and the 'I'll Never Break Your Heart' singer was 21, and claimed the incident took place on the group's tour buss after a concert at the Tacoma Dome in Washington.\n\nHowever, in his new filing, Nick provided evidence disputing the allegation, with Backstreet Boys' management and members of the security team confirming the group did a \"quick out\" after the concert when his accuser was allegedly waiting in an autograph line.\n\nSusan Riggs, a friend of the band at the time testified she \"personally observed Carter exit the venue, board his tour bus and immediately drive away\", and fan Ashley Large, went to a meet-and-greet prior to the show, but stated there was no autograph line after the show.\n\nFans also confirmed Nick was taken to the Four Seasons Hotel in Seattle shortly after the concert ended.\n\nThe 'As Long As You Love Me' singer claimed his accuser was unable to recall several details about the night, including how much time had passed between her getting on the tour bus and going to the bathroom, where she alleged the assault took place, and how he supposedly told her to \"orally copulate him\".\n\nNick also claimed his accuser lied about getting HPV from him and about identifying his security guard who she claimed let him on his tour bus, and noted her statement she had been diagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy were unsupported.\n\nHe believes the accuser was \"coached and groomed\" by the Schumans and claimed she had admitted on both social media and in her deposition that she was not sexually assaulted.\n\nHis filing argued: \"Carter is entitled to summary judgment in this case and should not be forced to proceed to trial in a matter where the plaintiff has failed to produce a shred of reliable evidence to support her claims.\"\n\nNick wants the woman's \"perjurious testimony\" to be disregarded by the court.\n\nHe added: \"Based on the actual and significant evidentiary record, Carter did not rape Ruth and her moving target story does not create a genuine issue where a reasonable jury would return a verdict in her favour.\"", "source": {"uri": "femalefirst.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Femalefirst"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Just in the last few weeks, there have been numerous pro-Palestine protests at the university, with approximately 40 people arrested during the protests including numerous students, who've called on the university to cut ties with Israel.\n\nIn addition, a woman tragically died Sunday during the commencement ceremony after falling out of the stadium. The university also received mixed reactions to the chosen commencement speaker.\n\nDuring Carter's testimony to the Ohio Senate Workforce and Higher Education Committee, he spoke about the successes of the university. He said in 2023, the university's annual economic impact for the state is estimated to be around $19.6 billion dollars with 80% of the graduates staying in Ohio to work.\n\nHe said the university is submitting requests for $76.5 million for maintenance projects across their campuses for the fiscal year 2025-26. This funding would be used to update buildings on the Columbus campus and all of the branch campuses.\n\nCarter also addressed challenges on college campuses including student debt, enrollment, and declining faith in the value of a college education.\n\nHe also spoke about pro-Palestinian protests happening on campus' across the nation and at Ohio State University.\n\nOn April 25, 40 people including 18 students were arrested at a protest on Ohio State's campus. There has been criticism about the university's response to these protests.\n\nCarter is standing firm in saying he believes the university handled the protests correctly.\n\n\"We also made it very clear that there weren't going to be any encampments or people spending the night, and not that I was worried about whether they could do it peacefully as we didn't have the security force to protect them,\" Carter said.\n\nSeveral times, Carter said the arrests were not about limiting free speech, but about intentionally violating university rules. He said the response to keep people safe.\n\n\"Those security forces took more stuff hitting at them than the other way around. They had bottles of urine thrown up and bottles of water thrown at them,\" Carter said. \"We had to use extra security forces, which our campus police are not large enough to do. That's why we asked for some support from the State Highway Patrol, and they came in and again, no batons, no pepper spray, no tasers, only defensive gear.\"\n\nCarter said he is committed to free speech and believes in it himself.\n\nFollowing Carter's presentation, the head of the Senate committee said to him the university's response to the protests should be used as an example.\n\nThis week, Ohio's attorney general brought to light a 70-year-old law meant to target the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe law makes it a fourth-degree felony for two or more people to commit a crime together while wearing a mask.\n\nCarter said he was not aware of this law until recently, and said the university is looking at it but not taking any particular action at this time.\n\nCarter also addressed the process for choosing the speaker for the 2024 commencement ceremony calling him non-traditional.\n\nThe speaker was Christopher Pan, a social entrepreneur who admitted on social media to taking psychedelic drugs to help write his speech, which Carter said he does not endorse.\n\nCarter said Pan, an Ohio State graduate, had been on the university's radar for several years as a potential commencement speaker.\n\n\"A lot of that was going on well before I even showed up in the job, so, yes, he's somebody that was known to the university,\" Carter said. \"He'd been on a list, yes, he did get invited to come speak. I did not review his speech. I did not know what he was really going to speak about. And again, wouldn't matter, because once you get to the microphone, he's got the microphone. That was certainly an interesting speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbc4i.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC4i"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_hoffman@nbc4i.com", "name": "Anna Hoffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Ohio_State_University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of presidents of Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Statehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Statehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCMH-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WCMH-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Highway patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.nbc4i.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2024/05/Ted-Carter.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551303", "eventUri": "eng-9551303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft had her career derailed by injuries and off the court issues.\n\nIn 2021, an elbow injury and a suspension due to conduct \"deemed detrimental to the team\" effectively ended her time with the Atlanta Dream. Carter is grateful to be back in the league.\n\n\"Honestly, it's crazy to be out of the league and then be somewhere you're wanted, loved and appreciated,\" Carter said.\n\nTalent was never in question with Carter; it was always about how she fit in with a team dynamic. Now, with coach Teresa Weatherspoon, Carter is confident she's found a spot where she can showcase her talent and her authentic self.\n\n\"This moment is a little bit surreal,\" Carter said. \"Sitting out six months, seeing myself come back to Chicago, come here and be embraced and show my talent. It's amazing. I wasn't able to be me in a lot of places.\"\n\nThe last portion of Carter's response is most prevalent. Carter said she learned how to be a leader and how to channel her emotions better after going overseas. Carter plays with a chip on her shoulder, which meshes well with the group Weatherspoon has assembled.\n\nIt's likely that Carter will make the roster as the May. 13 cut-down date looms. Aside from talent, Carter has formed a bond with Weatherspoon, connecting with the coach's player-first philosophy.\n\nCarter said Weatherspoon reminded her of former Atlanta Dream head coach Nicki Collen because of how the two coaches connect with players. From her introductory press conference, Weatherspoon has harped on connecting with players first and foremost.\n\n\"I want them to be able to learn,\" Weatherspoon said. \"I want to know them as a person. It's important for me to have a relationship with each player. I want to know what makes you go or what your why is. It makes it easier for me to keep you there to hold you accountable to it.\"\n\nWhat's allowed Carter and Weatherspoon's relationship to get off to a burgeoning start is Weatherspoon giving her player's grace and not being judgemental.\n\n\"Kennedy is grasping this thing,\" Weatherspoon said. \"She's running with it. She has a great group of young women she's surrounded with and loves her.\"\n\nCarter's value to the Sky is through her offensive talent. She's a skilled guard with a knack for scoring. Even as she's played sporadically throughout the first seasons of her career, one constant is her scoring ability. Carter averaged 16.1 points during her two years in Atlanta.\n\nBut the talent was always there. Having a coach who believes in her can allow Carter to live up to the talent she possesses.\n\n\"I just play loose,\" Carter said. \"I feel like I can really be me. I'm not worried about getting pulled out of the game; I'm not worried about if I'm doing too much.\n\n\"She [Weatherspoon] really allows me to be me, not even just in a basketball aspect, but the person Chennedy Carter. A lot of people don't have anyone who took the time to really get to know me. So just to be myself around the team every day and just pour into these girls. I'm thankful that I'm here.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicki_Collen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicki Collen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

There were some that liked it and a lot that didn't,\" Carter told reporters Wednesday following a hearing at the Ohio Statehouse.\n\nPan, a 1999 alumnus and social entrepreneur, and Carter share an interest in Bitcoin. Carter, who started as Ohio State's president in January, has served on Bitcoin miner TeraWulf, Inc.'s board since 2021. But he told reporters that the connection played no role in Pan's selection as commencement speaker. Carter said Pan was selected from a list of recommended speakers and had been considered for the role since 2019.\n\n\"There's absolutely no connection whatsoever,\" Carter said. \"I'd never met him before. I did not know anything about him\" until a dinner the night before commencement.\n\nPan posted on LinkedIn that he \"got some help from AI (Ayahuasca Intelligence),\" a psychedelic liquid, in crafting his commencement speech.\n\n\"Whatever drugs he did use, I hope they were prescribed,\" Carter said Wednesday. \"I certainly wouldn't endorse that.\"\n\nNote: This story includes a discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.\n\nFor many at the commencement, the speech was overshadowed by a tragic death.\n\nLarissa Brady, 53, of Woodstock, Georgia, died after falling from Ohio Stadium in an apparent suicide, according to the Franklin County Coroner's Office.\n\nCarter said he learned about the fall shortly before going on stage and chose not to mention it during the commencement.\n\n\"We didn't have all the information,\" said Carter, who offered his sympathies to the Brady family. \"Out of respect for that family, who I knew was somehow connected to graduation, I thought it very inappropriate to say anything about it until we had more facts.\"\n\nStudents across the nation have protested Israel's military actions in Gaza and called for universities to divest from Israel. About three dozen people were arrested at an April 25 demonstration on Ohio State University's campus.\n\nCarter told reporters that he didn't want protesters to stay overnight - not because he thought they couldn't do so peacefully, but because Ohio State didn't have enough police to protect them. He reiterated the importance of free speech while commending police officers for how they handled the situation.\n\n\"I'm actually proud of what the security force had to endure to remove those tents,\" Carter said. \"We didn't want to arrest anybody. We didn't want to go through any of that, but when it became apparent that they were going to go to whatever level they wanted to stay there, we had to use extra security forces.\"\n\nSen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, who leads the Senate Workforce and Higher Education Committee, commended Carter for his response to the protests, saying it should serve as an example to other universities nationwide.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost recently advised university presidents about an obscure law that makes it a felony to commit a crime with two or more people while wearing white caps, masks or other disguises. Carter said he hadn't heard of the law until Yost brought it to his attention.\n\n\"We'll take a look at it but we're not doing anything or taking any particular action out of it,\" Carter said.\n\nCarter also answered lawmakers' questions about Ohio State University's diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which comprise 0.37% of the university's budget. Carter said that money goes toward compliance with federal Title IX programs, assistance for students with learning disabilities and culturally competent pediatric dental care.\n\n\"My commitment to you is that we will continue to serve students of all backgrounds and in all circumstances, whether urban or rural, first-generation, parenting students, veterans and more,\" Carter said.\n\nThe hearing comes as Ohio lawmakers consider Cirino's Senate Bill 83, a sweeping higher education overhaul that would ban mandatory diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nOther proposed changes would require annual faculty evaluations, mandate that course syllabuses be posted online, require an American government or American history class to graduate and add training for university trustees. The Ohio Senate passed the bill, 21-10, in May 2023, but it hasn't received a full House vote.\n\n\"We just don't want to support programs that are divisive in nature,\" Cirino told Carter.\n\nCarter said Ohio State University has a world-class faculty with diverse opinions already. He emphasized the importance of higher education as a path to a more informed citizenship - even as some lose faith in the value of universities for a variety of reasons.\n\n\"The simple truth of it is we're here to not tell students what to think but how to think,\" Carter said.\n\nOhio State University is asking lawmakers for $76.5 million for maintenance projects, including partial demolition of Evans Laboratory and other HVAC, elevator and fire system repairs. Founded in 1870, 48% of Ohio State's buildings are at least 50 years old or older.\n\nLegislators will vote on money for Ohio State and other projects in a capital budget in the coming weeks.\n\nDispatch reporters Sheridan Hendrix and Max Filby contributed to this article.\n\nJessie Balmert is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch,

He has completely denied these allegations, including ones made by Ashley Repp, that were backed up by his own brother, Aaron Carter.\n\nA new documentary finds Nick and his late brother scrutinized for the first time by all of the women who have alleged abuse by the Backstreet Boys member's hand.\n\nBut let's look at some background first.\n\nBack in 2017, as you may recall, singer Melissa Schuman accused the Backstreet Boys member of drugging her and of assaulting her when she was a teenager in 2003.\n\nAfter that, several other women came forward with similar allegations.\n\nOne of them was Ashley Repp. In 2019, Ashley posted on Twitter that Nick had raped her, a startingly accusation, made only more compelling when Nick's brother, Aaron.\n\nWhile her account has since been deleted, you can still see messages Aaron posted at the time, sharing the same claims on his own Twitter.\n\nBy recirculating these accusations, Nick filed a restraining order against his younger brother, an act that at the time didn't seem to bother Aaron.\n\n\"I stand by you all,\" Aaron posted on his Twitter in 2019. \"Justice will be served on a cold platter! I'm the lion Of my family\" He tagged not only Ashley on that message, but other accusers like Melissa and Kaya Jones, Nick's ex.\n\nIn February 2018, the Santa Monica Police Department confirmed that it had opened an investigation into Nick after Melissa came forward with these allegations.\n\n\"I'm finally doing what I thought I could no longer do. Im filing a police report,\" the former member of the pop group Dream said at the time, adding the hashtag #MeToo and crediting the Rape Abuse Incest National Network for \"empowering me to take this step.\"\n\nNick immediately responded back then, denying all of her allegations:\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman's accusations.\n\n\"Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally.\n\n\"This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.\"\n\nIn December 2022, meanwhile, a woman named Shannon Ruth and three Jane Does filed a lawsuit against Carter in Nevada... the former of whom claimed that Carter drugged and raped her on his tour bus after a 2001 concert in Washington.\n\nSince then, all has been quiet. But that is about to dramatically change.\n\nCarter and his late brother Aaron will be the subject of a documentary on Investigation Discovery that will deep dive into all of the accusations against the brothers.\n\nTitled \"Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter;\" the two part docuseries will air Monday, May 27, and Tuesday, May 28, and will shockingly include interviews with Melissa Schuman, Ashley Repp and Shannon Ruth, all of whom have alleged sexual assault by Nick.\n\nAlso interviewed will be an unnamed \"member of the Carter family,\" as well as friends including Nick's ex-girlfriend Kaya Jones and Aaron Carter's former fianc\u00e9, Melanie Martin.\n\nThe series is expected to investigate these accusations of sexual assault against Nick Carter by numerous women... and will also dive into younger brother Aaron Carter's struggles with mental health and substance abuse -- leading to his death in 2022.\n\n\"My heart has been broken today,\" said Nick Carter at the time of his brother's passing.\n\n\"Even though my brother and I have had a complicated relationship, my love for him has never ever faded.\n\n\"I have always held onto the hope, that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help that he so desperately needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kay_d_rhodes@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Kay D.

She looks forward to being able to express her side of the story in her opposition.\"\n\nThe motion also named former Dream singer Melissa Schuman, who accused the 44-year-old star of raping her in his apartment in 2003 when he was 22 and she was 18, her father Jerome Schuman, and the @ElaineMoo Twitter account. In addition, YouTuber Alexa Nikolas has been subpoenaed.\n\nShannon had alleged she was sexually assaulted in 2001 when she was 17 and the 'I'll Never Break Your Heart' singer was 21, and claimed the incident took place on the group's tour buss after a concert at the Tacoma Dome in Washington.\n\nHowever, in his new filing, Nick provided evidence disputing the allegation, with Backstreet Boys' management and members of the security team confirming the group did a \"quick out\" after the concert when his accuser was allegedly waiting in an autograph line.\n\nSusan Riggs, a friend of the band at the time testified she \"personally observed Carter exit the venue, board his tour bus and immediately drive away\", and fan Ashley Large, went to a meet-and-greet prior to the show, but stated there was no autograph line after the show.\n\nFans also confirmed Nick was taken to the Four Seasons Hotel in Seattle shortly after the concert ended.\n\nThe 'As Long As You Love Me' singer claimed his accuser was unable to recall several details about the night, including how much time had passed between her getting on the tour bus and going to the bathroom, where she alleged the assault took place, and how he supposedly told her to \"orally copulate him\".\n\nNick also claimed his accuser lied about getting HPV from him and about identifying his security guard who she claimed let him on his tour bus, and noted her statement she had been diagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy were unsupported.\n\nHe believes the accuser was \"coached and groomed\" by the Schumans and claimed she had admitted on both social media and in her deposition that she was not sexually assaulted.\n\nHis filing argued: \"Carter is entitled to summary judgment in this case and should not be forced to proceed to trial in a matter where the plaintiff has failed to produce a shred of reliable evidence to support her claims.\"\n\nNick wants the woman's \"perjurious testimony\" to be disregarded by the court.\n\nHe added: \"Based on the actual and significant evidentiary record, Carter did not rape Ruth and her moving target story does not create a genuine issue where a reasonable jury would return a verdict in her favour.\"", "source": {"uri": "contactmusic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Contactmusic.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)",

YouTuber and former actress Alexa Nikolas was also subpoenaed.\n\nRuth -- who sued Carter for sexual battery in December 2022 -- alleges she was assaulted as a teenager more than 20 years ago, an incident that a source close to the singer has denied.\n\n\"Ms. Ruth disagrees with much of the information that is contained in Mr. Carter's motion for summary judgment,\" her lawyer Mark Boskovich told PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. \"She looks forward to being able to express her side of the story in her opposition.\"\n\nRuth claimed that when she was 17 years old the pop star, then 21, sexually assaulted her on his tour bus after a concert at the Tacoma Dome in 2001, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. TMZ and Rolling Stone were the first to report the suit.\n\nIn the most recent filing, Carter provides evidence disputing Ruth's claim with security personnel and band management confirming that Backstreet Boys did a \"quick out\" after a concert where she was allegedly waiting in an autograph line. (The singer's team claims no such line existed.)\n\nSusan Riggs, a friend of the band and Carter at the time, testified that she \"personally observed Carter exit the venue, board his tour bus and immediately drive away,\" while Ashley Large, a fan, went to a meet-and-greet prior to the show, but claims there was no autograph line after the show.\n\nAdditionally, fans confirmed that Carter was immediately transported to the Four Seasons Hotel in Seattle shortly after the concert.\n\nCarter's lawyers claim that Ruth has been unable to recall several details from the incident in question including details about a beverage called a \"VIP Drink\" she was allegedly served, how much time had passed from between going from the bus to the bathroom where she claimed to be assaulted and how Carter told her to \"orally copulate him.\"\n\nThe \"As Long as You Love Me\" singer also claims the accuser lied about him giving her HPV and about identifying his security guard who she claimed let him on his tour bus. Also, he noted in the filing that Ruth's claims that she had been diagnosed with and was suffering from autism and cerebral palsy were unsupported.\n\nCarter asserts that Ruth was \"coached and groomed\" by Melissa and Jerome and that Ruth had admitted on social media and in her deposition that she was not sexually assaulted by the boybander.\n\n\"Carter is entitled to summary judgment in this case and should not be forced to proceed to trial in a matter where the plaintiff has failed to produce a shred of reliable evidence to support her claims,\" the filing argues.\n\nThe musician is asking that Ruth's \"perjurious testimony\" is disregarded by the Court.\n\n\"Based on the actual and significant evidentiary record, Carter did not rape Ruth and her moving target story does not create a genuine issue where a reasonable jury would return a verdict in her favor,\" the motion states.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nSince 2017, Carter has faced accusations of sexual assault from three women.\n\nSchuman sued Nick for sexual assault and battery in April 2023, while Ruth sued him in December 2022 for alleged sexual battery.\n\nA source close to Nick denied the allegations.\n\nIn February 2023, Nick filed a countersuit against Ruth for her accusations, and in that countersuit, he also sued Schuman regarding the allegations she made against him.\n\nThe countersuit argued that the two women took advantage of the #MeToo movement and used it to launch a five-year conspiracy to \"defame and vilify Carter and otherwise ruin his reputation for the purposes of garnering attention and fame and/or extorting money from Carter,\" according to the suit obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nNick was sued by a third accuser who claimed he assaulted her at age 15 in August 2023.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by PEOPLE, he allegedly sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 2003.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Robby Carter says no but House refuses to create new judgeship", "body": "An attempt to create a new judgeship in the Florida Parishes failed badly Wednesday after the bill's sponsor did not dispel fears among his House colleagues that he was trying to create it for his stepdaughter.\n\nRep. Robby Carter, D-Greensburg, sought to add a new judge elected in a district that mimicked the boundaries of his legislative district.\n\nNoting that his district has a 55% Black population, Carter said he was trying to create a \"minority opportunity\" seat for the 21st Judicial District Court with House Bill 442. The state Judicial Council in February recommended adding a judge to the 21st JDC - which covers Tangipahoa, St. Helena and Livingston parishes - because the judges' dockets now are overloaded, but the council had not specified that it be designed to favor a Black candidate.\n\nCarter noted that he has won his district - as did then-Rep. John Bel Edwards before him - even though he is White, indicating that the district would not guarantee the election of a minority candidate.\n\nCarter then faced a pointed question from Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans.\n\n\"Is it a possibility that a member of your immediate family could run?\" Hughes asked.\n\nCarter replied with a long answer where he eventually said that his stepdaughter Jessica Ledet is planning to run for a juvenile court judgeship that would open next year if the current judge, Blair Edwards, wins a promotion this fall to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeal. (Jessica Ledet is a public defender on juvenile issues in Tangipahoa Parish.)\n\nBut, Carter added, \"I cannot commit to anyone not running.\"\n\nThat answer didn't satisfy Hughes. He noted that Carter said he was trying to establish a new seat that a minority candidate could win and had had minorities speak in favor of HB 442 when it was heard in committee. Hughes then accused Carter of using them as \"props\" to create the seat for his stepdaughter.\n\n\"I'm offended that you'd bring that up,\" Carter replied.\n\nThe House defeated HB 442 on a 28-57 bipartisan vote. The House then rejected House Bill 759 by Carter that would have added a new judgeship for the 21st JDC that would have favored a White candidate.\n\nSeveral House said privately afterward that fears of nepotism sank Carter's minority opportunity bill, and that ill feeling spilled over to the second bill.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_bridges@nola.com", "name": "Tyler Bridges", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robby Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Parishes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Parishes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bel_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bel Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangipahoa_Parish,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Hughes_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Hughes (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Helena_Parish,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Helena Parish, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Helena Parish, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_(administrative_division)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parish (administrative division)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston_Parish,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livingston Parish, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Livingston Parish, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_defender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public defender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/c1/1c1aae96-4af7-5e16-a1bd-09dc6db52f11/629d37cab1c82.image.jpg?crop=1477%2C775%2C0%2C313&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551303", "eventUri": "eng-9551303", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

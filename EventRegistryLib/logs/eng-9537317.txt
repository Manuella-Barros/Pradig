While that gives them more tactical flexibility and a greater backstop for injuries, the 10 venues being used in Germany will have some trouble accommodating larger squads.\n\nEach stadium's benches were prepared under the assumption that teams would only need space for 12 substitutes, not 15. There isn't enough time to make them bigger, so according to the Daily Mail, plans are being put in place for the surplus players to sit near supporters in the stand directly behind.\n\nUEFA has also informed each nation that Germany's dressing rooms were be prepared for 23-man squads, so their stars best prepare for a tight squeeze. Still, Southgate and his peers will be happy that the decision was ratified by UEFA after weeks of talks regarding player welfare after another jam-packed season.\n\nA statement confirmed: \"The UEFA Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming UEFA EURO 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players.\n\n\"The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations. In accordance with the competition regulations, teams must provide UEFA with a list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26 by the deadline of 7 June.\"\n\nSouthgate publicly threw his backing behind squads of 26 in March, with England having suffered a raft of injuries. \"We've got to make the best decisions [regarding selection] with what we know and some of those currently are going to be medical decisions,\" the Three Lions manager explained.\n\nYour turn! Which players should and shouldn't be in England's squad? Give us your picks in the comments section\n\nEngland were hit by injuries in March\n\n\"We've been able to get those right in the previous [two] tournaments. We've been able to give people time [to recover from injuries, having named them in the squad]. But with 23 that's definitely more difficult.\"\n\nSouthgate has already confirmed that he'll name a provisional squad on May 21, two days after the end of the Premier League season. England must then need to submit their final squad by 11pm on June 7, just over an hour after after their final warm-up friendly against \u00adIceland at Wembley.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Unfortunately, three of them were unable to participate and had to settle for spectator status.\n\nEven though they were eligible, players like Sergio Ramos and Leroy Sane have gone unselected in prior big tournaments. The new regulations greatly increase the likelihood that all of the top talents will play.\n\nThis ruling raises the possibility that all future UEFA national tournaments will have 26-player teams. With the European Championships coming up in only six weeks, this will be helpful for national teams coping with injury concerns.\n\nThere has been considerable lobbying by competing nations, who are keen to have as much space in their squad as possible.\n\nKeep in mind that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar also included 26-player groups. This was because, back then, the competition was located smack dab in the center of the domestic season.\n\n\"The UEFA Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming UEFA EURO 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players.\n\nThe increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations\", UEFA have stated.\n\n\"In accordance with the competition regulations, teams must provide UEFA with a list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26 by the deadline of 7 June.\"\n\nPreviously several foreign coaches felt the 23-player rosters were too small. With so many players suffering injuries this season, Ronald Koeman and Gareth Southgate have advocated for a larger roster.\n\n\"It is about the load carrying ability of the players\", said Koeman. Then, Southgate chimed in as well: \"Well, given where we are now [we need 26-man rosters]! We've got to make the best decisions [regarding selection] with what we know and some of those currently are going to be medical decisions.\n\n\"We've been able to get those right in the previous [two] tournaments. We've been able to give people time [to recover from injuries, having named them in the squad]. But with 23 that's definitely more difficult.\"\n\nThe plan to move to 26-player teams got a lot of support at the most recent Euro 2024 coaches meeting, as per BBC.\n\nManagers will feel less pressure as the event approaches (it starts on June 14) thanks to the move. Especially since UEFA had intended to return to the previous 23-man roster limit.\n\nIn addition, the number of players on the Copa America roster will most likely go up from 23 to 26. Official confirmation from CONMEBOL is anticipated shortly.\n\n\"Almost certainly the list for the Copa America is 26 players and not 23, it would be a list like the World Cup. CONMEBOL is soon to confirm it\", said journalist Hernan Castillo.\n\nPhoto credit: IMAGO / Herrmann Agenturfotografie", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_San\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leroy San\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ramos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segundo_Castillo_(footballer,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Segundo Castillo (footballer, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/National_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/National Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240504_WST_505161_Euro2024.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537317", "eventUri": "eng-9537317", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1524, "textEnd": 1530}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2440, "textEnd": 2447}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Lucy Bordwell from Edinburgh was only 10 when she first noticed a rash develop on her body and was rushed to hospital before being diagnosed with Henoch Schonlein Purpura (HSP) - an autoimmune condition which affects blood vessels in the skin, guts, joints and kidneys. The schoolgirl is now recovering well and her mum has praised the NHS team who helped make the experience more 'positive'. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Lucy's mum, Kate said: \"Lucy was 10 in November 2022 when she first got a strange rash. After visiting A&E we were told it was Henoch Schonlein Purpura which is known as HSP. It\u2019s an autoimmune condition which affects blood vessels in the skin, guts, joints and kidneys. \"She is still seeing her consultant regularly. Doctors said most children get better after a few days, but the next day, Lucy became very sick. The rash spread everywhere, so we took her back to hospital. \"She ended up staying in for three weeks because she couldn't keep any food or water down and was losing a lot of weight. She was put on a drip and given steroids. It took her a long time to recover.\" Now, the caring mum is raising money for the Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity - the team that has worked closely with her family over the years. She explained: \"The charity is so amazing because it was Christmas time, Lucy was sad she was missing school concerts, parties, gymnastics and everything else. \"The charity put so much fun stuff on for the kids - there were visits every day with football and rugby clubs, acrobats, ballet dancers, storytellers, magic, brass bands\u2026you name it! There were fun movie nights and a silent disco too. There's always help to cheer you up when you're down. \"Since Lucy has just been a visitor rather than staying we have visited the hub several times to see the therapy dogs and chat. The hospital would be a much scarier place without the charity.\" Kate added that she is \"proud\" of her daughter and hasn't let her condition stop her. She said: \"The hospital stay was difficult for us. It was a horrible time. Lucy was very distressed during treatments and had to have drips and a tube in her nose. What made it bearable were the daily activities provided by ECHC; every day someone came in to do something special. \"It\u2019s hard for an 11-year-old to have a rare autoimmune disease that she can't easily talk to her friends about. And she needs to keep coming to hospital for regular monitoring of her kidneys. \"But she hasn\u2019t let it stop her at all. We\u2019re so very proud of how she\u2019s challenged herself and come straight back. \"It\u2019s been a really difficult time but Lucy\u2019s much better now and the future looks good.\" You can donate to Kate's fundraiser here.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, attends the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday. AP\n\nRepublican senator from Ohio JD Vance, who has been chosen by former President Donald Trump as his running mate for the upcoming presidential election, will become the first vice president in nearly a century to sport facial hair, if elected.\n\nAccording to a New York Post report, the last vice president with a beard as substantial as Vance's was Charles Fairbanks, who served under Teddy Roosevelt from 1905 to 1909, and the last vice president with a moustache was Charles Curtis in 1933 during his time under Herbert Hoover.\n\nVance is one of the few modern-day politicians who doesn't favour the baby-faced look.\n\nWhen Vance first gained national attention with his best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy in 2016, he fell in line with norms and rocked the clean look. However, his beard was in full force when he was elected to the Senate in 2022, becoming one of the few politicians on Capitol Hill with facial hair, added the report.\n\nDespite rumours that Vance's beard could have cost him the vice presidential nomination, Trump dismissed the speculation, telling Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade that the beard was fashionable on his running mate.\n\n\"He looks good,\" Trump said, adding, \"Looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nAccording to New York Post report, citing research, voters associate facial hair with personality traits that politicians typically want to avoid, such as aggressiveness, traditionalism, and anti-feminism.\n\nA 2015 survey by Oklahoma State University found that voters perceive men with beards and moustache as being opposed to reproductive choice and \"more supportive of gun rights, military spending, and the deployment of force\" - characteristics that align with Vance's political stance, added the report.\n\nDonald Trump on Monday announced Vance as his vice presidential pick.\n\nTaking to Truth Social Network, Trump said, \"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio.\"\n\nVance is supposed to help Trump win the Midwest this fall.\n\nBut almost immediately after the Ohio senator was announced as Trump's pick, one thing became clear: Vance, a 39-year-old Republican with less than two years in Congress, is not well-known among many in his party, even in the swing states Trump hopes he'll deliver.\n\nMichigan Republican Party Chairman Pete Hoekstra offered a blunt response when asked about Trump's pick minutes after it was announced: \"We don't know him.\"\n\nTrump's team now has less than four months to strengthen Vance's profile in the states that matter most this fall in his 2020 rematch against Democratic President Joe Biden. Already, a collection of political foes -- Democrats and Republicans -- is working to fill the void by seizing on Vance's inexperience in government, his nationalist views and his critical comments about Trump himself.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_W._Fairbanks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles W.

English in 1880, though a handful of others since have had beards and no moustache, or some other form of facial hair. Charles Curtis was the last vice president (between 1929 and 1933) to sport any facial hair at all: a neat moustache.\n\nVance was announced as Trump's pick for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Monday, following a lengthy selection process that involved several high-profile candidates, including North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Both clean shaven.\n\nSocial-media users jumped on this milestone for bearded lawmakers, praising Vance's breaking of the \"beard barrier.\"\n\nVance's achievement comes despite Trump's reported distaste of beards. \"Trump is a clean-shaven guy. He just doesn't like facial hair,\" an unnamed \"Trump confidant told the Bulwark recently when discussing the vice presidential selection process.\n\nAnd former U.N. ambassador John Bolton missed out on a place in Trump's cabinet in 2017 because of his moustache, The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nHowever, Trump said in a recent Fox News interview that he had no issue with Vance's beard. \"He still looks good, he looks like a young Abraham Lincoln,\" the former president said.\n\nLincoln was the first presidential candidate with a beard to win an election, with subsequent presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, and Benjamin Harrison all following in his footsteps. Hayes in particular was recognized for having one of the largest beards of any president.\n\nThe last president to have any kind of facial hair was Republican William Howard Taft, who sported an impressive moustache during his presidency from 1909 to 1913. Fellow Republican Thomas E. Dewey was the last presidential candidate on a major party ticket to have facial hair. He ran twice for the presidency in the 1940s and lost.\n\nVance was elected to the senate in 2022 after a career as a venture capitalist. He is also the author of Hillbilly Elegy, a 2016 memoir based on his upbringing in a working-class family that reflected on the social, economic and cultural pressures facing the Appalachian community he grew up in. It was well received and later adapted into a film of the same name.\n\nTrump highlighted Vance's appeal in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in his decision.\n\nThe Ohio senator's nomination was well received by many of Trump's biggest supporters, such as conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, who said, \"JD Vance is President Trump's Vice President pick. A great choice by Trump. Let's win this thing!\"\n\nSimilarly, Colorado Republican and outspoken Trump supporter Lauren Boebert said: \"\"AMERICA is going to be SO GREAT AGAIN!

J.D. Vance Would Be the First Since 1933.", "body": "It's no secret that Donald Trump has an aversion to facial hair.\n\nFamously attuned to appearances, the former president once told his son, Donald Trump Jr., to ditch his pandemic beard. He was believed to have considered scruff a negative while selecting members of his administration in 2016. His distaste is so well-known that when Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) was reported to be on his vice-presidential shortlist, reporters pressed Trump on whether he could deal with the firebrand senator sporting a beard.\n\nWhen the Republican presidential aspirant announced Vance as his running mate on Monday, it wasn't a big step just for him. It was also a big step for the United States, which hasn't had a vice president or vice-presidential candidate with facial hair in decades. The last one was the mustachioed Charles Curtis, who was on the Republican ticket in 1932 with Herbert Hoover.\n\nIn other words, Vance, the nation's first millennial major party nominee, managed to also break the \"beard barrier,\" or the long-held norm of only clean-shaven politicians vying for the highest office in the land. And, for the record, Trump told Fox News Radio he thinks his running mate looks good with a beard - \"like a young Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nMatty Conrad, a master barber and founder of Victory Barber & Brand, told The Washington Post that Vance's scruff could mark a return to a century-old run of bearded politicians. It also reflects shifting style sensibilities.\n\n\"Facial hair is certainly no stranger to the Oval Office, though it's been seen as unprofessional and unkempt for a long time,\" he said. \"But what we've seen, certainly within the last probably 15 years or so, has been a return to more of that kind of rougher, more masculine kind of appearance.\"\n\nThe swing from smooth-faced Founding Fathers, to hairy mid-19th century leaders, to today's mostly scruff-free White House contenders coincides with historical trends, according to research by Christopher R. Oldstone-Moore, a historian and author of \"Of Beards and Men: The Revealing History of Facial Hair.\" Hairy faces were reviled during George Washington's age of powdered wigs. The Civil War coincided with a fad of lush beards - which began fading away around the beginning of the 20th century, when rumors began swirling about facial hair spreading diseases.\n\nA look through presidential and vice-presidential portraits, along with records from the Library of Congress, reveals the changing grooming trends. Aside from John Quincy Adam's elongated sideburns and Martin Van Buren's mutton chops, the first president to have facial hair was Lincoln - who famously grew his beard after an 11-year-old girl sent him a letter in 1860 with some aesthetic advice: \"All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husband's to vote for you and then you would be President.\"\n\nHonest Abe, who served from 1861 to 1865, seems to have started a trend. After Lincoln, nine of the 11 next presidents sported some sort of beard or 'stache - a streak that ended with William Howard Taft, who was in office from 1909 to 1913.\n\nVice presidents somewhat followed suit. The first with any facial hair was Schuyler Colfax, veep for fellow beard-haver Ulysses S. Grant from 1869 to 1873. Over the next 14 elections, seven men with facial hair - mostly mustaches - featured on the winning ticket, through Curtis in the 1928 election.\n\nCurtis and Hoover lost their bid for reelection four years later. No nominee for Veep has had facial hair since, and only two presidential nominees have: Charles Evans Hughes in 1916 and Thomas E. Dewey in 1944 and 1948. Both Republicans lost their races - and, in Dewey's case, the mustache might have been part of the problem. It was something observers fixated on.\n\n\"They made the comment that Dewey looked like the groom figurine on the wedding cake,\" said Joel K. Goldstein, the Vincent C. Immel Professor of Law Emeritus at St. Louis University School of Law. \"And that was kind of a cutting comment.\"\n\nGoldstein, an author and scholar of the vice presidency, has admittedly not devoted much of his work to studying politicians' facial hair - or lack thereof. But he said he was not surprised by the onslaught of attention Vance's beard has brought to this year's presidential race. Personal appearance, he said, has long played a role in politics.\n\n\"Just look at the JFK versus Nixon debates. People who watched the debates thought that Kennedy had won, and people who listened on the radio thought that Nixon had won. And that's a function of Kennedy's appearance,\" Goldstein said.\n\nAnd, he added, there's something about novelty that can be alluring to the public.\n\n\"It's like when you look at all the black-and-white presidential pictures, and suddenly around 1953 you see them in color,\" he said. \"Or when all the vice presidents are men and all of the sudden you see Harris. It's different and it's striking.\"\n\nConrad, the master barber, said Vance's beard underlines how the pendulum has swung back in favor of facial hair. He said that a well-kept beard today can serve as a confidence booster - \"even if before it was viewed as hippie or yuppie or for slobs and mountain guys.\" He described it as the equivalent of the makeup technique known as contouring, in that it can help define and shape a face.\n\nFor Vance, the beard is what Conrad said he \"would call a maturity beard.\" The vice-presidential hopeful was smooth-faced and had a boyish look when he rose to fame in 2016 after publishing the memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" He stayed that way for years, before debuting the full beard while running for Senate in 2022.\n\nNeither the Trump campaign nor a spokesperson for Vance responded to The Post's request for comment on the VP pick's facial hair. Vance does not appear to have gone on the record about it. But the beard has been a source of public fascination for years, with some seeing it as a sign of his transformation from \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author and \"Never Trumper\" to one of the 45th president's fiercest allies.\n\nEven one of Vance's law school friends said the new look \"occupied an outsize amount of my attention,\" The Post reported in a 2022 magazine piece.\n\n\"He looks different,\" the friend said. \"He's going for a kind of severe masculinism thing. He looks like Donald Trump Jr.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facial hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Nothing should be taken seriously. Except for the beards.\n\nOn Monday, July 15th, former President Donald Trump announced that he had selected Republican Senator James David Vance from Ohio as his running mate. Given that I base my political judgments solely on a candidate's facial hair, lack thereof, or another personal or physical trait, I was pleased when Trump selected Vance and announced that decision on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nMy first reaction to Senator JD Vance being selected was pride. Vance happens to be a fellow Marine, serving from 2003-2007 with a short, six-month tour in Iraq with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing as a combat correspondent Marine. Granted, Vance was not a \"grunt\" but rather a POG (Person Other than Grunt), and he still wore the uniform of the best branch of the armed forces. The Marine Dress Blue uniform has been giving ugly Marines a chance with the prom Queen since 1775, and these are facts.\n\nIn addition to his status as a Marine Veteran, Senator JD Vance is one of the very few men in national politics with a full beard; yes, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) technically counts with his mutton-chops-looking beard, but it is a beard nonetheless. But it is Vance who has broken down the follicle front door of politics. While Vance's facial forest is no Paul Bunyan, he will potentially be the first vice president in the history of the United States with a full beard. No, VP Schuyler Colfax (serving under President Ulysses S. Grant) technically did not have a full beard, as his upper lip lay barren and isolated, unprotected, and exposed to the elements.\n\nNothing says more than a strong man with a strong beard to accompany him, I'm not saying that a clean-shaven man is not strong -- or am I? Some men on this planet are blessed with the ability to grow a beard, or at least a well-populated goatee or mustache, while some are destined to live their lives as follicly-challenged individuals, with faces representing a baby's bottom, lacking the armor that beards provide. It has been scientifically proven that beards can provide more protection in a fistfight than a cleanly-shaven mug. The Nobel Prize-winning study conducted by University of Utah biology professor David Carrier in 2020 found that beards act almost as natural armor.\n\nThey determined that \"fully furred samples\" were capable of absorbing more energy than samples that had been plucked or sheared.\n\n\"Peak force was 16% greater and total energy absorbed was 37% greater in the furred compared to the plucked samples. These differences were due in part to a longer time frame of force delivery in the furred samples. These data support the hypothesis that human beards protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes,\" according to the team's research article, which was published in the journal Integrative Organismal Biology in April 2020.\n\nI have worn my beard for the past 12 years, having decided long ago that because I am bald (I lost all my hair in Iraq, and now my head hair lives vicariously through my face), I must maintain facial greatness much to my wife's chagrin, as she is not a huge fan, but has succumbed to the realization that she just has to accept the fact that I will not shave it.\n\nWhile I personally believe that I maintain a much better, eloquent, and warrior-esk man-mane than Senator JD Vance, he still maintains a respectable amount of facial coverage. Vance now has a solemn responsibility and the duty to maintain his beard for the sake of continuing to give voice to the voiceless of political beards, especially from the strong and capable conservative men. He cannot fold to the pressure of those who would say beards have no place in the political arena, as I was once told by a friend of mine. I was and still am contemplating a run for my local school board, and he confided in me that I had to shave my beard if I was to have any chance of getting elected. The thought of shaving my beard never entered my mind and it should never enter the mind of Senator Vance.\n\nVance must not fold to any pressure to shave his beard, for if he folds on his sacred duty to protect his beard, I shall fold on my vote to elect him and Donald Trump. Protecting the good of the beard is more important than anything else, as we need to make beards great again. We need to bring this nation back to the times of Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, and James Garfield, where beards were not just worn by men, they were celebrated. Do the right thing, Senator Vance, keep the beard, and you can keep my vote.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_funicello@redstate.com", "name": "Matt Funicello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Marine_Aircraft_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2nd Marine Aircraft Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuyler_Colfax", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schuyler Colfax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Vance, Breaking the Beard Barrier", "body": "When J.D. Vance took to the stage of the Republican convention Wednesday night to officially accept the vice-presidential nomination, he did so in a dark blue suit and an ocean blue tie -- a \"boy from Middletown, Ohio,\" as his wife, Usha, said in her introduction, who had become \"a powerful example of the American dream.\" Not to mention the first millennial on a major party ticket.\n\nHe looked the part, except for one thing. One unmistakable detail that -- in the style of his running mate, Donald J. Trump -- not only upended modern political wisdom, but broke a longstanding political taboo.\n\nHis beard.\n\nThe last bearded man elected president of the United States was Benjamin Harrison, in 1888. The last president with any facial hair whatsoever was William Howard Taft, elected in 1908. The last vice president with a mustache was Charles Curtis, who was Herbert Hoover's veep. And the last major party candidate to try to break that clean-shaven streak was Thomas E. Dewey, who had a dapper little caterpillar on his upper lip and ran, unsuccessfully, for the highest office in 1944 and 1948.\n\nHis campaign set a bad precedent. According to the National Archives blog \"Pieces of History,\" Mr. Hoover once said of Mr. Dewey's 'stache, \"A man couldn't wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind.\"\n\nEver since, a clean-shaven face has defined the status quo in the corridors of power of Washington and Wall Street. At least until now.\n\nFacial hair is often seen as suspicious. Facial hair hides something -- maybe something even more telling than a weak chin. It suggests subterfuge. Neatly trimmed, it has been associated with the demon Mephistopheles, who was often pictured with a goatee, and Dracula. When left unchecked, it recalls rebels like Fidel Castro, and hippies.\n\n\"Shaved faces were a mark of urbanity and good grooming,\" said Richard T. Ford, a professor at Stanford Law School and the author of \"Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History.\" \"Beards became associated with rural lifestyles ('mountain men'), old men, college professors and the counterculture. None of those associations were likely to appeal to a mass electorate.\n\n\"The counterculture vibe was especially problematic,\" he continued, \"but the other associations suggested either a lack of good breeding or a dubious eccentricity.\"\n\nIt didn't help that politicians who lost their races and appeared to be experiencing something of a long, dark night of the soul sometimes expressed their crises by disappearing -- and then reappearing with beards.\n\nAl Gore did it in 2001, after the Supreme Court ruled that George W. Bush had won the presidency. Paul Ryan did it in 2015, when he announced he would not seek the presidential nomination. Ted Cruz did it in 2016, after the end of his run for president. Beto O'Rourke did it in 2019, after his try for the highest office. Even Mitt Romney, though still in office, seemed to display his alienation from his party by getting, literally, bristly, in 2022.\n\nAs David Letterman told The New York Times of why he grew his own enormous beard after leaving \"Late Night,\" \"The beard is a good reminder to me that that was a different life.\" It can be either a badge of failure or one of renunciation.\n\n\"It's also a way of rebranding,\" Mr. Ford said. \"I'm back, but I'm not the person you remember.\"\n\nThis all speaks to why Mr. Trump himself is famously anti-beard, telling his son Donald Jr. on his podcast, \"Triggered,\" that he preferred him without the facial hair. Perhaps to suggest he really is his own man, Don Jr. has kept his beard, which he first grew during a hunting and fishing trip in 2018.\n\nAs he wrote on Instagram: \"I brought back some scruff as a souvenir. Maybe I should keep it??? LMK your thoughts. #scruff #beard #mountainman.\" Photos suggested that by Christmas he had shaved, but the beard reappeared in early 2019 and has been his trademark ever since.\n\nCoincidentally, that appears to be about the same time Mr. Vance grew his beard, though the precise moment is harder to pinpoint. When Mr. Vance was on the promotional trail for his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" in 2016 and 2017, he was clean-shaven, but by the time he ran for the Senate in 2022, the facial hair was fully in place. His look, like his politics, had changed.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump telling Fox Radio that he thought the beard made Mr. Vance look \"like a young Abraham Lincoln,\" it doesn't really look much like Lincoln's beard. That beard came without a mustache and was altogether less groomed, and it was reportedly grown, said Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton University, because an 11-year-old girl told Lincoln in 1860 that it would help him get elected by hiding the thin, cadaverous nature of his face.\n\nMr. Vance's beard, by contrast, works to give the candidate, who has something of a round baby face, both a jawline and an overall air of he-manship.\n\nAnd Mr. Vance's beard, like Donald Trump Jr.'s, is more in the tradition of the spaghetti western beard. It is closer to Clint Eastwood's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" beard (which, as it happens, Mr. Trump has celebrated on his Instagram), than the beards of any political forebears.\n\nFor Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump, who are known to be friends, their beards suggest not just two men on the same page, but the pioneer West, a land where men were men and men shot bears.\n\nFor a long time, that was considered a potential liability in politics. According to research by Rebekah E, Herrick of Oklahoma State University published in the Scholars Strategy Network, voters may \"see men with beards and mustaches as less feminist and more supportive of gun rights, military spending and the deployment of force.\"\n\nIn the MAGA world, however, where gender stereotypes can be a virtue, the N.R.A. is a friend, and qualities like \"toughness\" and \"masculinity\" are celebrated, such beard clich\u00e9s may work in Mr. Vance's favor.

Lincoln's certainly did. \"By 1863, three members of his cabinet had beards: Edwin Stanton, Gideon Welles and Edward Bates,\" Mr. Wilentz said. Thereafter (and with the exception of Andrew Johnson), \"six presidents in a row, counting Grover Cleveland just once, were either bearded or heavily hirsute.\"\n\nStill, Mr. Wilentz said, despite a flurry of excitement among beard-buds on social media, \"it's going to take a lot for Vance to shift the trend should he get into office.\" In fact, Mr. Vance's sudden promotion to beard role model at a time of great division in the country could have the opposite effect.\n\nEric Calvo, a 27-year-old communications professional, recently grew a beard that he was pretty happy with until this week, when a friend told him it made him think of Mr. Vance.\n\n\"That was the social death knell for me,\" Mr. Calvo said. \"I shaved it off Tuesday night at 10:30 p.m.\"\n\nAnd given all the history, perhaps Mr. Vance will do the same. \"He'll probably do a poll to see if he stays or shaves,\" Mr. Wilentz said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facial hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Herbert Hoover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Counterculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dracula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election, we've written reams about the senator and what he brings to the ticket. I wanted to highlight something about Vance that resonates with me, and it's something that no candidate has brought to any ticket since 1880.\n\nThere has been a certain look that all male candidates for higher office have cultivated for generations. Smooth-shaven and clean-cut has been the template for presidential and vice-presidential material throughout most of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThe last vice president with any facial hair at all was Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover's VP from 1929 to 1933. Curtis rocked a mustache throughout his time in office.\n\nASIDE: Curtis was the first mixed-race individual to serve as president or vice president. His mother was Native American, and his father was white. (Sorry, Barack and Kamala.)\n\nBut you have to go back even further to find a vice presidential candidate with a full beard. That was William Hayden English, who was the running mate of Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock in 1880. The Scott-English ticket lost to James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was the last president to have a full beard. Harrison was a Republican who served in the White House from 1889 to 1893. In 1948, Thomas Dewey was the last presidential candidate to have a mustache.\n\nNewsweek also notes that Vance's beard is a contrast to Trump's dislike of facial hair. Reportedly, Trump denied John Bolton a cabinet position because of his walrus 'stache.\n\nHowever, the former president may have changed his tune when it comes to Vance's beard, telling a Fox News Radio interviewer, \"He still looks good, he looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nAs a man with a full beard, I welcome a bearded candidate to the vice-presidential race.

who said the Republican nominee and former President has a well-known distaste towards facial hair.\n\nGoing against the grain, he has now chosen Ohio senator JD Vance as his VP pick, who has become the first person with a beard to be on a US presidential ticket since 1892.\n\nOn Moncrieff today, Mr Fletch said beards are not a common feature of high-level politicians worldwide.\n\n\"In the UK, the last bearded prime minister goes back to 1902,\" he said.\n\n\"There has been this culture in politics of clean-shaven men, sometimes men with no hair on top of their heads as well.\n\n\"Certainly, hair of any kind doesn't seem to have been terribly popular amongst senior politicians in many cases for a very long time indeed.\"\n\nFletch said there's a stereotype associated with bearded men.\n\n\"People think that people with beards are hiding something under their beard and are therefore untrustworthy,\" he said.\n\n\"People think that they've got the remains of their breakfast in their beard or something like that, and maybe they have in a few cases.\n\n\"I also think there has been an association of a certain lifestyle with beards, whereas now these are all stereotypes.\"\n\nHe said JD Vance has been growing his beard for \"three or four years now\".\n\n\"It's difficult because Trump has a long record of not liking beards, though his son has had one for quite a while now,\" he said.\n\n\"If Trump were to have a beard, it would be grey if he grew it naturally, so that wouldn't look good with his orange hair, so he'd have to dye the beard orange too.\"\n\nMr Fletch said UK politicians have also had misgivings about facial hair.\n\n\"Blair was not keen on beards and never had one, but he did have bearded people in his cabinet,\" he said.\n\n\"He had Robin Cook, Frank Dobson, and David Blunkett, so he was a little bit more 'live and let live' about it.\n\n\"When it comes to the current PM, Keir Starmer is a great fan of hairdressers, and his hair is a work of art.\n\n\"But he's never had a beard, despite the fact his father was a long-time beard wearer.\"", "source": {"uri": "newstalk.com", "dataType": "news",

Dr Sermed Mezher cautioned: \"Beards may look fun, but fun always has a price,\" he further revealed images of a woman whose chin had acquired a scaly texture from 'making out with a stubble-faced chap'.\n\nAccording to Dr Mezher, the culprit was a bacterial skin infection known as impetigo. In his own words: \"In this case, that was a bacterial skin infection known as impetigo...And, at the risk of shooting myself in the foot, beards can be a fairly common cause.\"\n\nThe NHS explains that impetigo often begins with red sores or blisters that eventually turn into a brown or golden crust.\n\nRead more: Doctor says everyone should take 4c pill from age of 8 every day to avoid dementia\n\nRead more: 'Common' summer practice can make painful varicose veins 'much worse'\n\nUnfortunately, these are much more painful than the cornflakes their appearance is often likened to.\n\nDr. Mezher elaborated on how beard-triggered impetigo happens, saying: \"The reason for that is that the small hairs in the beard can actually cause tiny little holes in the skin which can cause bacteria to enter - especially, if the man has poor beard hygiene.\", reports Gloucestershire Live.\n\nSpecifically, the skin could become infected with 'Streptococcus pyogenes' or 'Staphylococcus aureus', with the latter bacteria often linked to sneezing and coughing.\n\nBack in 2018, an eye-opening study from Manchester Metropolitan University unveiled that nearly half of all male beards contain traces of faecal matter. This surprising finding held true even when most of the participants confirmed they had washed their beards with soap on the same day they were tested, with participants sporting various beard lengths and styles.\n\nThis implies that even shorter beards and stubble are teeming with bacteria.\n\nTo avoid this facial hair catastrophe, experts suggest washing a beard two to three times per week with water and beard shampoo. Some hair shampoos are also safe for use on the beard, but it's crucial to read product labels for more information.\n\nA representative for Fragrance Direct, which commissioned the survey, previously told Cambridgeshire Live: \"Caring for your beard is essential for its health, helping it stay fresh to keep the bacteria at bay.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows to shampoo their hair, but beards need some attention too. Men should use beard shampoo when they shower, along with conditioner afterwards.\"\n\n\"Between washes, beard serum can be used to keep it in good condition and the keep hair soft and well-groomed.\"\n\nJoin RSVP Live's WhatsApp community to get celebrity news and our top stories", "source": {"uri": "rsvplive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "rsvp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mezher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ali Mezher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impetigo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impetigo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skin infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hirsutism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pyogenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streptococcus pyogenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Varicose veins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_(blood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serum (blood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staphylococcus aureus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shampoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facial hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.rsvplive.ie/life/article33285389.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-90433927-170667a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9735959", "eventUri": "eng-9735959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Bush and Bill Clinton didn't torpedo their eventual victories in November.\n\n\"When [Bush] picked a lightly regarded Dan Quayle, the instant pundits were saying, 'oh my God, this is going to sink his campaign,' and of course he went on to win big against Michael Dukakis,\" Lichtman told Newsweek. \"When Bill Clinton picked Al Gore it was: 'Ah, what a terrible pick, another Bubba, you know, a neighboring state, he's not going to help him at all.' And of course, Clinton achieved a great upset of defeating a sitting president: George H.W. Bush.\"\n\nVance also runs counter to the conventional political strategy of selecting a running mate who could generate new electoral votes in November, Lichtman said. Ohio has voted Republican in the last two elections.\n\n\"Even if you were thinking about picking someone who is politically helpful, at least the methodology would be to pick up someone from a key swing state,\" Lichtman said. \"[Trump] didn't do that.\"\n\nJust 12 percent of U.S. adults said Trump's selection of Vance was his \"best possible\" pick, according to a YouGov survey conducted Monday. Thirty-seven percent said they weren't sure, compared to 9 percent who deemed Vance the \"worst possible\" choice.\n\nAnother YouGov survey conducted Monday also found Vance to be a relative unknown on the national stage -- with 43 percent of respondents indicating they're unsure of their opinion of a senator whose political rise followed his 2016 bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy.\n\nOverall, 28 percent of those polled have a positive opinion of Vance, putting him 44 among Republicans -- just below former Texas governor and White House hopeful Rick Perry, according to YouGov data.\n\nThomas Whalen, a presidential historian and associate professor of social sciences at Boston University, characterized Vance as an \"outside of the box\" selection for Trump\n\n\"He's doubling down on his base -- on his MAGA, kind of blue-collar, aggrieved white people base,\" Whalen told Newsweek of Trump. \"But in the bigger picture, I think it's a missed opportunity because when you're running for president, you want to expand your existing base of supporters.\"\n\nWhalen suggested former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who was Trump's final GOP primary challenger, would've been a savvier selection.\n\n\"A lot of moderate Republicans that Nikki Haley represents, not to mention moderate Republican women who favor women's reproductive rights, have a lot of questions about Donald Trump,\" Whalen said. \"I think it's a swing and a miss.\"\n\nThe 'Beard Barrier'\n\nWhalen acknowledged one factor that might work in Vance's favor is the so-called \"beard barrier,\" referring to the conventionally clean-shaven faces of presidents and vice presidents. If elected, Vance would be the first VP with a beard since Republican Schuyler Colfax (1869-1873) and the first VP with facial hair since Republican Charles Curtis (1929-1933) sported a mustache.\n\n\"Well, it matters, at least in modern political history,\" Whalen said. \"Harry Truman had a field day against Thomas Dewey in 1948, and remember that was a year Republicans were supposed to establish a red wave as well.\"\n\nPresidents with facial hair\n\nDewey, the last major presidential candidate on a major ticket with facial hair, ran for the White House in 1944 and 1948, but lost both elections.\n\nThe most recent commander-in-chief with an unshaven look was Republican William Howard Taft (1909-1913), who wore a mustache, Whalen noted.\n\n\"We've been pretty clean-shaven,\" he said. \"And remember, on the Republican right - everyone with short hair and clean shaven -- it's always been kind of a cultural badge for conservatives. So, this has cultural resonance here and I'm not sure if he'll keep that facial hair. It'll be interesting to see.\"\n\nLarry Cook, an author and presidential historian, believes Vance's beard could be an asset that won't be going away anytime soon.\n\n\"Beards are kind of in, beards are popular again,\" Cook told Newsweek. \"And it gives people something else to talk about. That's helpful. If somebody's talking about their beard, they might talk about Trump and Vance. I think it can only help him if people are talking about it one way or another.\"\n\nLichtman, meanwhile, told Newsweek he expects to make his 2024 presidential election prediction after the Democratic National Convention in August while downplaying any impact Vance's beard could potentially have.\n\n\"I don't want to stretch and make pronouncements about things that are not central,\" Lichtman said. \"The whole point of my keys to the White House is to keep your eye on the big picture, ignore the day-to-day, don't pay attention to the polls and look at the big picture, which is the strength and performance of the White House party.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_rhett_miller@newsweek.com", "name": "Joshua Rhett Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George H.

It's often compared to having cornflakes stuck to your skin, but sadly, these are much more painful.\n\nFor beard-triggered impetigo to occur, the skin will be infected with 'Streptococcus pyogenes' or 'Staphylococcus aureus' - with latter bacteria often associated with sneezing and coughing. Dr Mezher explained: \"The reason for that is that the small hairs in the beard can actually cause tiny little holes in the skin which can cause bacteria to enter - especially, if the man has poor beard hygiene.\"\n\nIn 2018, a shocking study from Manchester Metropolitan University also unveiled that almost 50 per cent of male beards have traces of faecal matter. Most participants claimed they had washed their beards with soap on the day this was tested, and beards were of varying lengths and styles.\n\nThis means that even shorter beards and stubble are teeming with bacteria.\n\nTo sidestep this hairy predicament, experts suggest washing a beard two to three times a week using water and specialised beard shampoo. Certain hair shampoos can also do the trick for beards, but it's crucial to peek at product labels for specifics.\n\nA spokesman for Fragrance Direct which commissioned the survey previously told Cambridgeshire Live: \"Caring for your beard is essential for its health, helping it stay fresh to keep the bacteria at bay.\n\n\"Everyone knows to shampoo their hair, but beards need some attention too.

UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement that she wished Conille \u201cevery success in bringing much-needed peace, stability and hope to the children of Haiti.\u201d Conille was not the first choice for some council members. In late April, a four-member coalition within the council made an unexpected announcement that they had chosen former sports minister Fritz Belizaire as prime minister. The move threatened to fracture the council, with dissenting members insisting that proper procedure be followed. As a result, the council announced it would accept nominations for prime minister, and it received dozens of names. However, none of them was made public, and the council has been criticized for its lack of transparency, including not sharing what criteria it was applying when choosing a leader. The council also is tasked with choosing a new Cabinet and appointing a provisional electoral commission, a requirement before elections can take place. The council\u2019s non-renewable mandate expires Feb. 7, 2026, when a new president is scheduled to be sworn in.", "summary": "Garry Conille faces a monumental task, with Haiti under siege by gangs that control at least 80% of the Port-au-Prince capital.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/haitis-new-prime-minister-vows-unity-in-first-statement-since-being-selected", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/files-haiti-unrest-politics.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:53:58", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.001}

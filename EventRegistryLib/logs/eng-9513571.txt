According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice, businesses that incorporate coaching alongside training see a significant 80% boost in employee productivity. Agile coaching, in particular, plays a vital role in enabling individuals to refine their skills, embrace effective practices, and tackle challenges like motivation and dedication. This approach fosters continuous improvement and empowers teams to adapt swiftly to evolving demands in the workplace.\n\nPournima Bhor: Can you tell us about your background?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: My name is Siddhesh Dongare, and I currently work as a Product Manager at Mastercard Open Banking Business. I have accumulated over ten years of experience in product and project management, during which I have developed a strong skill set in leading teams and successfully delivering projects.\n\nI am an accomplished Agile coach and have devised the Agile Iteration for Data Mining (AIP-DM) methodology. My contributions were recognized when I was awarded the prestigious Agile Coach of the Year accolade at the India Agile Awards 2024, hosted by UNICOM in Bangalore. This award underscores my commitment to promoting excellence in Agile practices within the industry.\n\nFurthermore, I am a published author known for the book \"Shape Your Life by Changing Perspective,\" which focuses on personal growth and transformation. I am delighted to share that I was honoured as the winner of the Business Mint Nationwide Awards Under 40 Entrepreneurs & Industry Experts in 2024 for my work on the book \"Shape Your Life by Changing Perspective.\" My recent recognition as Agile Coach of the Year at the India Agile Awards 2024 highlights my dedication to advancing Agile methodologies in the professional sphere.\n\nPournima Bhor: What made you want to get into Agile coaching?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: Since 2008, I have been teaching IT subjects at Satyam InfoTech, a computer institute in Kalyan, and mentoring students for their career growth. My passion for teaching and mentoring naturally led me to Agile coaching. Transitioning into coaching in the corporate world allows me to apply a more hands-on approach. In 2014, I was honoured as the \"Most Agile Employee of the Year\" by the company, an accolade that further fuelled my commitment to Agile coaching. Overall, my passion for Agile coaching is grounded in the belief that it can catalyse positive change, enabling organizations to become more resilient, responsive, and successful in today's rapidly changing business landscape.\n\nPournima Bhor: What challenges have you faced as an Agile coach? How did you overcome it?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: As an Agile coach, I faced various challenges, outlined below, along with how I addressed them:\n\nAs an Agile coach, I addressed these challenges by employing a combination of communication, education, and fostering a culture of collaboration, with the mindset that Agile transformation is an ongoing process requiring patience, persistence, and a commitment to continuous improvement.\n\nPournima Bhor: What makes you a great agile coach? How would you motivate your Agile team?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: Honestly, I may not have all the answers to what makes a great Agile coach, but based on feedback from internal stakeholders and respected professionals who know me well, it appears that I am recognized as a skilled Agile coach. I believe it's because I consistently focus on learning, pay close attention, listen well, approach problem solving through a cultural lens, and communicate effectively. It feels good to be acknowledged for these qualities as a great Agile coach.\n\nTo keep the Agile team motivated, I organize regular activities such as 'thought of the day,' puzzle-solving sessions, and 'Chai Pe Charcha' (Tea Time Discussions) to boost team morale. Motivating the team involves understanding their personal and collective goals. As an Agile coach, I always prioritize building trust, fostering open communication, and instilling a sense of purpose. By aligning individual goals with project objectives, recognizing achievements, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement, I inspire the team to collaborate and deliver high-quality results.\n\nPournima Bhor: What are some examples of procedures that have been implemented to ensure high-quality results?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: I consistently pushed for both individual and team adherence to a 'no mediocrity policy' for work deliverables, reinforcing the commitment to delivering high-quality outcomes. This involved focusing on quality over quantity and maintaining a low bug count. I consistently conducted regular retrospectives where the team reflected on their performance, identified areas for improvement, and implemented necessary changes; it was a standard practice. I regularly organized activities such as 'thought of the day,' puzzle-solving sessions, and 'Chai Pe Charcha' (Tea Time Discussions) to boost team morale. I always promoted a culture of continuous improvement by recognizing achievements and encouraging the team to learn from both successes and challenges.\n\nPournima Bhor: What would you recommend to aspiring Agile coaches or those interested in Agile leadership?\n\nSiddhesh Dongare: To excel in Agile coaching or leadership, embrace responsibility and ownership. Encourage team members to take charge, fostering empowerment and accountability. Promote collaboration through open communication and mutual respect.

The session, attended by 30 participants, covered a range of topics including various e-commerce models, online marketplaces, and strategies for optimizing presence on platforms like Amazon and Pinterest. Additionally, insights were shared on website development using Shopify, search engine optimization (SEO) techniques, and the practical utilization of tools like SEMRUSH and Google Search Console.\n\nMeanwhile, in Gori, Davit Papiashvili, managing partner of \"Creston Georgia\", led a discussion on crucial tax matters. Attendees gained insights into tax payment obligations in Georgia, with practical examples illustrating calculation methods.\n\nBoth workshops provided invaluable knowledge and tools for entrepreneurs to enhance their businesses.\n\n* The first Georgian cafe of Japanese fancakes \"Pumpula\" is a partner of TBC\n\nA special interest in Japanese culture and cuisine began in Georgia with the twenty-first century. First of all, the new generation shows this interest. Young people's love of anime usually leads to an interest in Japanese reality shows in general, including cuisine. There is no lack of lovers of Japanese cuisine in Georgia, so every news - opening of a new restaurant or adding a previously unknown dish to the traditional menu - always arouses the interest of the customer.\n\nIn this regard, the \"Pumpula\" cafe, opened a few months ago, was not an exception - the first place in Tbilisi where Japanese pancakes (and not only) are prepared. Japanese pancake is a dessert that quickly gained popularity all over the world thanks to its distinctive taste and appearance. Japanese pancakes are distinguished from classic ones by their volume, airiness and souffle-like structure. This effect is achieved thanks to extraordinary technology. The ingredients are traditional - eggs, sugar, milk and flour, but unlike the classic pancake, the Japanese version is much healthier - the minimum amount of flour and sugar is used here. This, along with the taste and structural features, is another characteristic that accounts for the universal popularity of Japanese pancakes.\n\nThe founders of the \"Pumpula\" brand - Davit Janelidze, Temur Gegelia and Arseni Yudin - decided to open a similar cafe eight months ago. According to Davit Janelidze, the decision was made after they noticed how popular Japanese fancakes are in Italy and Turkey:\n\n\"We wanted to introduce something really new to the Georgian food market, and that's why we stopped at Japanese pancakes. As soon as we opened the first facility, we became very active on social media and people immediately grabbed our desserts - mostly they posted them in short videos, because these pancakes, apart from being delicious, are also very visually beautiful. After we realized that the idea was justified, we started thinking about expanding the business. TBC Bank helped us a lot in this. We took part in the TBC Startup program and got a loan for opening a new branch easily.\"\n\nA new branch of \"Pumpula\" was opened in Vake, at 81 Abashidze street. Unlike the object located on Orbelian, which is 15 sq. m., the Vake branch occupied 90 sq. m. Here the concept is also different.\n\n\"At the Abashidze branch, we added Japanese cheesecake - a delicious, airy dessert. We also added Japanese dishes - gyoza, tempura, etc. Here we also have breakfast type pancakes - benedict type, with eggs, as well as - with ham and eggs. We are often visited by Japanese people, and it probably won't be a brag if I say that they really like our cafe. The reason is that the classic Japanese pancake does not have such a variety of sauces.\"\n\nPancakes with chocolate and banana are the most popular in the cafe, but you can also taste pancakes with raspberry, strawberry, tangerine, caramel, tiramisu and other sauces - the choice is really diverse.\n\n\"Pumpula\" is not just a food facility, it is a unified, well-thought-out concept. Creating an image of it begins with the brand logo, which depicts a colorful Japanese cat, obviously very pleased with something.\n\n\"The positioning of the brand is unequivocally friendly - we make sure that \"fluffy\" and our pancakes cause only positive emotions, both for adult and small guests, as well as for employees. We have a rather liberal attitude towards the staff. Discipline is important, but strictness and a toxic environment are completely unacceptable. We have both experienced employees - for example, our chef Dimitri Kitriashvili - as well as staff who have no experience at the time of hiring, and we train them. We often employ students. By the way, in cooperation with TBC Youth, we have a 20% discount for student card holders. As for the price policy in general, we try to have prices as low as possible, and the salary of the employees, I can safely say, considering the Georgian market, is quite good. This is very important to us and is part of the overall satisfaction and positivity generated by the brand.\"\n\n* TBC and EBRD Financing Boosts Lopota Spa Resort Expansion\n\nTBC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have provided 9.4 million euros to fund the expansion of Lopota Spa Resort, scheduled for completion in June. The project includes the construction of new facilities such as the Green Aqua aqua park, an 80-room premium-class building, a jazz club, and additional conference spaces.\n\nThe Green Aqua aqua park, spanning 2000 square meters, will accommodate over 300 guests simultaneously and features nine different attractions, bungalows, and relaxation areas set amidst a forest of local trees and plants. Weekly jazz evenings will be held at the resort, with plans for large-scale jazz concerts throughout the year.\n\nConstruction is underway for a new four-story premium-class residential building, comprising 80 rooms, three conference halls, and a rooftop bar, expanding the resort's room capacity from 232 to 312. A 35-meter swimming pool and a bungalow have also been added near the new hotel building. Furthermore, three new conference spaces for up to 250 guests each will be incorporated, increasing the resort's total conference rooms from six to nine.\n\nAdditionally, Lopota Spa Resort will receive a grant and technical support through the EBRD's Skills In Business (SiB) program, marking the second time the EBRD has supported a local Georgian company through this initiative. The SiB program aims to enhance Lopota's workforce skills, thereby bolstering its competitiveness in the market.\n\n\"Lopota Spa Resort has been on a journey of continuous development since its inception in 2008, pioneering local tourism in Kakheti. This year, as we unveil our new facilities, we not only enrich our resort's offerings but also contribute to the tourism landscape of Kakheti. We are grateful for the steadfast support of our partners, particularly TBC, who have been with us since the beginning,\" remarked Giorgi Kevanishvili, executive director of Lopota Spa Resort.\n\nGiorgi Tkhelidze, Deputy General Director of TBC, expressed pride in TBC's longstanding partnership with Lopota Spa Resort, noting the significant growth from its humble beginnings to a thriving complex. He emphasized TBC's commitment to the hospitality sector and highlighted the importance of the financial support provided to Lopota, particularly in the context of the country's recovering tourism industry.\n\nTBC's investment in the hospitality sector, which includes tourism, has played a pivotal role in driving Georgia's tourism potential, contributing to the sector's recovery post-pandemic. With international tourism nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023 and continuing to show strong recovery trends in 2024, the collaboration between TBC and Lopota Spa Resort is poised to further elevate Georgia's tourism landscape.\n\n\"We are happy to support another expansion plan of Lopota Spa Resort together with TBC Bank.\" Tourism is an important part of the local economy and Lopota has the necessary potential to be in a leading position in the Georgian tourism sector. With a variety of guest rooms, infrastructure and high-quality full service, Lopota successfully attracts both local and international guests. The EBRD is confident that this project will contribute to the development of regional and local tourism in the country. Along with the financing, Lopota will benefit from a grant and technical support under the EBRD's Skills in Business (\"SiB\") program, which aims to promote employment, retention of skilled employees and work-based learning. These aspects are crucial not only for the development of a qualified workforce, but also for companies to be able to retain qualified employees in order to remain competitive in the market\", - Alkis

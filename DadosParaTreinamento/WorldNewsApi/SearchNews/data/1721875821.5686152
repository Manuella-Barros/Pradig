In a six-month period in 2021, we experienced a devastating heat dome resulting in the highest recorded temperature in Canadian history. The next day, most of Lytton burned to the ground. Four months later, an atmospheric river inundated the region with a month\u2019s worth of rain in just 48 hours, cutting off communities for weeks and claiming the lives of five people swept away in catastrophic landslides. In 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the memory of Lytton to illustrate the impact of climate change as he called for global action at COP 26 in Egypt. In August last year, the 170-square-kilometre Kookipi Creek fire ripped through the Fraser canyon. Much of the Reo Rafting eco-resort was destroyed. Owner Bryan Fogleman is now committed to not only rebuilding his business, but also supporting Indigenous-led efforts to mitigate the impact of future fires.", "summary": "Byron Spinks: Indigenous guardians in permanent, full-time positions would develop fire management plans and weave together traditional knowledge and Western science.", "url": "https://theprovince.com/opinion/op-ed/byron-spinks", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/theprovince/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/year-diary-photos-20211213.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:00:20", "author": "Byron Spinks,Hardip Johal", "authors": ["Byron Spinks", "Hardip Johal"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.03}

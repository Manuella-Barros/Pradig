{"id": 243323686, "title": "When carnival fever swept through Birmingham and everyone was 'happy", "text": "Summer is finally here and the weather is brightening up and we all look forward to carnival season. There was a time when every area in the Midlands that had its own carnival. Roads were closed, families were spotted having a ball as floats travelled down the high street - and there wasn't a phone in sight. There are a few remnants of the 'good old days' with Harborne Carnival still going strong along with Handsworth Carnival. Other smaller events seem to have turned into a car boot sale and a fun fair. Don't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the BirminghamLive newsletter here. We take a look back to some of those days and remember them looking back with our 'rose-coloured spectacle' firmly on. Strange we only seem to remember the days when sun shone and forget about those others when it poured with rain.", "summary": "A look back at the 'much-loved' carnivals around the region", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/nostalgia/gallery/carnival-fever-swept-through-birmingham-29392020", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29392942.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Birmingham-Caribbean-Carnival-1969.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:56:00", "author": "Marcus Queenborough", "authors": ["Marcus Queenborough"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.066}

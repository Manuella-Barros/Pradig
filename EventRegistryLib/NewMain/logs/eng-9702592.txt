In December 2022, Pant met with a mishap while driving to his hometown Roorkie. Pant sustained several injuries due to a collision and he needed nearly 15 months to recover to make a comeback to competitive cricket.\n\nPant returned to action in the last season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Delhi Capitals captain secured his place in the T20 World Cup squad. Pant featured in all of India's matches in the competition, including the final in Barbados. He put up some commendable performances with the bat and showcased brilliant glovework on a few occasions. In his eight appearances at the T20 World Cup, Pant registered 171 runs at an average of 24.42. He completed 13 catches during the campaign while contributing in one stumping.\n\nAfter becoming a T20 World Cup champion, Rishabh Pant posted a video featuring his recovery process. He wrote, \"Blessed, Humbled & Grateful. God has its own plan.\" The video opens with Pant walking with the support of crutches. In the end, the southpaw can be seen lifting the T20 World Cup in sheer jubilation at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.\n\nThe post grabbed the attention of many cricket fans who appreciated Pant's grit and determination. A social media user branded Pant's journey as \"one of the best transformations in the history of cricket.\"\n\nWishing a brighter future for Pant, another person commented, \"God bless!! You have had an incredible journey and many more to come.\"\n\n\"From the brink of disaster to World Cup glory. Your comeback is legendary! Overcame the odds & brought home the World Cup. From setbacks to a stunning comeback, you're the definition of a champion,\" read another response.\n\nAfter the accident, Pant was rushed to a hospital in Dehradun and underwent initial treatment there. The cricketer was then airlifted to Mumbai where the BCCI's specialist consultant took care of him.

From enduring the dangerous car crash to lifting the T20 World Cup trophy with Team India, it has been nothing short of an extraordinary comeback for the star wicket-keeper batter.\n\nPant's car met with an accident when he was heading back home ahead of the New Year. His vehicle ended up in flames but the cricketer managed to survive miraculously. He sustained grave injuries in the accident and it took him nearly 15 months to recover before he made his comeback to competitive cricket in IPL 2024 earlier this year.\n\nAfter impressing for the Delhi Capitals in the IPL, Pant booked his ticket for the T20 World Cup and was preferred over Sanju Samson as India's first-choice wicket-keeper batter. Pant didn't enjoy the best of campaigns in the tournament but played a few important knocks to help India lift the trophy. He also showcased some good glovework behind the stumps.\n\nAfter becoming a T20 World Cup champion, Pant took to his social media handles on Wednesday to share a compilation video of his journey from being injured in the car crash to lifting the trophy for India. Expressing his gratitude, the wicket-keeper batter wrote \"Blessed, Humbled & Grateful. God has its own plan.\" The video has garnered a lot of love from fans, who have hailed Pan for his remarkable comeback.\n\nPant scored 171 runs in the T20 World Cup 2024 for India at an average of over 24. He also completed 13 catches in the tournament and inflicted a solitary stumping. Pant was the third-highest run-getter in the tournament behind Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav.\n\nThe victorious Indian team departed from Barbados for home on Wednesday after being stuck in the island nation for three days due to Hurricane Beryl. A special Air India flight was arranged to get the World Cup-winning squad back home and the flight left the Caribbean shores on Wednesday afternoon.

The flamboyant cricketer was rewarded for his consistent performances and picked in India's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup. He played all the games at the marquee event and fared decently. The legendary Sunil Gavaskar praised him for his fitness as the 26-year-old looked quite lean on the field.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 2, Pant shared a motivational video across his various official social media handles, showing his journey from recovery to becoming a world champion.\n\n\"Blessed, Humbled & Grateful. God has its own plan,\" the Haridwar-born wrote in the caption of his inspiring video.\n\nPant failed to open his account in the final as he fell for a two-ball duck. However, he was excellent behind the stumps, taking two catches of dangerous batters Aiden Markan and Heinrich Klaasen. The left-handed batter finished with 171 runs from eight innings at an average of 24.42 and a strike rate of 127.61. His highest score of 42 came in the high-voltage clash between India and Pakistan.\n\nPant has been rested for India's upcoming five-match T20I tour of Zimbabwe. He is expected to return to action during the Sri Lanka series, where India will play three T20Is and as many ODIs.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1719078820787_Untitled-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702592", "eventUri": "eng-9702592", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1038, "textEnd": 1044}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The victory came after a tense match against South Africa, where India clinched the title by a narrow seven-run margin. This win not only affirmed India's dominance throughout the tournament but also sparked jubilant celebrations across the country.\n\nThroughout T20 World Cup 2024, India showcased remarkable consistency, winning all eight matches they played. Key players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, and Rishabh Pant delivered standout performances, each contributing crucially in different matches.\n\nFollowing their historic win, the Indian players have been unwinding and enjoying their success. Recently, wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant shared a heartwarming image on Instagram, proudly displaying his World Cup medal. The post quickly gained traction on social media, prompting an outpouring of congratulatory messages and admiration from fans worldwide.\n\nThe camaraderie within the team was evident as Axar Patel and Mohammed Siraj good-naturedly teased Rishabh Pant in response to his post, showcasing the close bonds and joyful spirit among the Indian squad amidst their victorious mood.\n\nBeyond the Indian team, unexpected praise came from Pakistani pacer Shaheen Afridi, who lauded India for their stellar performance and T20 World Cup victory. His gesture highlighted the sportsmanship and mutual respect that transcends fierce on-field rivalries.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan's disappointing campaign, failing to progress beyond the initial stages, prompted introspection and criticism within their cricketing community. After their impressive journey to the final in 2022, this year's performance fell short of expectations, leading to calls for strategic reevaluation and team restructuring.\n\nFormer Pakistani cricketers, experts, and fans voiced concerns and advocated for nurturing emerging talent to enhance Pakistan's competitiveness in future tournaments.\n\nAs India celebrates their T20 World Cup triumph, the focus now shifts to maintaining their momentum and preparing for upcoming challenges. The victory not only brought immense joy to millions of cricket fans but also reaffirmed India's status as a cricketing powerhouse on the global stage.\n\nWith players relishing their hard-earned accolades and the nation basking in their success, T20 World Cup 2024 will be remembered as a pivotal moment in Indian cricket history, signaling a resurgence and setting new aspirations for the future.\n\nSEE ALSO: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli Cherish T20 World Cup Victory With The Silver Trophy Inside Air India Flight- Watch", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/75626/75626_emv3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702592", "eventUri": "eng-9702592", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.615686274509804, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Virat Kohli announces his retirement from Twenty20 internationals\n\nThe new Mumbai Indians captain was a shadow of his past and was constantly booed by the fans.\n\nHis game too cracked under the pressure, and along with all these issues on the field, social media was abuzz with rumors of Pandya's impending divorce with his wife Natasa Stankovic, a former Bigg Boss contestant and dancer.\n\nRuns continued to elude him during the early phase of the World Cup, but the talented all-rounder compensated with his bowling, which brought his confidence back in his batting. He scored in the Super Eight, including an unbeaten half-century against Bangladesh and a quickfire knock against England that swelled the total.\n\nSpecial moment\n\nPandya's biggest contribution came in the final against South Africa when he turned the match on its head, dismissing the dangerous Heinrich Klaasen to bring India back into the contest and followed it up with two wickets in the final over.\n\n\"It's very emotional, something was not clicking, but this was something the whole nation wanted. Special for me after my six months, I haven't spoken a word, things have been unfair, but I knew there'd be a time I could shine. An opportunity like this makes it all the more special,\" Pandya spoke about his travails after winning the trophy. \"We always believed, stayed calm, let the pressure come to them. Last over, I knew I had to execute my plans. All of a sudden my run-up speed increases. I have been in this situation, I enjoy the pressure situation.\"\n\nPandya's cool head will be vital for Team India to move forward after the retirement of skipper Rohit Sharma, talisman Virat Kohli, and ace all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.\n\nThe 30-year-old showcased his exceptional leadership qualities when he guided a young Gujarat Titans team to the IPL title in their maiden year.\n\nPant's remarkable comeback\n\nBut Pandya's hardships pale in comparison to Pant's, after the wicketkeeper's near-death high-speed car accident.\n\nThe crash left the 26-year-old with a damaged ligament in his right knee, a hurt wrist and ankle, and abrasions to his back. Doctors at one time contemplated amputation of his right leg, but thankfully there was no damage to the nerves, which helped Pant get back on his feet.\n\nHe fought back after an intensive rehabilitation programme and time on crutches at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.\n\nPant's return has given the Indian batting the stability to move Kohli to the opener's role, where the talisman scored runs heavily in the IPL this season. The progress made by Pant, both physically and mentally, in the World Cup will be important for the future of India.\n\nEven though Pant had strong competition to regain his spot in the Indian World Cup team, the team management had immense faith in his abilities and hence he was anointed the No 1 choice. The left-hander did not disappoint them and was at his best with both the bat and his wicketkeeping.\n\nPant took three catches during the win against Pakistan in Group A to earn the best fielder award from former Indian all-rounder Ravi Shastri during the team awards ceremony in the dressing room.\n\nBut after the initial flourish, Pant could not live up to the expectations as the tournament advanced. Now with Kohli hanging up his boots, Pant needs to replicate the game-plan of his fellow Delhi star. If Pant takes a leaf out of Kohli's book and adapts to the changes the talisman made in soaking up the pressure and unleashing towards the end, he could give India a winning total in the final at Barbados.\n\nThe future outlook\n\nIn fact, Pant could be the dangerous finisher, much in the mould of former Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with the top three slots in the Indian Twenty20 team potentially going to the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Shubman Gill.\n\nStill, Pant possesses the talent to make it count. From crutches, he is ready to bolster the Indian team's fortunes in the next decade. When the bus carring the champions parade the Marine Drive in Mumbai comes to a halt, a few stars will bid adieu and then it will be the turn of Pandya and Pant to steer the wheels of India's fortunes.\n\nImage Credit: Image Credit: Image Credit: Image Credit: India's Hardik Pandya bowls during the ICC men's Twenty20 World Cup 2024 final cricket match between India and South Africa at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on June 29, 2024.

The exhilarating final in Barbados saw Rohit Sharma's team clinch a nail-biting victory over South Africa by a narrow margin of seven runs, securing their second T20 World Cup title. Across social media, cricketers poured out their emotions with heartfelt posts and celebratory snapshots, each player proudly displaying their hard-earned trophies.\n\nAmidst the serious reflections, a lighter side emerged as teammates engaged in playful banter. When Rishabh Pant shared a photo on Instagram holding his World Cup medal, Axar Patel and Mohammed Siraj seized the opportunity to tease him good-naturedly. \"Bhai mere pass bhi hai. (Brother, I also have the same medal),\" joked Patel, with Siraj chiming in, \"Bhai mere pass bhi hai same.\"\n\nThis camaraderie extended to Yashasvi Jaiswal's post where he shared emotional pictures with the trophy and a caption that spoke volumes. \"Can't explain in words,\" he wrote.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav, known for his wit, couldn't resist adding a touch of humour, advising Jaiswal with a playful twist, \"Mat kar SOJA (Don't do, sleep).\"\n\nAlso Read: 'Brother on His Side': Rohit Sharma's Mother Posts Son's Pic From 2024 T20 WC Win With Virat Kohli\n\nNonetheless, the joyous spirit extended to India as well, where the team received a hero's welcome despite challenging weather conditions upon their return. Hundreds of enthusiastic supporters gathered at the airport, waving flags and banners adorned with messages of congratulations. The celebrations will continue with a scheduled meeting with the Prime Minister followed by an open bus victory parade in Mumbai. The grand finale will be a felicitation ceremony at the iconic Wankhede Stadium, where fans will gather to honour their cricketing heroes.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-2024-07-04t131612.045-2024-07-5dc6fc534d60dcccd8270b7cb7f3fe8d-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702592", "eventUri": "eng-9702592", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

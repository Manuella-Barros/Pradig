Jake Blight, Australia\u2019s Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and one of Australia\u2019s most experienced national security lawyers, stated that unclear regulations can negatively affect the role of a free press. \u201cExcessively wide or uncertain secrecy laws can undermine trust in government and unreasonably impact the important role of a free press and civil society groups,\u201d Mr. Blight said in his review on secrecy laws handed down on June 27. He highlighted that current definitions of offending are too imprecise, and stressed the need to avoid broad terms such as information relating to \u201cthe functioning of government.\u201d His review recommends scrapping the use of security classifications, such as \u201ctop secret,\u201d as a basis for an offence. Instead, he advocated for changing the law to make it an offence only to release information that harms a security agency\u2019s operations, capabilities, technologies, or the methods and sources it uses to obtain information. \u201cDisclosure of information about the core intelligence operations, capabilities, technologies, methods, and sources of Australia\u2019s six main intelligence agencies will almost always be harmful to the national interest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it does not follow that all information to do with those agencies will always be harmful. \u201cThis is particularly so for agencies whose functions have expanded beyond traditional intelligence functions and now include assisting other bodies\u2014such as the Department of Home Affairs\u2014with their functions.\u201d The report cites broad cybersecurity information, commercial mapping, and routine administration as examples of material that should not be captured by secrecy laws. As he embarked on his review, Mr. Blight questioned whether the fact that a government official has stamped a document secret should automatically give that stamp an effect in law. \u201cShouldn\u2019t sending someone to jail be a matter of a judge deciding whether there\u2019s been harm or risk of harm?\u201d he said in an interview with the ABC. \u201c[But] the core of that offence is deciding whether an official put a stamp on a document. \u201cWe have literally thousands of national security laws. About 3,000 plus pages. That\u2019s about the same number as the complete works of William Shakespeare, Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, and all three volumes of Lord of the Rings added together.\u201d While Mr. Blight admitted there was \u201cundoubtedly information that [has the potential to] cause harm,\u201d he emphasised that there has to be a balance in empowering our national security, police, and law enforcement agencies to do their work. \u201cThe journalist has potentially committed a crime the moment they intentionally receive that document. Before they\u2019ve done anything else with it. Before they\u2019ve assessed it, before they\u2019ve copied it, before they\u2019ve published it. And there\u2019s certainly being put to me a lot that this has a chilling effect and isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d Divulging classified information carries a seven to 10-year sentence. Senior lawyer Kieran Pender at the Human Rights Law Centre supported the report\u2019s recommendations. \u201cUnnecessary and disproportionate secrecy is bad for democracy.\u201d Greens senator David Shoebridge also wants to see an overhaul of Australia\u2019s secrecy laws. \u201cWhistleblowers like Julian continue to pay an unfair price for telling the world the unethical and criminal actions of governments. \u201cWe must stand with them, and we must ensure that the legal structures we put in place are there to protect them, to tell truth to power and ... not go to jail for the privilege.\u201d", "summary": "Australia's security watchdog has recommended setting up a dedicated whistleblower protection authority and changes to the law.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/assanges-release-sparks-call-for-protection-of-whistleblowers-5676851", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/28/id5676901-20141113001060270266-original-Jake-Blight-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:24:56", "author": "Rex Widerstrom", "authors": ["Rex Widerstrom"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.105}

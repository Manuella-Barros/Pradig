Excerpts What is your assessment of the current administration under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, most especially as he celebrates a year in office? Firstly let me congratulate President Bola Tinubu, on his one year anniversary of Renewed Hope Agenda. It is a journey with a lot of turbulent and challenges for Nigerians through some unavoidable policies that were initiated to uplift our dear country from the dungeon of economy quagmire. With all sense of humility and modesty, we must appreciate the people of this country for their endurance, perseverance and unflinching support as we pass through the dark tunnel but one thing that is certain is that after this temporary pains, we shall all leave in abundance. However, there is a need for us to understand that government is continuous. The present administration acquired both assets and liabilities from the past administration and it will not be easy to right the wrong within the space of one year. In lieu of this, it will be too early to begin to assess the administration of four years in just one year. But with all these challenges, let us look critically on the strategy initiated by this government in transforming the various sectors of the economy which is encapsulated in the 8-Point Renewed Hope Agenda to inspire confidence, trust among Nigerians, promising a new era of hope and transformation. With the introduction of two major reforms in the economy by the president, that is the removal of fuel subsidy and merger of foreign exchange rates, it is a good intention of redirecting funds to critical sectors like healthcare, education, infrastructure, among others. With all sense of responsibility, these reforms have started yielding good results already. The importation of petroleum has reduced by 50 per cent and has also boosted investor confidence, making the Nigerian Stock Exchange the top-performing bourse globally. Although these policies brought about some inconveniences to Nigerians, but the president, who is compassionate about the welfare of Nigerians, is working tirelessly to bring up initiatives and programmes that will cushion the effects of those policies. Can you say the President is on the right path of achieving his Renewed Hope Agenda? Absolutely, the Renewed Hope Agenda have inspired confidence and trust among Nigerians, with a promise of a new era of hope and transformation in the area of economic rebirth, improved national security, significant investments in modernising and equipping the nation\u2019s security forces, with over 4,600 hostages freed, more than 9,300 hostiles neutralised, and over 7,000 terrorists and bandits arrested, all to ensure a safer Nigeria. In fulfilling the Renewed Hope Agenda in agriculture, a state of emergency was declared on food security with National Agricultural Development Fund with N100 billion launched. Dry Season Farming Initiative as well as the Green Imperative Programme aim to promote year-round farming and provide farmers with access to modern equipment and low-interest loans were put in place to ensure food abundance. Also, the Renewed Hope Agenda Infrastructure Development Fund was put in place with aim of raising N20 trillion to deliver critical projects such as modernise ports, aviation facilities, thereby creating an enabling environment for businesses. The present administration is also expanding primary health centres and upgrading tertiary hospitals, to ensure better access to healthcare. In the area of education, the student loans Act 2024 and the establishment of the Nigerian Education Loan Fund highlight a commitment to broadening access to quality and affordable education was put in place. Social welfare schemes, such as cash transfer and microcredit programmes, aimed to uplift vulnerable households and support small businesses, accelerated diversification through youth-driven Industrialisation, digitisation, Innovation and improved governance for effective service delivery was also put in place. With the aforementioned policies, there is no doubt that the administration is realising it\u2019s Renewed Hope Agenda gradually. With his policies and governance style, how optimistic are you that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu will meet aspirations of Nigerians after his four years in office? I am highly optimistic in the sense that the policies and programmes of this administration are in short and long-term towards revitalising, and revamping of the economy towards meeting the aspirations of Nigerians before the second anniversary of the present administration. Ahead of the subsequent elections in Osun State, what are the parameters your party has put in place to reclaim the party in 2026? The All Progressives Congress in Osun State is currently embarking on accommodating new members, and to reconcile existing ones in view of building a stronger team that will give us victory in the next election. The results of this pragmatic efforts of the leadership of the party in bringing all the aggrieved members together through conflict resolution and mediation is now yielding positive results. Recently the BOT Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Suaibu Oyedokun and Dr. Dotun Babayemi were welcomed with their large number of defectors into APC in the state and many are still coming. In addition to that, the party, under the leadership of Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola, the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, is not leaving any stone unturned through engagements and consultations. Just recently, there was a state-wide tour led by the party Chairman in the state, Alhaji Tajudeen Lawal to review, appraise, and evaluate the strength of the party and to know its challenges across the local government with the aim of repositioning it through critical analysis of areas of strength and weakness to improve and implement the recommendations of the reconciliation committee, for the APC to remain a formidable party in Osun State. Additional step taken by the state leadership of the party is to constitute three committees, namely; reconciliation, appeal and disciplinary committees in order to address critical issues affecting the party. With the reconciliatory steps put in place, which is ongoing, all members of the party will see reasons to be united in the pursuit of progress and oneness of the APC in the state. How will you describe the tenure of former Gov. Adegboyega Oyetola? The administration of former governor Gboyega Oyetola witnessed tremendous advancement in terms of good governance that impacted in the social and economic lives of the people of the state. During His Excellency\u2019s four years in office, there was unprecedented transformation in the health, education, agriculture, infrastructure and rural community development etc. Despite the fact that the federal allocation at that time was meagre, Oyetola, due to his rich experience from both private and public sectors, was able to utilise the meagre resources in such a way that every sector was touched which affected the lives of the masses in the state positively. The former governor also ran an open and participatory government through creation of Civil Engagement and I was appointed as a Special Adviser to run that office. The idea was to bridge the gaps between the people and the government\u2019s policies and programmes. The civic engagement created a window where all citizens are regarded as stakeholders in decisions making and execution. The policies and programmes of government had human face, well appreciated and embraced by the people of the state and that is why till today, the achievements of the immediate past administration is still standing tall for all to see. In a nutshell, the administration of former Gov. Oyetola was eventful, impactful and witnessed a total transformation of all sectors of the economy for the benefits of the masses. The landmark achievements in the ministry of Marine and Blue Economy in testaments of his performance from state level to federal, having increase revenue generation to the level of 92% within the first quarter, the seaport infrastructure also upgraded, there are promotion inland of dry ports, among others. You were a lawmaker, who represented Obokun Constituency in the Osun State House of Assembly. Could you recall the relationship between the legislature and the then executive arm of the government? As the Chairman, House Committee on Information and Strategy, working with other liberal, productive and experienced legislators in the 6th Osun State House of Assembly, I can say unequivocally that the parliament had harmonious relationship with the executive. Although we used to have strong disagreements based on principle, the situations were managed by mature elected stakeholders who knew their onions. They did not allow our disagreements to get noticed by the public. Being a high-performing assembly, issues were rather resolved through dialogues and negotiations. We reconciled all differences that existed between the executive and the legislature. Such disagreements were necessary for the development of our dear state. As a representative from my constituency in the 6th assembly, I contributed my own quota in the areas of good representation, lawmaking, and community development. I made myself abundantly available to my people, awoken hope among the youths, ameliorated poverty, created opportunities, built confidence, empowered rural farmers, and inspired change, which up till now I am still sustaining. As a former member of the defunct APC PCC, do you think Nigerians are getting the dividend of democracy they voted for? With utmost sense of humility, dignity and modesty, I wish to thank all Nigerians who freely gave us their mandate to govern this country. Although, the task is herculean but we are gradually navigating through the storm and challenges the country is passing through. In the real sense of it, this present government is working tirelessly on how to stabilise the economy, foreign exchange rates, inflation and price control. With the initiatives and programme designs for good governance by the president, we are getting to the coast of self sufficiency and economic stability. Our people should believe in the leadership of President Bola Tinubu and the Renewed Hope Agenda of his administration. In due course we shall laugh last. What do you think the government at all levels should give priority to now, when Nigerians are lamenting \u2018hardship\u2019? The government at all levels must look inward in the area of agriculture, industry and services to contribute more to the Gross Domestic Product at the national level. In revamping the economy, we must invest more into Agriculture by encouraging the use of modern machinery and equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and irrigation systems to significantly boost agricultural productivity. The government can provide subsidies or loans to farmers to facilitate the adoption of mechanisation and promotion of efficient farming practices, draw up policies and programmes, make regulations for those concerned with agricultural development, create finance research, establish farm settlements and supply vaccine and quarantine services.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"354\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Oyintiloye-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Oyintiloye-1.jpg 354w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Oyintiloye-1-228x300.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" /></div>\u00a0Honourable Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun and former state legislator, in this interview with KAZEEM AWOJOODU, talked about how masses are currently battling the issue of inflation, Oyetola led-administration, Nigeria\u2019s insecurity challenges, President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration, among other sundry issues.
